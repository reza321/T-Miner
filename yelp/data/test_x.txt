went with really high expectations but turned out to be huge disappointment the worst quesadilla and the  guacamole dip we have ever had and seen ordinary food it is byob so that might be the only positive for us not at all worth for money they charge .
grimaldis pizza is okay but given the reputation and the fact that people stand on line to go there i was expecting it to be a lot better .
lovely restaurant tucked away in the  area of fort greene homely vibe and ambience and amazing mix of  eastern cuisine .
i recently visited the new location having been a fan when they were right next door the line for waiting still remains but sadly the old charm and fun is gone the new location is drab and the pizza was not as flavorful .
bohemian decor  smelling could use a good cleaning but terrific food great combinations of flavors in small tasting portions we really loved the food .
there is much better pizza in brooklyn but if all the tourists want to wait in line and leave the other places free then im fine with that .
lamb meatballs in a spicy tomato sauce with whipped feta and mint this was meatball crack meatball  hands down the tastiest balls ive ever had in my mouth id   to those balls if they came with legs lol .
i dont understand how this place got a reputation for good pizza i got suckered in did the 1 5 hr wait left so disappointed not worth your time or money stay clear i promise you wont regret it .
amazing happy hour and great food all the time i recommend the quince pitza the baconwrapped  and the patatas bravas service has improved over the years .
you can do better that this place rudest staff .
super yummy food one of my favorite restaurants in brooklyn they have a terrific brunch the bloody marys are amazing the weight can be a while for a table at times but not to worry sitting at the bar is nice too .
more fad than quality pizza is good but one can taste the fuck the  in it it is something that comes along with the legend .
great brunch spot always crowded turkish breakfast and oj is really incredible .
dont waste your time waiting on those long lines the other location in  queens has less crowds .
got the polenta and eggs which was incredibly good decent prices and cute decor prepare to wait if you come for brunch but they provide stools to sit on outside and theyre actually honest about wait time which is refreshing .
pizza mediocre service sucks they just dont care not worth it .
solid food great local restaurant in ft green .
huge line cash only no slices the hell kind of business is this .
lived here for four years and olea by far my fav brunch spot turkish breakfast is so hard not to order and savory  toast is amazing .
the manager treats clients like animals he made us wait in the rain outside and kept screaming at us to get in line and move we ended up leaving i have never been treated like this in a  this place is not worth going to .
super tasty  fusion the coffee is meh though and our waiter never refilled our water glasses left feeling full without feeling stuffed .
tourist looking for nyc pizza this place has a grade pending on the health department i  this rating and it is not good check these places before you eat people .
seated promptly back in november after we went to kings county   we were hungry somehow we ended up here we were seated right away probably right time place but we had a delectable meal drinks it was warm cozy yummy .
there is much better if you search in the nooks and  of nyc grimaldis is good but highly overrated .
one of my favorite restaurants a bk gem veggie friendly fantastic date place beautiful ambiance and solid service you need to try it .
if you want tasteless pizza this is the place for you really overrated crust was good but sauce had no flavor and prefer regular mozzarella as fresh mozzarella doesnt melt well .
great good and staff had brunch green eggs and lamb sausage i asked for a ramekin of their herbed yogurt sauce which rounded it out really well i would eat that meal every day .
checked this place out several years ago after hanging out at the park the food was ok but not worth the wait and the hype i guess its good for the  .
gotta get the roasted beet  prices are okay but there are good happy hour specials during the week can get really annoying when people bring their kids because its a small space .
dont go here its not actual from brooklyn its just some tourist bs that belongs in times square support your actual local pizzeria its not 1 star only because its hard to mess up pizza .
without a doubt the best french toast ive had in new york and im a french toast person .
wait wasnt very long 5 minutes but to long for the quality of pizza wouldnt come here again sat upstairs which was crazy crowded the service was painful to deal with save your money to eat at papa johns or frozen pizza .
great food even better cocktails great ambience but of course the location  it though ive been here just for dinners olea is also a great place for brunch and lunch the service is great staff is friendly and courteous i will definitely be visiting again .
is it worth the wait i dont think so so much better yes its under the brooklyn bridge and all but so is the calexico taco truck save your time and go to its not rays much better sorry but true .
the half hour wait for brunch was definitely worth it great ambiance fresh delicious ingredients unique mediterranean menu friendly staff .
bland this pizza place would be amazing if you lived outside new york metro area big disappointment for the 45 wait .
love olea ive been many times for brunch a couple times for happy hour and had dinner too and it was always good the spanish pitza is amazing love the decor too .
first and last time the staff is unfriendly the pizza was bland hardly any sauce it didnt taste fresh the crust lacked flavor it was the texture of stale bread some other couple had completely burned crust literally covered in  maybe we were fortunate .
i love this place dinner or brunch everything is delicious thats all .
the new location is not the same we were very disappointed with the pizza the taste does not compare to the old grimaldis definitely no longer worth the wait .
great food mediocre cocktails .
this place is not worth the hype line the service sucks and the pizza isnt amazing its just normal  .
wow excellent place had the saturday lamb special 16 and a virgin  lamb special was tasty and deeper than i expected like a deep dish pizza you underestimate it has a bar outside seating and tables inside service is very good .
delicious pizza though not the best ever worth the wait perhaps not the waiter was a bit short with us while ordering and rarely stopped by to refill water or grab another beverage .
absolutely amazing tzatziki was delicious lamb meatball sandwich and falafel covered artichoke heart sandwich were incredible everything came out hot and delicious its such a sweet neighborhood gem .
people are so rude who work here they said fu about 10 times to my friends and me pizza was horrible and tasteless like the people working there .
quite the tasty egg scramble  with zucchini olives feta with nicely toasted bread jam the accompanying potatoes salad were average but all in all the eggs put it over the top come prepared to wait 2030 min for a larger group on a sunday morning .
very good pizza but tourist  rush you in and out waiters unfriendly staff you could find delicious pizza all over town this is new york city wont be back and p s i live a short walk away and an original new yorker .
a reliably delicious restaurant time after time great space great service great overall my only complaint as a   please quit raising prices the tapas prices have doubled since 2010 .
i cant believe i waited in line for this place big tourist trap and i fell for it our pizza crust was burnt i dont understand how it has all these good reviews maybe the owners write them .
ive never had a bad meal here or anything but stellar service only strike against this place is that its a bit noisy .
i never got to try the old location and hence the old oven in my opinion i am a victim of the hype machine the pizza was average .
my favorite restaurant in brooklyn delicious food at great prices outrageous prices at happy hour brunch on weekends is scrumptious lovely wine and drink selections .
they treat you like they dont want you to be there and they dont care they just throw the pizza on the table and leave terrible service definitely not good for a date or a business meeting .
absolutely delicious tapas loved the patatas bravas plenty of options to be had as a vegetarian too which is always appreciated beautiful atmosphere with lots of  and even live music on a tuesday night and strong hot  .
terrible wait over 1 hour specifically asked for a well done pizza and received a raw undercooked pie dirty silverware and waiter who kept pushing cannoli dessert since it moved locations pizza hasnt tasted the same not recommended anymore such a disappointment .
i love every single item on their menu but i dream about those almond stuffed bacon wrapped dates  so .
long lines will keep you wondering if you should stay dont bother the pizza is not the best and not worth the wait unless you have nothing else to do and need a cheap bite .
i love their small plates and their drink selection the lamb meatballs are always a must as well as the cabbage salad and bacon wrapped dates this is such a cute restaurant nice service and an adorable bar great lunch time date place such a perfect restaurant .
grimaldis has a new location in a historic looking building at the corner given its fame this new location does it more  .
me love olea its consistently great and has been over the 7 years i have been going there whether its the small plates risotto no longer on  sad pasta or pork chop its always good its definitely a neighborhood  and gem .
long wait outside long wait inside pizza average im sorry to say not worth it meh .
changed my mind i had an absolutely delicious dinner here with a really nice waitress im going again tonight if its as good as last time of course i wont be writing again .
this place is closed i walked over the bridge and was looking so forward to trying it out only to find the awning and a bunch of kitchen items laying in the space next to the restaurant .
whats not to love nice decor staff food the bar is great if a little cramped but if you want a great mediterranean dinner without any pretension come here affogato dessert is not to be missed .
quick service and turnover not impressed with the quality of pizza not worth the wait very loud music playing while you try to enjoy your pizza .
was an all around great meal .
completely over rated tourist spot burnt pizza shitty service so much better throughout ny .
yum just had an amazing  soup w crazy good whole garlic  in it and artichoke falafel soo tasty .
not worth they hype the wait was long and the pizza turned out to be mediocre however i would try it again .
just go the tapas are amazing i also like the salads and the broccoli rabe pasta dish i never have room for desert so i cant comment on that .
atmosphere is fun service was really nice but the pizza eh pretty mediocre maybe because of all the hype i had expected something amazing and mindblowing what i experienced was decent pizza but nothing i would go out of my way to ever eat again .
i like this place mostly for brunchlunch great bloody marys yummy food nice vibe i have never been disappointed .
pizza wasnt hot crust was very chewy i wasnt impressed lucali is the best .
good sandwiches .
sassy  service the place gets by on its great oven and good ingredients but any idiot can throw good ingredients in a great oven and have a pretty good pizza massively overrated .
from the oh so tasty almond stuffed bacon wrapped dates to the yummy spicy feta dip more everything me and my friends have eaten here has been great always a treat when i come to bklyn bonus  guitar player last night too .
mostly hype not all that great for what could be a ridiculous wait ive had better all over  once was enough decent experience bit of tourist trap .
breakfast or any time this is the spot for great food in a relaxed and fun atmosphere i go here often everything is delicious but make sure to try the bloody mary which is perfectly spiced and i love the apps .
so not worth it waited over an hour for chewy flavorless pizza not to mentioned being squished in between another couple our local pizzaria is so much better never again .
tasty tapas and sangria whats not to like .
the line the loooooong wait the price not worth it i really dont know what the  fuss is about this place and i dont know what ever make them think that i would like  chewy rubbery pizza tisk tisk .
one of my faves ever best happy hour in new york city .
very bad pizza does not worth the money and definitely not the standing in line .
its always a wait but its always worth it i could maybe live off of the orecchiette pasta dish and the space itself is so beautifully designed there is a sense of leaving brooklyn when you walk through the door .
after 30 dollars for a pie and 2 drinks i wish i would have gone to my regular pizzeria the service was great the place was immaculately clean but the pizza was not worth it at all .
really solid brunch spot these guys know how to cook scrambled eggs seriously you dont realize how much you get crappy eggs until you come here and have theirs super creamy and fluffy and their greek scramble was a perfect mix .
not worth the wait or the hype it was the most unremarkable pizza ive had at a pizza place edible but not enjoyable service was fine and the prices were not outrageous so 2 stars .
tasty brunch .
ok this pizzeria is just over rated there are a lot of better pizza in the city this is just nothing special the service was bad dont waste your time there are a lot of delicious pizza around  .
an awesome brunch includes full bar large well done meals for about 12 top notch coffee with many free refills attentive service comfy ambiance olea has  and is my new favorite in the area .
di  is much better .
one of my absolute favorite restaurants in brooklyn ive been many times for breakfastlunch and have never had a bad experience its the first place i take friends visiting from out of town the falafel crusted artichoke hearts are beyond delicious and the .
after waiting in line for about a hour and watching celebrities walk out i expected more what i got was less sorry but this pizza was tasteless and undercooked san   in little italy by far makes this place a laugh .
the food at olea is varied and consistently tasty the wine and cocktail selection is excellent and the atmosphere is tops salads are especially delicious not to be missed .
this place is terrible a complete tourist trap with incredibly rude staff owners and a massive wait .
despite the busy nature of saturday afternoon brunch this place doesnt stop delivering high quality delicious food a beautiful cozy atmosphere and really pleasant waitstaff who keep us caffeinated and happy its well worth the wait and has become my new weekend spot .
overrated overpriced half of my pizza was burnt at the bottom the other half was delicious .
great food and service had a great time with my girlfriends on saturday night i love the pork chop dinner .
not as good as everyone is saying good yes but not wow and certainly not worth the wait in line and travel time it took to get there .
i like taking my friends and family here great atmosphere and convenient to where i stay when i visit brooklyn once or twice a year the food is like 4 stars .
not worth the wait the pizza was good but 2 hours in the hot sun never again .
one of my favorite local spot for lunch amazing leg of lamb sandwich often sold out though .
horrid customer service if you want takeout theyll ignore you like the plague the man out front pretty much  customers out of the line with complete disregard for how long people have waited as for the pizza mediocre .
this is one of if not the best brunch i have had in brooklyn from the service to the atmosphere to the ridiculously delicious bloody mary to the meal no need to say more go here immediately and then hit up the brooklyn flea afterwards .
yuck .
amazing brunch .
there are a lot of good things about grimaldis but pizza is not one of them the walk over the bridge the view the pics of famous peeps on the walls these are cool the service the horrendous lines the cramped quarters the mediocre pizza these suck .
olea is a great neighborhood spot with an interesting menu and great happy hour tapas i find many of their main dishes to be oversalted so i tend toward the small plates every time regardless .
my friend will kill me but im sorry to say the sauce killed it good crust good mozzarella bad sauce definitely not worth the wait and way overrated sorry friend .
my favorite restaurant in the hood delicious tapas platters and brunch service is good and cool chill ambiance can get crowded .
seriously overrated overpriced this place is a tourist trap the pizza was unremarkable ive had grilled cheese sandwiches with tomatoes that impressed me more save yourself the trip the time waiting in line and the disappointment .
great for brunch turkish breakfast is an absolute must the service was great but the speed leaves a little to be desired which is really more a product of the  number of people waiting to  their goods than the attentiveness of the staff .
guys do not waste your time standing in line for this pizza is ordinary service is atrocious people are rude and it is  pricey do not  bad food and worse behavior spend your hard earned money on something to be proud of .
yummy salad goat cheese croquettes ricotta bake hanger steak and my friend said the branzino was delicious every course we had we thoroughly enjoyed .
leave it to the tourists i would never wait one hour in line for this pizza .
this place is a goddamn joy and thats all im going to say about it .
i wasnt blown away ive eatin at better places i would have hoped to have had a way better tasting pizza after that long wait but it wasnt i did enjoy the decor and the welcoming feeling .
olea has very good food and service drinks are strong it is very small but its cozy and very welcoming .
the ridiculous wait pushed this place down to 2 stars for me its not like any of the pizzas tasted bad but it was nothing special nothing memorable except the wait are new yorkers just seriously deprived or something you guys need to come to california .
awesome brunch spot really delicious food with clean flavors one of my favorite restaurants in the area and one of those restaurants i wish i could have taken with me when i moved .
the pizza is mediocre and the doorman is a huge douche he tries to get you out in 45 minutes this place is all hype as  by the number of tourists caveat emptor .
best restaurant in fort greene .
this is just average pizza the most enjoyable part of this experience is walking across the bridge take off a star for the  wait .
the brunch here is fantastic it is really crowded on saturdays when the brooklyn flea is in town so go on sundays the turkish breakfast dish is my main stay sunday brunch seasoned scrambled eggs pita bread all kinds of delicious mediterranean sides .
o  two stars grimaldis gasp all you want it was a big disappointment after waiting 45 minutes in line sure they use fresh ingredients but 15 is much too expensive for a rather bland pie that i could easily eat all by myself .
best brunch in ft greene dinners are very good too .
the atmosphere is nice and the service pleasant enough but my cappuccino was a latte and a mediocre one at that im not planning on going back there .
small intimate dining area with a homey and inviting feeling food was fantastic from the tapas to the entrees nothing was overly filling or seasoned .
terrible coffee i had the red eye which tasted like burnt charcoal my wife describes her raspberry mocha vanilla hot latte as  sweet nice service though .
olea has the best brunches in the neighborhood as well as the best bartender thomas i wanted a hot mulled wine the other night which is not on the menu and he   the best drink from heated sangria wine and other goodness love .
coffee is not bad and the spot is convenient but the food is terrible and service is meh at best good stop for a quick coffee break but not more than that .
great for brunch although the wait was painful turkish breakfast was delicious portions were perfect also recommended the awardwinning bloody mary with raisin puree .
you will leave hungry not drunk and broke i would recommend just getting oysters and move on to a real meal goodness forbid if you are  and over .
no longer byo on tuesday but still an excellent restaurant .
came very far to try discount lobster roll they say they dont have lobster roll do not advertise if you cannot have .
visited twice once for brunch and then for lunch in a 1 week period this is a great spot local character relaxed and some killer lamb sandwiches green eggs and  sausage with pleasantly attentive service and appropriate liquid options .
 bland oysters the clam bake for two was disappointingly flavorless 90 and im still hungry we are leaving this place highly disappointed by our  i dont understand the positive reviews about this place even at 1 a  i was ready for some real seafood .
been here twice the tapas dish bacon wrapped dates is awesome must get selection of wines are nice too beautiful atmosphere great service cannot say anything bad about this place even saw the other tables ordering chicken fingers for their kids .
we like the casual atmosphere and the friendliness of the wait staff and the affordable prices however the service was terribly slow and we had to ask repeatedly for simple things like water and utensils the food was not good .
delicious food cozy comfortable space a killer selection of drinks had the bacon wrapped dates so so good drooling now thinking of them and this place seriously had one of the most pleasant restaurant bathrooms ive ever been in .
i used to eat there a lot as a student i returned to find the food very very poor and far from fresh many of the lunch specials were just  from a serving tray much of the food was difficult to eat .
a charming place on a beautiful fort greene corner food is consistently good you can order two size meals off of most of their entree menu i usually go for the appetizer size and then order some tapas or a salad its really a fun place .
i just had dinner there tonight sorry but i dont understand the 4 star reviews .
had a lovely brunch here before hitting the brooklyn flea on saturday almost came back for the 12 price wine happy hour will be back to try the other menus .
have no idea  this place the food just sucks not as good as the reviews showed cant  how came the 2 seafood curries which is 9 75 respectively including only 2 little shrimp n some carrots  in it i mean please do ur business .
fish was the tastiest ive had since living in spain  were slightly dry overall loved this place and the variety on the menu .
we were pretty disappointed with this place the prices are reasonable especially for wine but both the pad  and the green curry were  sweet .
this is a great restaurant for just drinks or with tapas or dinner its absolutely lovely with a fantastic menu .
welcoming and simple food the  pickles good shrimp tempura udon ok the chairs  have a back it can be uncomfortable but also cool another neighborhood surprise with bar and  i rather eat a chinese noodle at  .
fantastic food organic selection good service cozy atmosphere perfect for brunch .
had the  with curry udon it was put together so haphazardly that the curry hadnt been mixed into the broth one piece of carrot and one cabbage leaf no joy .
lovely i felt like i was back in barcelona or a warm sunny island even though its just the start of spring great fresh food and cozy atmosphere time  by so quickly .
nothing at all for vegetarians vegetarians stay away all of their stock is fish stock and the place smells like it everyone else enjoy .
the turkish breakfast here is insane so much delicious food also tapas are greaaaat especially the dates wrapped in bacon and stuffed with almonds  also everyone who works  nice restaurant itself is also really nice and airy also you should go also .
no star deserved cant be even worse they want us to pay before we finished and added tips into the bill wo asking worst service ever ugly fat women as waitress .
this place serves an amazing brunch highly recommended make sure your ready to wait for a table .
i got hives up and down my legs after their udon my friend who also is in love with udon west went on a separate occasion recently and also got hives on her face what is going on .
we went to olea for the nye prixe fix and loved every minute of it the food was delicious the atmosphere was perfect its nice to have a neighborhood spot that manages to stay consistently good .
i was in town for an hour went to udon west on yelp recommendations and was sick until the  day salty nasty food they do have great service i will give them that bad yelp .
such a great experience here has a really cozy wood cabin feel inside even amongst the med flare i tried the hot spiced sangria and it was unforgettable also had chicken with pomegranate yogurt which was excellent looking forward to seeing live music there next time .
its actually a japanese bar so the place was quite loud the food especially combo and the price were good .
love the turkish breakfast i am addicted their dinner is amazing too really friendly staff and lovely atmosphere great neighborhood place .
very rude service old man who was our waiter has no idea what customer service means im usually pretty generous but i would leave zero stars if possible here if possible .
great place to grab brunch i am a big fan of both the chocolate filled croissants as well as the green eggs and lamb incorporate either of these and you will be a satisfied patron .
very mediocre menu and the quality of food was decent at best there are other great udon japanese places around midtown east that i would much rather go to so i dont think id ever come back .
loved it had a great time really enjoyed the decor and  w mash potatoes very fair service i wanna go back .
bad service took more then 45 min to bring it out when came out cold pizza send it back to warm up again took more then 15 min to bring it out i have been there more then 10 times here before never had such a bad service .
went here for a light dinner of tapas and loved every bite the staff is excellent and the service quick particularly enjoyed falafel encrusted artichoke hearts and of course the sangria .
pizza was similar to a frozen pie nothing special there are many better pizza options in the area .
cheeses and hummus hummus and cheeses tasty tapas good service and a cozy atmosphere if i lived in the neighborhood id probably become a regular .
found a dead roach in my calamari .
plain great a wonderful  and  by a smart and  menu nestled in a quiet residential strip of a thriving fort greene permeated by a vibrant community feel .
bad service i had to wait for my food for 40 minutes after  about it and then had to wait another 20 minutes to get a check after asking for it i am not going back to this place .
one of my favorite restaurants above average food and great service the space is simple yet elegant and has fabulous light avoid sunday brunch it is too crowded .
if you like 70s wood paneling budweiser and your typical old school underwhelming bar food this place is for you .
good food and wine the pita dip sampler thing was good but the hummus had a weird texture service was good atmosphere was great menu was varied enough to keep things interesting would definitely go again .
basically olive garden all over again this is not a tip its a review a tip would be find somewhere else to eat .
the atmosphere is awesome and who can beat their oyster happy hour oh and drink enough beer or wine to use the bathroom youll want to tear the walls off your own afterward .
new to mall next to cheesecake factory light entree  was tasty   program difficult to use we like the  flatbread but wished it was on whole wheat not white bread .
great ambiance delicious savory interesting you must try the dates stuffed with almonds wrapped in bacon scrumptious menu the wait staff was a little wacky but if you want really delicious mediterranean cuisine olea is the place to go .
the wait staff are great my server was horrible the food was ok took my parents there for their 40th wedding anniversary the serve apologized  at the end when it was time to pay go figure i would never go back ever .
beautiful new  bar and delicious food .
the restaurant seemed dated the food was overpriced and underwhelming i would not come back .
just ordered in from them it was a great meal with more than ample portions our favorites were the eggplant appetizer with balsamic dressing mozzarella and roasted peppers and the gnocchi with bolognese sauce we will definitely order from them again complements to the chef  m .
was not a fan of this place very bland curry that lacked the  you would expect let alone the heat crab rangoon was so forgetful my husband just reminded me we ordered it girl at the counter was sweet seems like theyre going through some opening pains .
today i had the salmon over escarole and white beans and it was delicious at every visit ive been impressed with my meal choice molto bene .
i really want to like this place because it reminds of the small lunch joints in seoul but this guy puts that nasty frozen vegetable mix in kim chee fried rice string beans corn and carrots wtf no fried egg on top  bits of kim chee sigh .
this place looks like a hole in the wall from the outside but its our go to take out chinese theyre really fast and the food is good we always get free sodas too .
seriously this s hole methinks definitely not ive tried way better waste of money and stomach  .
ive been to quite a few chinese restaurants this one is by far one of the best the food is always fresh and delicious the people are friendly this is always my goto for chinese food .
patio is a mess broken tables trash and a distinctive smell of dog poop and garbage wth  clean up a little .
some of the best chinese ive had clean and fast delivery the guy who takes orders has a sense of humor that  u call bavk to order .
one star for the nice patio but the last time i was there the salad was oily and inedible burger had to be sent back appetizers were ok service definitely lacking too bad new haven has so few options for outdoor seating .
roast pork  is amazing along with everything else delivery is consistently fast .
slowest service ive had in a long time wont give them a second try .
best chinese food in the area delivery can be a little slow but well worth the wait .
i ordered the duck big mistake it was completely well done by the time it came to the table it also lacked in flavor everyone elses dinner seem to look better than mine .
for chinese food its pretty good i get general tsos bean curd and they make it well .
very small portions for the price slow service our food came out at different times my boyfriends dinner was served 20 minutes before mine not going again .
found this place on a fly chicken and broccoli was yummy and the noodle soup is delicious they also can make their fried rice with brown rice which is a plus .
simply awful the potatoes were undercooked meatballs tasted canned fish was unfresh lamb ravioli was  an enormous disappointment given  otherwise exceptional reputation stay away .
its good stuff for a cheap chinese takeout place theyre kind of slow usually but i see them back there  fresh veggies and all so its for a good reason .
one of the biggest dining disappointments ive had in connecticut nothing like its sister restaurant in new haven this location features underwhelming food and the absolute worst and slowest service ive encountered lately absolutely wont be coming back .
one of the better if not best chinese delivery in the bloomfield area .
beware when you order bottles of sauce i bought 2 weeks ago one and the best by date is  it should be traditional but its now a gross  bottle of uneatable crap .
its our goto chinese restaurant in town theyre quick cheap and the food is actually pretty good .
2 a slice what do you think this is nyc nothing special you have better choices in bayonne .
this is probably my favorite pizzeria thus far 2 for a regular or sicilian slice yeah pretty awesome .
ive been here a couple of times and cant state enough how over priced and low quality this food really is 16 dollars for  and cheese also the decor is mismatched and confusing .
ive had a lot of pizza in my life i have to say this place has the best pizza i think its the sauce they use 1 in my book .
we just had the worst service ever from this place the waitress wouldnt let us put three table small tables together for 6 people even though no one was in the place then she told us that we could go somewhere else so we left .
loved the nick hollywood we ordered during happy hour also ordered the mac and cheese and the fries which were great .
decent drinks but too loud too crowded and too  for my taste at least .
lives up to its reputation as a top steak house on the national scale .
my experience was not terrible but i got some  food poisoning after eating here if youre willing to take the risk go for it .
great ambience great happy hour their food is very good the portions are as expected from any pricey restaurant paltry would i go back maybe once every now and then but not that im dying to go back .
walking past the happy hour sign 11am 8pm 5 beer 6 cocktails we decided to have a drink after the show  on saturday at 530pm at the bar we were told happy hour was only on weekdays beware of false advertising .
one of my favorite spots in brooklyn heights great place for a few apps and drinks or dinner the macaroni and cheese and brussels are amazing a must try .
service sucked sat at the bar for five minutes while three bartenders chit chatted in front of us never gave us a menu or took a drink order .
i randomly came here on a saturday night with my boyfriend i loved it food was delicious and decor and service was great as well i had the duck and he had the muscles both entrees were excellent highly recommend .
buy an id  or hire a better bouncer if you have a nj id dont bother coming here at night .
bar seat beer bread burger mussels fries .
terribly slow inattentive service pretty empty and in a bad location unless youre coming from the  the waitress served one in our party the wrong beer even after she questioned it overall nothing special enough to go back to .
went for happy hour and really enjoyed it looking forward to the next visit .
i walked in this weekend and the place smelled horrible like  and was blasting awful music my friends and i couldnt hear each other talk we left after 15 minutes no thank you .
some really good food here mac and cheese got the most praise but i actually liked the cheeseburger better .
not really impressed by the place this is a brunch review food looks fantastic but tastes lower than average drinks are not the best im town either it is quite pricey for what you get i am not coming back for brunch .
went here for my birthday had ricotta balls for appetizer very good grouper as main entree excellent and wine really good and great service i want to go back .
we were here on time but they didnt let us in or sit down because we didnt have one person coming we asked them for a favor because it was our friends good bye meal together however they  us .
unbeatable happy hour special and for quality beers wines and cocktails not just the crappy well stuff that most places try to  during hh we get the mac n cheese every single time the  veggies have never disappointed winner winner .
go for the drinks and starters and not for the main course the drinks were outstanding we each had a muddled drink and shared the hot potato chips which were great however our main course was extremely bland the atmosphere is full of life and extremely loud .
great brunch .
went for brunch baked eggs huevos rancheros food is overpriced and average cocktails also average and not included with brunch ok in a pinch but you could get so much better .
one of my favorite burgers great wine menu and cocktails just great simple food im going to miss the neighborhood .
the food is decent and the waitresses are shitty and inattentive i got served raw pork the waitress never apologized and never offered the menu or checked up on us while we waited for the dish rude service but go ahead if you want food poisoning .
good neighborhood tavern the place is consistent and a  to have in a neighborhood with so few dining options the trout salad always a treat .
the food is plain average and not cheap but youll like the location .
really cute venue good food good service much less expensive than an equivalent place in the w village they use well liquor in the happy hour drinks so not as good a deal as you might think .
being generous here the food sucked period and when you add the price factor it really sucked about an inch of loose panko on the trout needed a  to get it off moroccan meatballs i think not .
great cocktails even better burger the only problem is there is always a wait when we stop by during the week so its busy almost always call ahead and make a reservation .
stopped in for a late lunch terrible service crap oysters lousy cold underseasoned steak with no char whatsoever at these prices there are far better options pass seriously pass .
one of the best bars in nyc and my favorite spot in brooklyn heights .
the food is decent but delivery takes forever service in the restaurant is slow and discombobulated if you dont mind long waits the menu is broad and will please most palates .
jack the horse tavern did a beautiful job feeding our party of eight before a  center performance the polenta was fabulous and the heirloom tomatoes were a perfect start to the meal the setting was cozy and we will go back again .
at best this place is only ok they excel at nothing but nothing is horrible either but with so many wonderful places in nyc im amazed this place  with 14 mac and cheese and the like the service is good food is boring place is noisy .
cozy and inviting ridiculously good macaroni and cheese and appetizing salads menu is so appealing youll have trouble deciding what to order .
i dont like an egg in a tuna salad why do they put an egg in a tuna salad too salty and the place has the acoustics of a bathroom all tile .
delicious prixe fixe dinner menu highlights were the braised smoked pork belly appetizer mac n cheese and mussels in a white wine broth  mention to the peach almond tart dessert the service was attentive and friendly and the location is perfect .
when you need a lastminute reservation for 8 people on a saturday this place  but thats about it its incredibly loud and the food was barely acceptable and certainly not worth the price tag .
please dont go here i want it all to myself .
usually love this place and go quite frequently terrible front of house this time rude and inefficient food was great as usual but stuck us downstairs in the party room which i didnt know existed when there were only 4 of us disappointed .
excellent  the trip from manhattan to brooklyn heights for sure highlights were the flavorful chunky gazpacho individual vegetarian pizza peach cake and dark chocolate gelato next time want to try the mac cheese which looked great pleasant atmosphere lots of charm in a quiet neighborhood .
this restaurant gave me food poisoning i had the vegetarian ravioli seriously how do you get food poisoning from vegetarian food never go here bad beer selection and food poisoning skip .
amazing food ambience everything i ordered the hanger steak and it was arguably the best steak ive ever had their drink menu is amazing as well its tucked inside brooklyn heights and youd miss it if you werent looking for it highly recommend checking this place out .
eh i tried this place twice and both times my food was flavorless i dont understand i had to add salt pepper and even hot sauce then i decided it wasnt worth eating no more tries .
brooklyn heights is a beautiful quaint neighborhood with breathtaking views of manhattan but it is not known for its good restaurants jack the horse is one of the only standouts in the area a good spot for brunch .
bland bland bland nothing outstanding just an average sit down girls gossip dinner kind of place brunch is a bit better but not by much the mussels and french fries are reliable but thats pretty much a no brainer .
our new favorite neighborhood spot amazing for brunch especially get the scone plate .
mediocre calamari served inexplicably with heaping amounts of marinara sauce on it rendering it soggy and unappealing flat overpriced vodka tonic incredibly loud this place isnt the worst ever but nothing to write home about .
yeah man i like this place a lot last time i was there i got the monte cristo that shit makes me feel mad fat but i dig it so much i dont be caring they could put a little more horseradish in the bloody mary though .
came here for brunch with friends food was bland the eggs were tasteless scrambled and sunny side the potatoes werent crisp and the salmon was too salty our waitress was sweet .
perfect little spot with just the right touches 5star comfort food not too expensive great wine list and easy to get to off the subway .
great place except the noise is so bad the meal was not enjoyable its a shame to waste great food on such a horrible place i could never recommend this to anyone but deaf people its girlfriend jane on w houston is much much better .
my wife and really loved the food had a fantastic beet salad to start and then had the halibut which was moist and delicious good beer selection and the ambiance is great im looking forward to going back again and id highly recommend it to friends .
great standard american joint with a great selection of tap beer and very vast menu options but the wait is always killing me and especially trying to grab a 7pm dinner or a 2pm weekend brunch forget it .
great food nice airy  the smoked trout salad alone was worth the trip mmm will most definitely be back .
the food is good but if youre looking for a hip fresh sophisticated crowd this isnt the spot .
ive eaten in this restaurant many times and enjoy its atmosphere and service it sometimes gets busy on the weekends especially for lunch but its really a great spot i recommend it highly .
had a terrible pork  there for brunch they stuck out brunch party in the dismal basement people just go here because other people go here and it looks to be seriously past its prime .
a lovely upscale but still neighborhoody restaurant the food is delicious even if not particularly inventive the trout salad and mac and cheese are both standouts but the burger is quite delicious as well great for brunch dinner or even just a drink and appetizer sort of  .
i have always had a good brunch experience here but  so much we had to wait forever for our table despite having a res service was kind of bad and my short ribs were nothing to write home about .
went there for a night cap friendly service good drinks nice atmosphere but from a design standpoint i would have went with a more historic font signage to compliment the historic structure surrounding area but thats just me .
i live next to the smith and it is always very crowed at brunch and dinner time i had pot of mussels once it doesnt taste very good though it may be personal .
if you live in the heights this is a must go to restaurant if you dont its worth the trip the service is nice the chef really knows how to mix flavors have the smoked trout with almond salad its fantastic .
food was forgettable dont remember what i had as an entree beer battered string beans were really good the place is obnoxiously loud and dark definitely more style than substance .
i enjoyed the eggs orleans which is an eggs benedict type dish with a fried oyster and artichoke nice brunch menu complimented by the jack the horse bloody mary with bacon infused bourbon .
the food was alright but it just wouldnt cut it for me honestly the only reason why i went was because of the photobooth and not the food maybe it was the food i chose that was bad but i most likey wouldnt go back .
if you live in the heights you have to come here great simple food have had some problems eating at the bar some bartenders here dont seem to like it but other than that its great dark and cozy can be loud not good for kids thank god .
crowded but im starting to wonder why and for how long it will stay that way mussles were not fresh the fried stuff is good but i mean its fried of course its good overall not worth the wait .
the food was quite good i had the duck and it was very flavorful and fresh tasting the drink list is extensive and interesting and perhaps somewhat overpriced 12 or more seems common .
last night i had a steak salad delivered there was a live cockroach in it enough said .
ill be short mac and cheese gotta love the gouda smoked trout salad skirt steak absolutely delicious in an amazing atmosphere a new favorite haunt in bklyn .
horrible service crowded .
 food was awesome cocktails amazing best bartender in the world .
impressively mediocre its fast and easy but the food is nothing special sadly i find myself here way too often .
great drinks both the appetizer a special crepe and butternut squash and risotto entree were amazing this is a place that is well worth the price nice atmosphere quaint and not too crowded .
not bad just not great if you want a quick meal decent food fun atmosphere and good drinks then go its going to be better than many of the area restaurants like the  grill that it replaced .
love the hangar steak still great wine list .
ive had brunch here twice and its just too noisy ive eaten upstairs and downstairs and both times i felt like i had to yell to be heard by the other people at my table the food is good but not remarkable although my bloody mary was fantastic .
had a great valentines day dinner with my wife the drinks were really good with a great variety appetizers meal and dessert were great .
over priced over rated food not bad but the only thing special about this place is the sparkling and tap water in fancy bottles gets super packed especially now after being featured on  the city .
five stars needs no further explanation .
too loud too nyu but they do take reservations for brunch .
adore adore adore located in such a cute place ambience great food delish very romantic the panna cotta supreme d did the prix fix and couldnt ask for more will go soon again .
they advertise come to watch world cup and the manager wont turn the found on scam .
nice quaint restaurant on a quiet block in brooklyn heights food was delicious and served quickly probably bc we got there early either way i had the braised short ribs and my fiance had the free range chicken both were delish .
had lunch with six other people lovely looking sweet service and subpar food a pasta dish lacked taste a spinach pie tasted like a leftover from a bad greek diner onion and green pepper side dish totally mushy and tasteless .
at brunch this morning i tried the smoked trout salad with grapes fingerling potatoes and creme fraiche vinaigrette life will never be the same the mac n cheese is superb oh but that smoked trout salad great cocktails too did i mention the smoked trout salad .
rude waiter small portions mediocre food overpriced good wine selection though 1215 per glass .
just eat here i had the steak thinking of when i go back .
only come here if you want to pay a ton of money for extremely small portions of pretty good food .
we had sunday brunch and thoroughly enjoyed ourselves the bloody mary hit the spot i had the savory crepe for the day with prosciutto and it was quite tasty its in a cute neighborhood by the  so great for a walk afterwards as well .
really bad italian i know lots of italians in town and this isnt good at all you can pick another one for sure .
this place is a gem went for dinner and had mussels and tried the mac cheese my friend raved about the mac cheese and although i was skeptical at first it really is that good a charming place to have a glass of wine and great food .
not had the chance to enter in as babies are not welcome smart enough by saying that theres a 1 hour and 15 mn waiting time to get a table while 13 of the tables were empty very smart but not enough will never make another attempt .
its always lovely to find something unexpected jack the horse is a british gastropub on an old street with great food .
dont bring a vegan here .
great food the best take out restaurant in hartford i been eating here for over 15 years give it a try .
the food is good but the service does not make up or it they constantly  and are not hospitable in the least in a city of many restaurants this is one to avoid you will be extremely disappointed .
my favorite pub in all of philly its a place where i can kick back with a few brews and just  out my secret getaway from the regular pretentious center city spots great beer selection and killer burgers .
service uneven apps great main courses literally inedible definitely ended what could have been a nice night on an awful note i would recommend going to the bar for a glass of wine and apps only .
fish and chips was amazing fresh fish with the perfect crispy  fantastic service our waitress was so helpful and accommodating great variety on the menu we came with 11 people in our party for a saturday lunch everyone was pleased with their meal .
sorry i really wanted to like them really but come on stopped by for a quick bite just pasta they accommodated cool ordered food crappy beer selection unless you like italian beer came ate not worth 50 bucks .
 is a fantastic happy hour spot where else can you get a bottle of rolling rock at 5 on a friday for 3 seriously where great bar food and wait staff .
service service service service from the door to the end of the meal one is treated like an atm food is superb but who wants to go here get service this bad .
best bar near the  at penn free peanuts fast service from my experience think chris was on anyway five stars for extra    and a having a great beer selection .
food was good service was not didnt want anything special just a person to sell me drinks apps entrees desserts as the saying goes great service can save a bad meal but bad service ruins a good one this was ruined for me .
very trendy place great onion soup .
overpriced food was couldve been more tasty we had the pasta prefer  or  for pasta perhaps the meat dishes were better .
great happy hour convenient from 30th street station and friendly service its obviously not an authentic irish bar but its good if you are in a pinch and looking for something simple its great for  drinks for the penn fields .
dont sell us wine at the bar then tell us when we go to sit at the bar that the bar is for dining .
i recommend the following plates philly cheese steak rolls addictive french onion soup good flavor fries im usually not a fry fan these are good good beer selection good happy hour specials lotsa  going on here .
their preprepared bagel with cream cheese was old and nasty avoid otherwise its a reasonable downtown place to get your groceries at least on  .
very cool pub with authentic irish bar and great burgers beer selection is extensive and they have my favorites smithwicks and guinness live irish music on mondays also .
extremely bad services crazy people and unreasonable bar tender will never come back again give us a terrible night at new york eve cant believe these people are so cold blood and not human .
havent eaten there but a great place to grab a beer after work bartenders are helpful and nice .
french fries were horrible over cooked and bland other food wasnt that great either drinks were over thought and complicated to the point of not enjoyable will not be coming back .
quite spacious and somewhat out of busy center city district but the atmosphere clean and pleasant i got a free beer glass when i was there cool chill happy hour time on weekdays i liked it .
the rudest bartenders ever made it thoroughly unpleasant .
an amazing experience a 7 course meal and every course is more delicious than the one prior the people are so friendly a reservation is definitely recommended .
i might just not be built for places like this anymore too big too loud too crowded bunch of drunk college kids pass .
the food and service was excellent i have nothing negative to say delicious .
nice place but i all i can remember from the two times going there that it was absolutely  hot .
place to go with your family and friends hospitality is one i their pluses they make you feel like family the moment you walk in the meal is fantastic and the atmosphere transports you on an adventure communal meal was a great experience .
gets the job done .
exceptional hospitality very accommodating host usually crowded reservations for larger groups highly recommended they had a belly dancer very cosy seating food was excellent loved the pata try with powdered sugar and egg and chicken filling baklava was great .
ridiculously overpriced for tiny bland sandwiches get it while it lasts cant wait to see what comes next .
omg is all can say about this place everything was excellent .
food was good service was horrible waitress was not very helpful or friendly wont be visiting here again .
this place is incredible delicious and for the food and service really affordable also its an incredible experience definitely recommend it to anyone looking for a special and delicious night come hungry .
the doorman was so rude to my friends and i that we will never go back to this place its too bad we loved going there .
so much food but so good this is the best place to go if youre really hungry authentic moroccan food hidden in the corner of south street i love it every time .
i finally realize that the fries here arent that good what makes this place interesting is the sauces but the fries cannot stand by themselves .
great food simple and delightful atmosphere definitely going back didnt  the lamb as much as i hoped i would next time going with the kabobs 7 courses all for 33 after tax and tip great deal dont eat lunch that day .
i saw this place on some old food network show when i lived in the midwest and was instantly hooked at the concept cut to 7 years later im in nyc this place was better in my head the fries are standard unfortunately .
amazing from start to finish all courses were phenomenal service great food was amazing house wine was  dining experience was great and the belly dancer was beautiful .
so overrated i do not understand the hype .
love this place make sure you ask for a table downstairs it more  .
overhyped overpriced greasy fries with mayo based dipping sauces heart clogging i made the mistake of not checking the menu before i went small seating area couldve been cleaner cant figure out the long lines or rave reviews .
my favorite place to go .
six cockroaches were just being  out of the front door by an employee with a broom six massive cockroaches i loved this place but i am never coming back .
great for a group accommodating to groups of both  and vegetarians full bar and byo very homey great atmosphere enormous portions come very hungry there is belly dancing on weekends and during the week by your request if youre booking a special occasion .
i definitely got sick from eating the fries at this place plus they are not belgian fries at all they are larger and definitely not as light on the plus side the sauces are very good .
i love this place because it is exactly what it is supposed to be nothing more nothing less the food is amazing the price is cheap and the decor authentic they have the best baklava ive ever tasted and the chicken is incredible e servers are friendly .
waited inside for my order to finish and walked out smelling like old stale oil and then fries soggy and oily tasting like old soggy oil with dipping sauces that just didnt have the flavors whats going on with here .
awesome place with beautiful decorations there was a belly dancer which was cool be mentally and physically prepare for a 7 course meal and pace yourself bring cash because they do not take credit cards .
we were really excited to try this place long line good sign right unfortunately we went back when there was a  cold fries room temp poutine sauce and cold cheese curds yuck  it and walked out .
the place is absolutely wonderful this place is a must to go if youre in a budget looking for great food you might want to come very hungry .
very disappointed it really ruined my appetite by looking at their  deep frying oil .
a seven course meal for 25 a person yeah its a lot of food and a lot of fun bring a group of friends and your  enjoy the wine and if youre feeling saucy attempt to belly dance with a professional .
there is absolutely no point in eating there fries are basic and sauces are super fat .
once again id like to stress the excellent and cheap house wines also soooo much food you cant go wrong the spicy chicken did it for me this time around when given the choice go with the spicy .
had the poutine meh  can rest easy .
prepare to eat make sure you dont eat all day because this place will take care of your belly its a very small and cozy place .
hugely hugely overrated sauces are decent fries are just standard guy who worked here was also kind of a dick .
not much left to say about this place awesome dining experience great moroccan food but certainly not the best ive ever had the experience is really the bread and butter here bring cash also wish they would mix up the menu a bit .
just overrated although the fries were fresh out of the deep fryer they still managed to get half soggy i have lived in the   for some good years and i have eaten a lot of  those just didnt raise up to the occasion very average .
fantasic restaurant the eggplant is the best ive ever had and the mint tea just doesnt get any better in the us .
i know everyone raves about this place but i honestly dont get it we hang out on the les a lot and have been here several times the fries are mushy and need to be drenched in sauce how does that make them awesome .
good food exotic experience .
was dying to try this place went couple of times and the service was rude and obnoxious dont bother .
phenomenal .
not the best at all fries cut too thick and potatoes did not have a yummy flavor sadly very disappointed one good thing was the curry sauce spicy and delicious and very authentic doubt i would ever go back i honestly have had better fries at five guys .
such a wonderful dining experience it really was like we were eating at a friends house because by the end of our meal we felt like we were part of the family great value for the  of food i will definitely be going back soon .
smells bad from frites guess its from oil sauces are not outstanding .
we went here for a company celebration we had the entire space two levels and a 7 course meal the food was spectacular the drink selection was interesting but  i recomend everyone make it here at least once  .
i wanted to try this place because friends raved about it i was really disappointed that it was just soggy french fries drowned in gravy gross i threw it away after a few bites dont know what all the hype is .
a must i will write more but i am still  the 7 courses that we ate without a break service  and just plain fun .
overly hyped yeah i said it the truth hurts sometimes doesnt it its just fried potatoes with sauces that arent hard to make i think people get  away with the novelty of choosing from a variety of sauces .
bang on the  door in a dark alley and a man in a  will let you in nuff said a philadelphia must one of the coolest places ever .
its okay not really european fries at all okay thats all to say .
i absolutely love their pizza the sauce is outstanding ive also had their salads caprese panini and one with chicken red peppers and provolone all really good but the pizza is fantastic .
6 fries with weird sauces fries are nothing special sauces nothing special except a couple overhyped for sure prob cuz its small and its like omg they only make french fries here and i dunno personally im not impressed nor will i go again .
great pizza and friendly servers .
this place shouldnt claim to serve authentic belgian fries because they are far from authentic they are also over cooked and overly greasy a really overrated overpriced and underwhelming place .
we had rigatoni rustica heavenly linguine and franks famous appetizers food were tasty lunch menu has great value and portions recommend .
overhyped the fries didnt even taste that good neither did the satay sauce also nothing says the cuisine is authentic belgian like southeast asian workers in the store  seriously people overpriced thick fries with mediocre sauces shouldnt be getting five stars left and right .
excellent vodka rigatoni the owners and waitstaff are lovely have been coming back for years .
i wasnt impressed i tried the rosemary garlic sweet mango chutney and the parmesan  sauces and ive definitely had better in georgia it was overpriced and not good try it once just to say youve tried it and move on .
its a reasonable and a good food restaurant .
i love steak fries but this place was overrated expensive and a long line sauces were just ok maybe if the bag of fries were cheaper id give a higher rating .
i think the pizza here is the best in  friendly people always hustling call ahead and the pickup times they give are always accurate .
i didnt find anything special about the fries ive had them on two occasions and both times the fries were overcooked the only appeal to this establishment is that they have many sauces to choose from otherwise you can get better fries elsewhere .
update been back 7 or 8 times since 1st review its  never disappoints .
wish i could give it a no star rating definitely not the best fries ive ever had i was so upset i stood on line for 15 mins only to get shitty ass french fries now you officially have the supreme touch .
loved it the waitress didnt know where we could go to get a bottle of wine but other than that fantastic .
fries are good back not too long ago the dipping sauces were free they got cheap and now charge 50 cents for basic  .
dominican food mainly prices are reasonable nice smoothie variety specials of the day and the place is clean to be continued .
this stuff is so gross its that food that you feel bad for eating afterwards greasy soggy potatoes covered in warm mayonnaise ew its gross just to write it i threw mine away after a couple bites if you are a bum then go here .
yes yes yes to the foie doughnut hummus platter  fawntons duck breast beef and broccoli and steak tartar  to the squid and  fun place great concept adventurous food and delicious drinks .
update even the worst  here in belgium from where i type is  ahead of this place come here for your fry fix not for your belgian frite fix .
first off fawntons get them i always want more in my opinion this place continues to live up to the hype the staff are friendly and the food is imaginative and delicious also they make a great brunch their take on eggs benedict is delightful .
i can get these same fries at a bad diner ive been to belgium and these fries are not belgium style fries they were burnt and had no flavor the sauces are the best part .
great food great atmosphere great outdoor area fun events whats not to like .
bland boring below average fries mixed with great sauces to cover up for bland boring fries i dont understand the popularity at all .
 shots great playlist bartenders on point best dining experience in bedstuy to date very creative menu at an accessible price point .
i dont know what the hype is about i have had better fries and better sauces not worth the trip but if you are in the neighborhood and want french fries i guess its worth a try .
charred lamb breast is mouth watering pickled shots  the thirst dont ask the bus boy whats in a pickleback shot ask the waitress fusion menu good for the meat eaters out there and the veggies .
i liked the concept and the wide array of sauces but the fries themselves were lackluster ive definitely had better fries elsewhere many times over .
this place is a neighborhood gem foie gras donut that is all .
i think the premise is awesome of fries with sauces and all but really i felt so disgusting after eating it waaaaay too greasy and i am all for greasy food fries are also one of my favorite food of all time but not this time .
finally ate here the other night pretty great experience overall i think it is a little too expensive but the food is interesting and the dining experience is enjoyable especially the spacious backyard which have big tables that are great for parties service was on point great busboys .
only come here if you are a tourist who wants to look like a tourist this place has not been cleaned in ages its greasy its dirty and the fries are nothing special at all personally id rather eat at mcdonalds .
this place is great love the neighborhood atmosphere and food awesome bloody mary chicken and waffles were amazing we had venison dumplings that were so good too love the dishes they come up with cant wait to go back .
fries were soggy and the sauce was ok mcds wins my vote for best fries .
one of my favorite restaurants in brooklyn creative and comforting food and a great neighborhood spot great cocktails too .
not the healthiest came here once in search of carbs probably not coming back again contrary to many reviews here i really didnt think the potatoes or the 30 different dips were all that special .
bibimbap with sweet potatoes fries in place of rice amazing cumin lamb breast w fried egg wow i wanted more stomachs to fill here definitely coming back soon the most interesting brunch ive had in a long time .
i only went here once but my frites were overdone dark brown the sauces were good though .
cool restaurant fun and exciting menu good decor including readymade awning i like the location too the only reason for not giving 5 stars is that i honestly think they need just a couple of desserts .
these cheesesteaks are the worst ive ever had i dont get all of the hype the cheese wiz makes it worse .
we had an amazing time here last night sampled a mix of snacks and small plates and lauren the bartender turned us onto some tasty treats and the most original pickleback ive ever had this place is not messing around .
just ok and id say customer service isnt an important part of the their business plan .
chicken and waffles were amazing flank steak was a close second and the pork and beans were right behind them a great place and amazing food .
not so good anymore the last time i came here was in  and it was still yummy somehow the taste has changed now this time the meat didnt taste so fresh and it was a little chewy cheese did not improve it either not coming back ever .
cant go wrong with this place whenever i have visitors i bring them to my favorite local spot .
overrated in my opinion but you have to try it at least once i  a taste test of pats vs genos side by side and pats wins my vote however you are better off at jims or dalessandros in roxborough .
everything i had there was great love the hiphop influence on the menu justin is a genius .
genos is better but id only give that a 3 star very meh .
 hen and waffles rock killer cocktails made with care and  i love hipsters that can cook it up keep up the good work brooklyn youre doin it right .
i gave both genos and pats a two star rating because honestly i wasnt impressed by either the roll was cold meat chewy and cheese tasteless service was much better at pats at least they were friendly .
this hidden restaurant has an extremely interesting take on food foie gras donuts pond wings and more .
overpriced outside cheap ingredients add to that one of the trashiest  of patrons in the city and youve got a real loser .
sometimes it is the little things those are some damn nice napkins you clearly put a lot of through into those and we thank you good food great drinks friendly staff .
no .
this place  great old school hip hop brooklyn unique combinations of flavors and the customers gold stars for do or dine like a wind face  you just shine .
please if you are really looking for a cheesesteak do not get one from here soggy   there are so many good options in the city none of which are anywhere near this intersection .
hell yes this place is a dream come true ive been twice and everything ive had thus far has been utterly delicious not to mention a creative drink list great decor friendly staff happy bellies .
the only reason it gets a second star is for historical landmark status i threw away half the sandwich no flavor at all its like im eating canned meat i get better cheesesteaks at dennys .
we tend to be food  but hands down this was the best food ive had in brooklyn ever and quite possibly the best food ive ever had they could get a better dessert menu though .
wasnt all that impressed with the steaks ive had better elsewhere i didnt try genos tho maybe another time if steaks are your type of thing you should definitely try it ive changed my eating lifestyle so the food didnt sit too well with me .
had an amazing dinner here with my  chicken falling off the bone melt in my mouth delicious with friendly service i ate too much but i forgive myself its vacation .
simply overrated i guess if youre a tourist who wants chewy cheesesteaks and taking in the scene then its a 3 5star experience if you want a good cheesesteak theres other options .
a find on the clinton  border that id call hip hot  cuisine the fawntons venison wontons of course were tasty and the duck breast was incredible with  and fennel to cut through the richness of the medium rare  breast yum .
bad service better steaks elsewhere .
inventive fun good service excellent experience .
like genos its a great tourist spot but the steaks are average id give them 3 stars but they lose one because the next day after eating their food is a little rough .
x .
puke tourists really there is much better food in philly might be worth feeding to your grandpa if you think you might get a good  .
the food is definitely eclectic and the drinks are on another level only diners who arent used to your typical menu items should come here .
meh .
favorite restaurant in bk sign outside  people off but thats just part of the experience small inside but cute yard in back service cool waiters and bartenders food creative delicious but can be a bit pricey wish serving size was bigger .
overpriced and absolutely nothing special about it food tasted bland fries are the cost of another meal they charge what they do because it was on tv dont waste your time .
amazing service delicious food great drink selection .
if you rate this above a 1 you are probably a tourist pats and genos are both overpriced and overrated unless you are in the area and drunk at 3am go somewhere else .
never had a bad meal or bad service by far my favorite restaurant in new york and it just happens to be around the corner .
nasty attitudes from staff and how do you run out of fries on a busy day steak wasnt that great try genos .
i had such a good experience here i have got to get back .
the steak isnt that flavorful its as simple as that .
good drinks delicious food nice people .
overall mediocre food pats and genos are both overrated the lesser of the 2  is pats dont waste a trip to philly .
i love the fine quality dining deconstructed in a small  restaurant .
dry greasy nothing special arrived at 11 quick service you go here for the history and the experience not for an amazing bit to eat still glad i went .
fries lollipop chicken and the daily special were superb paired with a nice patio space out back and great staff this place is a real gem .
tourists only .
two words  nachos i could eat three plates of these seriously ive also had the duck yum and fish and chips yum my tummy always leaves here very very happy the staff and vibe are also great .
we tried pats and genos the meat at pats was disgusting fatty and tough and had a nasty flavor go to genos .
loved this great atmosphere great and crazy food nice staff we got foie gras donut taco  duck  and fennel fish and chips 2 pickleback shots 2 negro  1 bottle wine with tip the total came to about 120 or so great for date night .
one of the worst cheesesteaks i had service was bad too oil for the fries was dirty will not come back ever .
awesome i can never go back to regular waffles now .
we got two subs with provolone they were filled with thick tough and grisly meat and served with complete indifference the fries sucked and the soda wasnt even cold and they dont have a bathroom how does that sound for 30 bucks .
funky eclectic restaurant with attentive young staff order the whole fish lamb chops and chicken the duck was the only loser out of the main selections it didnt look overcooked but tasted rubbery nevertheless i would definitely go back .
they are small with very little meat cheese overpriced and very grissley .
i love this place it is so charming i always have fun here get the foie gras donut its crazy .
awful it is a tourist trap not worth the time it takes to park nor your money .
just go go in the right frame of mind which ive found includes being at least a little drunk and with good friends and then just enjoy the  fun fun fun liquor license now here no more byob .
i dont understand the hype a subpar cheese steak at best my son and i had better cheese steaks at two other restaurants while in philly it may be worth a try to rate for yourself i believe many people will not be back a second time .
fun delicious food friendly service whats not to like sharing the small plates tapas style is a good way to go but dont miss the duck .
gristle and grease fries steak and water 17 just plain bad food at tourist trap prices the city has so much more to offer .
yummy small dishes but yum mm mm .
as my review of genos i will also give this place a thumbs down its a tourist trap again the meat is too dry and has no flavor surprisingly we enjoyed the cheesesteaks at the hotel we stayed in rather than pats and genos .
fucking phenomenal some of the most fun food ive ever eaten and the most interesting restaurant in the neighborhood and the surrounding six or so neighborhoods at least sure not every dish is perfect but that just adds to the charm .
overpriced rude greasy fast food youll spend too much be treated badly and feel like crap afterwards i suggest exploring  a little more and youll have a much better experience .
i love this place pure joy drunken food everything is excellent from atmosphere to service to food every time i go plus its practically in my backyard .
pats is ok it is over rated their meet is not the best their toppings are pretty good the line can get long so pack your patience .
delicious everything was awesome but i particularly recommend the duck and the lamb also best caesar salad dressing ive had thanks justin and george .
saggy cheese stake and no flavor at all just a touristic spot to take pictures thats all you wont find the real cheese steak here neither  the street .
yay this place is creative fun and the food is pretty rad to boot its brand new and a little late evening  for people in the neighborhood bed stuy do or die .
the food was mediocre at best the meat is stale and chewy not worth the price that said if you decide to do it anyways do not let the line scare you it goes quick easily 5 people a minute .
tried this place out last friday and it was as good as everyone here says it is great ambiance friendly people and excellent food looking forward to making it back here again .
way too much bread no where near enough steak took me almost 30 years to finally give this place a try and after having tried many cheese steaks elsewhere this one was average at best .
this place is really really amazing we had the tile fish crudo foie gras doughnut tartare lamb breast branzino whole striped bass roasted chicken duck all amazing its byob right now so bring something special to drink .
there are hundreds of better places to get a cheese steak in and out of the city this is a tourist trap .
went the on an early  saturday night nice feel good staff and great food we had the chicken and waffles for comfort food and their meatball salad enjoyed both very much saw lots of different burger options being served and they looked great too will certainly return .
some people like the fat and tendon on their cheese steaks i dont there are so many other places to get a good cheese steak .
this place is legit the lunch specials are great i got the hawaiian burger which was delicious great food and great prices the service was great and the owner is a super nice guy you should definitely check this place out .
just awful steak was tough and chewy spit out a huge chunk of fat from one bite finished half the steak and i was hungry cheesteak  fries and bottle water over 15 at least the water was ok dont go .
i really love this place we use to come in on the weekends when i was a student a and every time im in town i always stop by the food is great and the service is really great great spot .
cheese steak was ok dont see what the big deal for this place is very over priced and bland better cheesesteaks in jersey .
i love this place really awesome food great bar and the upstairs is sweet i recommend burgers and the brunch .
it is ok  to start with i am not a sub eater i am sure other people will appreciate it more than i do but if i get one it must be a good one .
wonderful place whenever im in new haven i would try and come back try the  pizza it was awesome waiters were awesome both nights  and kevin are great people .
poor quality beef covered in oil and served on barely fresh bread come on give me a break people im going to checkout another place in philly next time .
yummy fries and creative burgers went there last spring but will probably try it again soon .
pats and genos are not philly for cheesesteak they are cheesesteaks for tourists oh the steaks are okay but if you want a great cheesesteak this is not the place move on down the road .
brunch is awesome the food was great i never saw the bottom of my mimosas and the prices are very reasonable biggest plus saturday brunch not a lot of places do that .
best thing on the menu is a 2 5 coke poor quality of beef covered with lard of cheese is not what i was expecting for 10 very disappointed with my first philly cheese steak in philly .
really pleasant service they hooked us up with free bloody marys when breakfast order got screwed up home smoked salmon omelette was very good and cool tunes playing .
you can get a better cheesesteak literally anywhere else in the city except for the place next door its equally bad those dirty little carts in center city have better food than this .
in my opinion is the best burger in new haven right now the food in general is solid and the service is excellent in nice weather the outdoor patio is a terrific option the atmosphere is conducive to having an enjoyable and relaxing meal with friends .
okay for a late night grab after drinking all night but you can find a lot better sandwiches in the city if you want to  flavor and tender meat .
ive been a regular customer since theyve opened box 63 has taken its own creative concept ran with it and  this is a place that caters to all tastes check it out if you havent go back if you have .
so overrated its a joke both pats and genos have become cheap tourist traps instead of trying to keep up quality .
the food was very good lobster grilled cheese with the best tomato soup ever and a pulled pork sandwich our server was wonderful the atmosphere was  its a good place to unwind and eat good food .
crap .
im a fan of this place amazing sunday brunch a couple solid house beers and solid southernstyle dishes in general i actually dont think the burgers are worth noting but would definitely recommend the jambalaya on the dinner menu great prices and atmosphere .
the steaks are all precooked in the roll and waiting for your condiments cold sad and flavorless .
ive eaten their twice nice friendly atmosphere great hamburgers pizza was good too check out the upstairs space .
go for the experience and i wont  you if youre visiting philly or something but there are better options out there cant deny an original though .
i love this bar and their staff came in and had some cocktails while we waited for a seat at  ramen the drinks were delicious the staff were so friendly a gem in the lic neighborhood .
pats used to be great but its weird and different now it was excellent in the late 90s .
french toast enough said .
tourist trap but theyre open 247 and they have quality cheese fries .
great twist and  from traditional tapas had a burger with a little something extra to it service was some of the best ive had the owner nick made it feel like home will go back for the food and atmosphere .
not as good as i expected and kind of skimpy on the meat for 9 there was a long line and i think they just wanted to push out some food there wasnt as much flavor as ginos had when i went there last month .
came for brunch with 2 kids and was pleasantly surprised choice of 3 items for 15 all of which was delicious and kids eat free unlimited coffee plus unlimited mimosas for 5 really friendly staff it was a good experience we will be back .
tourist trap go there just so you can say you did .
came here on a whim great food and nice portion sizes for the price server was friendly and decor was nice but the food really stood out looking forward to returning .
overrated and overpriced skimpy meat on roll with cheese sauce .
holy sht that is good trio chips raw fish trio meatloaf and sliders boom  closed  .
went there against our better judgement for  sake what a waste of time money and empty calories .
gerard and billy are the best the food is good here especially the trio of chips dip .
parking is not available the steak they cut too thick price is 10 sandwich little bite high the sandwich bread is tough well most of the business came from tourism how many customers will return .
really enjoyed my brunch here with my girlfriends the food was delish the mimosas flowing though more champs less oj would make it perfect the owner delightful and the server a hoot we had a blast .
as far as i am concerned this is a tourist spot like genos .
the place has a great vibe the small portions are ideal for sharing the food tasted great was fresh and priced accordingly will definitely come back .
way overrated .
emily rocks cute girl and fun she can do a   with her eyes closed .
not as good as it was many years ago cheese fries are still decent bu when i want a good cheese steak i go to steves now its a shame but they just cant hold a flame to the way they used to be .
the food at this restaurant is  it is prepared with love and a wonderful sense for detail the bread comes with sweet butter i guess honey butter which is a great specialty all staff members are very friendly and do everything to make you feel comfortable .
its just a tourist trap theres nothing special about their cheese steaks and the lines are generally really long with tourists there are plenty of better cheese steak places in the city theyre often pretty rude too the same goes for genos .
nice place very friendly and helpful waiters and has a cool vibe food is solid some menu items are better than others the lamb pops are spectacular overall id recommend it .
tourist trap dont do it i grew up in south philly and even as a kid i wasnt impressed by these cheesesteaks not to mention the price for a  has doubled in the last 10 years .
this place is amazing the best customer service you will find the staff is genuine and the owner is adorable words would never be able to describe how lucky we are to have a place like this so close to us .
the food was not very good and the fellow at the drink stand threatened to come outside and bash in my head i dont think i will go back or suggest this one to my friends .
great service and fun small dishes very cool decor good experience all in all .
my friends and i went here on a trip to  we wanted to try both pats and genos to put it simply pats tasted like chopped up white castle .
you have to try the quiche duck confit and the lamb chop eggs benedict .
the people who work here suck more than the steaks do  .
best food i have had in lic small plates great lamb chops tostadas veal meatballs brunch is awesome kids eat free bottomless  and bloodies clean great staff and fun vibe .
 .
great  food interesting choices good drinks quiet but not like a library friendly staff recommend the naan pizza maybe a little slow on the service but we didnt mind .
terrible cash only and is a tourist trap .
very convenient to the subway stop good drink selection and décor i agree with the comments a bit pricey food but come in for the drinks and a bit to eat a good hang out place .
three words dont eat here its not even good for tourists they claim they  the cheesesteak and maybe they did but they damn sure didnt perfect it save your money .
really happened in by chance ill be back great draft selection cool tunes interesting and  tapas chef and gm visited our table and treated us like  anyone who takes their business that seriously deserves to be checked out go .
its a tourist trap every true blue philly resident knows where to go .
open door is a great addition to lic the staff is friendly and makes it a point to get to know their guests thank you for making our  experience that much better .
disappointing i just wasted my time coming here theres nothing special on their cheese steak and rude service from the guy at the beverage window have that attitude if your steaks are really good and a musttry if youre visiting philly dont come here youve been warned .
went in for the first time today for brunch as was delighted excellent beer selection and interesting menu we ordered 3 items from the brunch menu dumplings and a salad everything we had was very good and the service attentive will definitely go back for the dinner menu .
nope .
great food and beers .
cheesesteak wasnt that great meat was chewey service was pretty rude not going back .
great addition to the neighborhood i enjoyed dinner there saturday night great music several small plates to share and all reasonably priced .
good for tourists not for steaks .
worth the trip plates are smaller but priced accordingly beers on tap are awesome service was exceptional ill definitely be coming back to this place whenever im in lic .
tourist trap big chunks of fatty gristle filled beef but dont worry because there is much more bread than meat go to tony lukes .
great place group had like 8 small plates all came quickly quality was high some plates were very original portions were perfect beer selection excellent service great will be going back only drawback was too much  on the stereo for my taste great addition to the neighborhood .
a little better than genos but that is not saying much i would not waste my time or money here .
best pepperoni pizza ive ever had pizza has a crisp crust and the pepperoni is to die for a must try .
skip it tourist trap .
brothers pizza is one of my top pizzas places the cheese on their regular pie is delicious i dont know whats different about it but i really like it their brooklyn pie is also very good pasta dishes are always good and fairly priced as well .
dog meat on a dinner roll this place lives on its legacy alone and is a tourist trap if you want a real cheesesteak go a few blocks away to cosmis deli and youll have the best sandwich youve ever eaten .
brothers pizza has the best diet coke and pizza their plain pizza is so good my favorite night is to eat dinner at brothers and then go to  for icecream .
they sucked just as much as genos did bad cuts of meat no seasoning nasty tasting staff were rude when we drove up on this place it looked so cool but i soon realized well after my first bit that these two places are a tourist trap nasty .
great food every time the grilled chicken sandwich was the best ever huge amount of chicken and have to love it for high protein .
pretty much exactly what sarah a said its all true .
great pizza place you gotta try the clams off the hook great family place .
pats is better than genos but the steaks are below average to average less about quality of food than tradition this the place to go after a concert sporting event or late night out .
i was impressed i ordered food for delivery and it was quite tasty delivery was very quick .
pats is a philly thing you have to go once and order your steak wit or wit out but its not good save it for when family and friends come to visit .
always fresh always good chicken tostada salad is amazing and we love their tacos soup and nachos always ready within 10 min friendly service and the hard and soft shells are made fresh love it .
i hate this place even when its 3am and im absolutely  and somebody else is buying these are still the worst cheesesteaks ive ever tasted or maybe theyre the second worst between them and genos i dont know which is the worst .
love this place food is always plentiful and on point been eating here for probably the last 10 years always solid and reliable all the time .
it was nothing great i had both cheese steaks side by side genos definitely had the  taste though pat allows for more toppings it was overhyped for a mediocre sandwich .
tostada salads are excellent more of a take out place but they do have tables if you want to sit parking lot is always busy though and a pain to get back onto  however the food is definitely worth it .
no  philadelphian would ever eat here when there are so many other places that have great cheesesteaks these are almost as bad as genos .
i had their chicken taco salad amazing grilled chicken avocado cucumbers tomatoes and lettuce in a taco shell their tortilla soup was good but spicy for my taste .
definitely better than genos definitely not worth being top 2 in philly dont buy into the hype hoagie was super heavy meat was decent after  i was upset overall you have to try it come late night no lines .
very clean and quick service very nice sized portions chicken burrito is to die for .
horrible they dont use gloves and thats gross the service is rude and the bread was barely fresh better cheese steaks in ny .
great food its always fresh like someone else mentioned it tastes better than the fast food chains my favorites are the grilled chicken breast burrito a side order of grilled shrimp .
gross dog food racists assholes dont eat a  in other words dont eat here or at genos .
i love this place always good always fresh and always consistent diamond in the ruff .
terrible food and the service is just as bad love genos .
delicious tacos i usually order the beef hard shelled tacos and my husband gets the veg options and we both love this place .
when i think of pats two words come to mind filthy and rude everyone out there reading go to jims steaks so much better and youll be treated with a tad bit more respect than this place .
the concept of this restaurant was very confusing asians who serve mexican food long behold it was one of the best burritos ive ever had and they deliver to rutgers love you la casa ill be back  sure .
this was only my second time in philadelphia and i wanted to try an authentic philly cheese steak i came away pretty disappointed the meat is low quality and flavorless the bread is not that good ive had much better cheese steaks at chain restaurants .
food is delicious great tasting mexican food at a good price blows away the chains like chipotle and moes its a hidden gem in  .
this is a nasty meal with bad service and terrible value dont let the fact its better than genos make it worth your money both are to be avoided at all costs .
great for a quick lunch or dinner i have been coming to this place for years the food is consistent and there is so much to pick from i love the soft beef tacos with rice and corn the owners are very accommodating and friendly .
not all its cracked up to be go to a non tourist place for a better steak .
i love this place my favorite is the steak fajita combo it is the best awesome food always fresh from scratch the owners are super friendly and know their texmex you wont be disappointed it is my favorite tex mex place in the area .
average cheese steaks waaaaay overpriced definitely better than genos though .
this place is great they have good tex mex food and use fresh ingredients the staff is real friendly too i would highly recommend this place .
this is certainly better than  across the street but it is basically a tourist trap the best part of the sandwich was the bread .
went for lunch and i had the italian steak sandwich it was terrific nice wine selection attentive staff not over  i suggest the balsamic calamari as an app next time i will try the special mediterranean chicken salad my friend had she loved it .
tourist trap go to  instead .
this place has improved since they first opened just had a nice ny strip steak 19 99 and ther special wings service is also a plus karaoke on wednesday nights fun time .
cheesesteak is nothing special people that works there are very rude and will not make us come back dont make good reviews fool you if you insist try it but please if im right just kindly post it its worth sharing it .
had the special kobe burger with sweet potato fries was pretty good would eat there again good place to watch a game and get a drink .
food and service is poor cashier was extremely rude it is not worth falling in line and being treated rudely by inconsiderate staff not worth the money this is a tourist trap definitely not coming back or recommending this place .
ive been coming here for the last 4 years i loved it then i love it now warm homely service a good variety and quality of south indian food i love ending with their strong south indian coffee i prefer their south indian selection to their north indian .
dont believe the hype long lines fatty  cheap steak and rude customer service not worth it .
one of the best for south indian food buffet is not to be missed buffet comes with unlimited dosa types food has right spice not too spicy or not too bland will come here often .
overpriced rude employees terrible chewy bland cheesesteaks .
good dosas other stuff is average but you basically go to a south indian restaurants for dosas right .
the steaks were somewhat dry .
this was my second time ever having south indian food which a friend of mine loves when i usually have indian food it is never at a vegetarian place i really enjoyed the buffet and the dosas were great .
if youre in philly and want a good cheesesteak go to a cart or one of the million pizza places thats where youll get a real steak pats is just the touristy crap dont waste your time .
i give this place 5 stars a bit expensive but well worth it service  is that a word food exquisite i will certainly come back .
eh its a cheese steak if you are in the mood for rude service the food is ok as long as you are loaded up on spirits the next day is usually pretty tough on the tummy but its late nite drunk food .
love everything about this place the atmosphere service and the food the food is well prepared their table bread is fresh and delicious once an awhile their coupon is  in the mail for 20 00 off on orders over 40 00 a steal deal .
ive have better cheesesteaks in suburban boston how disappointing btw this is the 21st century take credit cards .
love the pizza as an app love the  oil thing when you sit down love the seafood my husbands steak was overdone for the steak salad meal but he sent it back and it came out perfectly go there enjoy .
too expensive too dumpy too little taste plenty of great cheese steak places in the city so why bother with the original who overcharges for cheap quality food .
this is probably my favorite restaurant  a shame its 3 hours away from me i always order the same food the  pizza anyone who likes eggplant and wants something very sweet should get it and the nutella pizza for dessert .
not a fan of genos or pats they were both either rubbery or dry and the amt of stk used is very little .
absolutely love this place the service the drink selections the atmosphere the apps and most of all the pizza pretty much my favorite restaurant in vermont .
i dont know what all the hype is my husband makes better cheesesteaks at home .
great food and service we were in town for a school visit and found this on yelp highly recommended .
i only go here if im drunk and desperate the food is average at best and the price is higher than most other places genos is just as bad both as pats would say a  .
fabulous gluten free pizza was awesome with the best crust ive had in a long time im pretty sensitive to gluten and they were great and i didnt even get sick definitely recommended .
i have only been to pats once so i really cant judge i do have to say with all the talk about pats steaks i was not impressed .
got the traditional margherita pizza it was very good love the ambience and the wood fired oven not cool that they charge you 3 for every small ice tea you get its definitely a little overpriced for what you get but overall i liked the food and experience .
i prefer chopped to shaved so i tried pats over genos it was disgusting either way i would suggest you try  in blue bell for a great steak with not soggy fries .
nice atmosphere great for a date good appetizers good cocktails amazing amazing pizza fabulous service .
a philadelphia tradition but not quite as good as their competition genos steaks car parking is a problem .
this place was great the pizza crust was so good as was the pizza in general the homemade mozzarella was a must have the owner and wait staff was a i would highly recommend .
there are better places that make and to eat cheese steaks .
terrific restaurant great management fun place to go great burlington restaurant .
there are many other places are as good or much better johnnys behind  on  avenue for one .
i love this place the food is amazingly fresh and light salad is excellent dessert is amazing i love sitting at the pizza bar watching the pizzas get made the service is outstanding i have not had a better experience anywhere in burlington they are the best .
overheard some workers talking and apparently they dont know what  is also one of them said he quit smoking weed but then he forgot my order so .
excellent food and great for kids too the antipasto salads and pizza are to die for everything is delish and service was friendly and fantastic .
no big deal there are plenty of neighborhood spots that are way better than being down here the ground is always dirty and  too no thanks .
great pizza and great service will certainly go again soon .
my husband and i did a split compared both establishments if you like the plain taste of meat without any seasoning then you will like pats i personally like robust flavors bland is not for me .
best food ive had in burlington .
tourist trap go to  on passyunk ave .
i absolutely love this place fantastic pizza with housemade dough and mozzarella great drinks and beer selection really fun atmosphere great service the pizza tastes like highend pizzerias in brooklyn this is a great addition to dining in burlington .
not good there are way better cheese steaks in philadelphia dont get caught at this tourist trap .
having just had an unpleasant experience next store at trattoria  i wandered upon  there i found an amazing staff pleasant and welcoming food was great and fresh and made before you bravo verita for a great experience .
ew .
verita is sensational from the service to the freshly unique appetizers main dishes desserts and drinks they serve if you want to spend some quality time with friends enjoying delicious fare dont pass up verita really .
tourists .
love this place my first impression was awesome the food and service was great we will be returning here asap .
overrated jims steaks in west philly and tony lukes are waaay better .
another welcome addition to the neighborhood a true pizzeria in both taste and service .
not the best steak spot in the city but the best on at 9th and passyunk want better try johns roast pork .
i had take out from here last week the margarita pizza and another one with arugula on top of it loved the crust and the simple sauce will definitely visit again .
its a friggin cheesteak with a friggin  i dont need plenty of way better steaks in philly .
best italian food in milford the chef and the staff are awesome the steak and pork is out of this world great italian steakhouse havent heard of one before but this is the real deal .
i really dont get what all they hype is about i can get this kind of cheese steak any where i went to both places and split it with my husband nothing to be amazed about ppl .
have now been back numerous times for lunch the cuban panini is fantastic .
touristy average quality long lines and wait time .
found ourselves in bryant park and hungry and so lucky to stumble upon this tiny gem the wraps were delicious and so cheap 2 for 10 plus they have mango lassi to go .
pats or genos how bout neither check out jims steak for the best steak in philly order cheese whiz wit and youll know why jims is best .
great find near bryant park wraps were delicious including the chicken tikka and shrimp masala could use more diverse less spicy options for kids but menu was  yummy choices for adults .
when i think of the worst cheesesteak i have ever had pats comes to mind just go right across the street to genos trust me .
this is soooo good super tiny inside but plenty of character and the food is delicious service is fantastic and i cant wait to come back packed with locals is always a good sign near such a touristy area indian burritos .
most overrated subs i have ever had fake cheese hot dog rolls and more fat on the beef than actual meat their sub is perfect match with the city pats is located philadelphia disgusting and gross .
priced well great service i got the tiki chicken wraps i would def go back when i visit new york highly recommended .
kevin does your cheesesteak have cheesewiz pats team member look i dont have time for games here what can i get  should have went to genos screw these rude assholes how this place is still in business i have no idea go to ginos .
i have ordered one paneer roll and one unda roll it was kind of spicy and so good even though the rolls are small it was filling good to try prices are reasonable i like indian food .
steak was cold i expected much better i guess i shouldnt have for a place better known for its tourism appeal rather than its food .
chicken tikka masala roll was delicious my only complaint is that i waited about 15 minutes for it while other orders places after me were called .
steak was tough grissly maybe an off day or a bad cut of meat but wasnt impressed and do not understand all of the hype sorry phili no disrespect .
perfect meaty snack lunch or dinner i had a beef tika wrap and a chicken tika wrap for dinner and they hit the spot flavorful and satisfying there are also several vegetable wraps and some with eggs good on the go choice just watch the drip of goodness .
the funny thing about philly cheesesteaks is that other cities actually do them better than philadelphia does them exhibit a i mean come on .
amazing place to have great  in nyc authentic and  place with good options i always go for the  and add extra spice to it just works for me its a small place and they dont accept amex .
the meat was dry and flavorless genos is much better .
always fantastic dont leave nyc without a trip here if youre visiting the city there is something to suit almost every taste the rolls are flavorful not too spicy and not to oily either its deserving of the hype and great for a mid day snack too .
people who eat here are not philadelphia locals everyone knows not to go to pats or genos but if your really that desperate to blend in to where you have to pay twice the price of a normal cheese steak its still better than genos .
the chicken tikka roll is excellent and great value fairly filling not sure why they charge 0 25 extra for dipping chutney but otherwise great .
dry and no flavor made me feel like i was in the lunch line in a  somewhere overrated and so was genos go to  on germantown avenue to get a good cheese steak .
i just abt get enough of my lamb tikka rolls with the tea came w a group of friends and everyone got 23 rolls .
rude service .
great fast food near times square good for the belly and the budget .
the original yes however it is not the best if you are craving a cheese steak after a night of drinking my choice out of all the tourist spots jims if ginos and pats are your only two options then go with pats .
first time trying these bad babies yummy fresh kati rolls whats not to like must have if you are not too hungry .
not worth it i could make it better at home unseasoned meat check fake processed cheese check cheap roll check not only was the meat overcooked it was unseasoned and they scrap you the grease next time i rather just eat a plain sirloin steak medium rare .
amazing yummie roll i went on a saturday at 1045 and the place was packed chicken tikka is amazing the place is small with limited seating but bryant park is close by so to go is a good option 5 stars my new favorite place .
the worst cheese steak i ever had period end of conversation .
went here during lunch hour the place was jam packed and it took us 15 min to place our order ordered the paneer and chicken rolls both were excellent and had superb sauces found it a little pricey but thats manhattan excellent overall .
i like genos better out of the two pats had nice bread but the steaks were dried out i wasnt a fan .
amazing rolls opens late on weekend shrimp was amazing size of the roll is small so you will need 23 min tried their mango lassi which was also amazing opens late .
better than genos but  cheese steaks are better if your ever in  find  hoagies about 7 will get u a hoagie steak fries and a drink pats n genos had the nerve to charge 15 17 got all of that .
why go to any other fast food place when kati roll is an option well priced fast service and delicious make sure you get extra sauce wish there was one near us in the palm  area .
thoroughly disgusting a mouth full of grissle in every bite a  when i moved to south philly i thought there would be great steak sandwiches and pizza a total myth south philly steaks especially pats suck .
the rolls are very good we tried the unda chicken and unda shami roll the shami roll with mutton was excellent the chicken roll was good as well the shami roll was very close in taste to the kebabs on india .
overrated they are just as bad as genos i can think of at lease ten places that make better steaks .
pretty solid fast fare cant say the flavors are that robust and rolls come off as a bit dry we had the chicken tikka and the aloo potato but super tasty and convenient would definitely come here for a snack .
sorry its fuckin gross inferior cow  and chemical cheese yeah yum .
in our short trip to nyc we visited this place twice excellent rolls at very reasonable prices the chai is great as well very well managed and their manager scott is very friendly and runs a good operation .
meh wayyy overrated cute shop lots of great history and pictures but the food meh id rather go to arbys .
this place is pretty damn good i orders need roll and chicken roll chicken was little bit  but i recommend beef roll juicy tender and full of flavors .
way to expensive for ok cheesesteak living on its reputation there are literally hundreds of places better and for less money .
perfect late night snack after broadway show cheap freshly made flavorful homey feeling im not even indian skip fancy restaurants pretentious people and pretentious food and grab a kati roll as and take a  around  park and watch the city passes you by .
for all the hype i was disappointed yes the bread is fresh but i have had better cheese steaks many other places .
had the beef tikka roll and the anda shami roll the beef roll was delicious super spicy while the anda shami was slightly less spicy but still good i wish they stayed open for longer .
wow this was really bad lukewarm meat on an average roll ordered american cheese cheese was put on cold roll with warmish meat cheese did not melt same problem at genos go to steves prince of steaks or ishkabibbles .
this place was a definite must try when in manhattan .
i came here a while ago about a few years so my memory is a bit hazy i remember it was cold rainy and a bit windy i dont remember the cheese steak so that should say something about it .
scott is the face of kati roll he is a tremendous guy and the food is divine my only gripe is the lack of mango lassi this week .
went today and it was awful i dont remember this place being that bad if this place was located in any other city it would be out of business dry meat absolutely nothing special sorry .
superb vegetarian options are available here pretty nice and cozy environment i really like the achari paneer chana masala and egg roll they serve nice indian masala tea as well .
this place is terribly mediocre i had really high hopes for  reasons and pats failed to meet pretty much any of them its an average sandwich at an above average price .
i love the 2 and the 13 their chai tea is excellent too .
simply overrated sorry .
inexpensive tasty and yummy food .
i just dont get why this place gets the traffic their meat is thick and sometimes tasteless there are many better places but they are better than genos .
awesome place try the paneer rolls look for scott at the counter he will tell you some great stories .
was really looking forward to tasting the cheesesteak here what with all the hype surrounding this place honestly was disappointed have tasted better cheesesteaks in many other places .
great food had the beef and chicken rolls too good scott is one of the coolest people as well .
tourist trap please stay away from this place cheap cat meat long 20 min wait for absolutely nothing how is it even possible this place got so famous .
gets super busy especially weekdays at lunchtime but totally worth the wait the unda chicken roll is my favorite but theyre all delicious definitely get more than one .
ok this place is all hype meat is ok the bread is bit hard the lines are long its probably worth a try but it definitely didnt live up to all the hype in my opinion ah well .
really friendly people the chutney is not actually chutney but all else is on point .
nothing special especially for the  of the wait so many better options in the area .
love the chicken tikka roll it has just the right amount of spices better option than chipotle i only wish they had a location in boston please open a location in boston .
way overpriced tourist trap 15 dollars for a sandwich fries and a drink the sandwich wasnt even good i tried tony lukes the next day and found it much better tasting and a little less expensive .
a must stop when i visit nyc love this place .
one word describes this place shit ill go to jims or tony lukes next time like i know i should have .
the food at kati roll company is delicious at first i thought that 3 rolls would have been way too much food for one person but because the rolls are so small and light i didnt feel bloated also its adequately priced ill certainly visit again .
very small greasy cheese steaks if you live in philly you dont eat here this is a tourist trap .
chicken tikka roll best ever .
if pats is really trying to beat genos why are the sandwiches so much worse i ordered a cheesesteak wid onions and cheesewhiz at both hands down genos wins .
very good tasty and quite healthy but you should take two cause the rolls are quite small and the cashier told me that the bread is handmade by them and i  .
famous but not sure why got the whiz wit bread barely  steak underwhelming whiz bad had to load w ketchup to make edible someone point me to the real king of steaks pats would get 1 star if i could give ginos 0 .
very good kati rolls and the bottled lassi drink is a nice touch came here for an after work bite and this place doesnt disappoint will def come back for the paneer rolls anytime .
gross tourist trap the pizza place up the block has better steaks without the attitude .
yum random find late at night this past weekend the food is convenient and very flavorful i am also a fan of anywhere that has solid late night vegetarian options minus one star for being very tiny with no bathroom .
mean staff soso steaks pat is the steak nazi .
loved this little place everything very fresh and people are nice they do a few things really well highly recommend .
im sorry to say this but the one i had was a little dry and not all that tender maybe its because its sliced thicker .
love the chicken tikka rolls consistently good its like an indian burrito but spicy also prices are reasonable only negative aspect is waiting in line during lunch but thats expected .
checked out both pats and genos not sure what the big deal is no flavor all i can say great tourist trap .
overwhelmed by tasty options bring on the heat very impressed by the one stuff with shrimp then again think i like em all .
pats and genos are both a waste of money theres nothing special about a guy putting an unseasoned overcooked and overpriced piece of meat on a roll and tossing it in the customers  .
delicious lunch of chicken tikka roll and aloo potato roll get here before 1215 to beat the crowd .
definitely not the best ive had neither was genos it was exciting just to experience an authentic philly cheesesteak .
somehow the rolls at this location tasted better than the same ones we had at  weird good stuff love the healthier whole wheat roti option achari aloo is my fave .
the service sucks the guy that took my order the past 2 times acted like he was too good for anyone the meat isnt good the bread isnt good the cheese is okay the fries were hard people only eat here for the name .
scott the manager was needed to spice things up with the service to the already spicy rolls good job .
pats is a rite of  get it over with so you can really go ahead and have some cheesesteaks elsewhere .
so good and open late i love every kati roll ive ever tried here my only complaint is that sometimes the onions are too thick and overwhelming .
if you are a tourist and are looking for a good cheesesteak do not go here it is a tourist trap and cheesesteaks they hand out are subpar save yourself some time and go somewhere else .
great atmosphere with quick service food was very good at the price well seasoned and the aloo masala roll had a nice heat that came after you were able to taste the rest of your bite .
extremely disappointed the only reason i gave it another star was that its across the street  genos was worse .
my second trip here and its even better scott the manager stopped by and talked with us about the store and made us feel welcome the rolls are top notch .
please dont plan your entire visit to philly around the cheesesteak debate you will be sadly disappointed when you sink your teeth into one of these sandwiches the cheese whiz addition was pretty fun but the sandwich is basic and the customer service is nonexistent .
this place is awesome went there for the first time this winter the kati rolls are filled with flavor the only drawback is there isnt enough seating we had to wait 15 mins to get seats .
the question of all questions pats or genos and the answer they both suck .
fantastic rolls so flavorful and perfect spices i tried all the rolls and chicken tikka and achari  were best and unda roll came a close second  is good too great place to grab a quick bite .
completely overrated and overpriced 8 00 for a greasy steak with tough meat the cheese wasnt bad and at least the fries were crispy definitely not coming back here especially when a food truck can deliver a much better sandwich for half the price .
kati rolls are great and wide selections i get their beef kati roll and aloo kati roll are some of my favorite and for nyc the price is reasonable .
marginally better than genos across the street thanks to the use of real cheese not whiz it too really is out of the way and overcharges on its tiny steaks go elsewhere .
we had the shami kebab chicken tikka roll and unda aldo roll as well as mango lassi it was delicious only 56 per portion portions are not big delicious definitely coming back .
overpriced garbage genos are better but not by much they both suck chinks steaks on  avenue is still the best cheese steak in philly .
its so good thats all eat here .
better than the genos option for tourists i suppose .
love it i ordered the chickpeas one and the standard one forgot the name of it the standard was pretty spicy for my taste i loved the chickpeas and i had the chicken one before also super yummy cant wait to go back .
pats steaks blows go to steves or chinks steak hoagie or  if u want a cheesesteak pats is a  tourist trap that lacks taste and a quailty roll place sucks a bag of ds .
so good the salad was good the beef and chicken rolls were good .
the most overrated cheesesteak place in philly do you like dog meat do you like attitude with your dog meat then go to pats .
must try absolutely delicious i had the chicken unda and the panner roll i felt one roll was enough a little heavy loved the pickled red onions in side the roll and recommend getting the green chutney its not spicy .
the second stop famous supposedly it was the first one they prepare your cheesesteak really fast the meat is dry their hot sauce is good its not as salty as sonnys but dry meat .
to my experience the best of the kati roll  locations take on the egg and the new shrimp roll an absolute oasis in the desert that is the midtown lunch scene k .
went to pats liked  better i was behind a guy who screwed up his order so i got the  attitude and  a substandard sandwich not enough meat stale bread  .
great place for a quick bite for  results get the unda chicken roll and see if this will up the spice factor for you .
as overhyped and bland as a tourist trap can get all the grease price and wait without the flavor character nor experience ive had way more tasty cheesesteaks with  at random nyc diners than pats .
their paneer rolls are to die for would make a trip to the city just for them .
this was perhaps the worst cheese steak i have ever had the flavor was awful my wife and i both threw our sandwiches out after a couple of bites .
indian food rolled up yummy and unique .
super dirty the  love it .
anything with eggs taste awesome here .
poor service food was middling at best and we saw mice squeeze in through  around the back of the building first and last visit .
my 3rd time here and gets better everytime i really enjoy the  masala roll with mint chutney on the side very nice and clean i just wish they delivered .
disappointing it was blend and the bread was hard the guy that took my order had an attitude i should have punched him in his big mouth .
i dig it .
terrible terrible terrible bad service not that i was expecting top notch horrible cheesesteaks yuck and is no comparison to tony lukes nuff said .
nice place simple menu love the aloo roll and the chana roll the paneer achari was good too but a little bland to my taste now i know where to get a satisfying lunch around office .
a man made me a steak sandwich without wearing gloves or washing my hands after handling money it was fine but unsanitary a small sandwich for the price id prefer genos because it wasnt an old register hand .
why is this place not a chain i would love it here in jersey .
wow the hype kills the experience bread was dry and the meat was blah great steak at the mall tastes so much better the cheese fries at least made this two stars .
perfect lunch spot or for a quick bite i had the unda chicken roll and it was delicious .
awful the steak was greasy grizzly and flavorless the woman who took our order was a pushy bitch the place was filthy it has gone significantly downhill since we were here two years ago with so many great steak places in philly i doubt well be back .
many times ive enjoyed this midtown spot for lunch when the office their prices are reasonable and the kati is excellent i cant even recommend something specific here because everything is delicious .
do not waste your time i had one bread tasted like paper meat like rubber the ketchup was good though pats gives philly cheesesteaks a bad name .
delicious these rolls are such a good idea and they taste great if i were to give a small  my husband thought they were a little dry so maybe a delicious sauce in the rolls would top it off .
honestly i dont see what the big deal is about the cheesesteaks in philly i guess when your city is a god damn toilet you have to find something to brag about .
i love carbs i love meat you cant go wrong here simple but great concept i kind of wish they had a food truck as well since delivery doesnt reach my apartment price could be a tad cheaper but still yummy .
ishkabibbles eatery is where you need to go tourists do yourself a favor enjoy fun eclectic shopping before or after the best most hearty fresh cheesesteak in philly the link below will bring you to the rest of my thoughts info about ishkabibbles yelp  .
this place never disappoints amazing food and very quick service .
i wish i could throw up on the screen and post that instead .
amazing i always heard of this place from my friends it is a definitely a musttry place in new york definitely spicy but really good the prices are high considering there is not nice decor in the area .
i cant believe ive not written a review about pats pats is worlds better than genos now  as though genos is crap thats not saying all that much i get friendlier service at pats the steaks arent cold and its a more inviting atmosphere .
i can already tell this will be my weekly treat between scheduled  the shami unda roll is divine and the chai is good theyre pretty helpful about telling you spice levels for the various options cant wait to try them all .
ew i got a wiz with and it was terrible the roll wasnt toasted and actually cold and stale the meat was full of gristle and the  wiz was lukewarm and thick it was overpriced garbage dont go here .
aloo masala make it two for 8 25 and youve got a lunch and then some vegan delicious outstanding spice man i love this place highly recommended cheers .
awful food served with an equally awful attitude mine ended up in the bin after a couple of  i dont get how this dirty little place ever got on the tourist trail dont be a sheep go give your  cash to somewhere that cares .
very tasty wraps and the ones we tried one with egg and one with potatoes were not spicy it was also interesting to see them making the rolls and the chicken and beef .
pretty damn weak for whats supposed to be the mother of all steak sandwich its a truck stop with more efficient ordering system dont waste your time here .
best  idea ever i cant wait to go back i had the mixed veggies and chicken tikka rolls and they were perfect .
pats sucks so does genos if you want a good steak any lunch cart is better or try the ethiopian cheese steak at  in on baltimore ave .
craving quick indian lunch near bryant park head to this spot quick rolls of meat chicken veggies shrimp wrapped in indian bread with onions and spices .
dont bother go down a few blocks so cosmis pats is nasty greasy and dont give you a lot of value for your dollar read little meat also the sweaty guys  the meat onto the girl really dont do it for me .
had the chicken tikka rolls i think you need two to be full delicious .
ah the line even though everyone told me not to try it i had to check it out  oooo lights across the street let me see .
im giving the shrimp roll five stars and this place gets an overall four stars because i thought everything else was good but not amazing .
better than genos but still just an overpriced tourist trap you can get a better steak at most pizza joints and lunch carts .
one word delicious their chicken tikka rolls and achari paneer rolls are the best authentic and delicious the food is cheap and tastes best when eaten hot and right away a must try .
a little bit better than genos but still sucks .
best in us definitely worth it .
being an out of towner i wanted to try a famous philly cheesesteak i didnt know i had to order one in the local  got whiz wit it was ok kinda small for the price i think ive had better in nyc .
love the roll .
absolutely horrible i do not recommend this place at all theres gotta be much better cheesesteaks .
good chicken tikka roll paneer tikka roll was good too its a great place for a light meal or snack flavorful and good but not great enough to deserve 5 stars .
pats gets one more star than the notorious genos because its slightly less xenophobic and the owner isnt as much of an ass  otherwise see my review for genos and youll get the idea .
very tasty there was a line out the door for the lunch crush i dined in and still was out the door in 30 min .
completely underwhelmed .
great place and awesome kati rolls went there on a sunday i ordered 3 rolls and was out the door in less than 5 minutes big flavors small prices .
i dont like pats or genos but anything taste good when im loaded at 3am and then i would have to choose genos pats steaks taste like shoe leather .
the taste to price  is very very high for this restaurant the   theme is pretty cool even though the place is run by  not indians the service staff is quiet grumpy even by nyc standards .
gross dude ive managed to avoid any  with e  thus far and id love to keep it that way that said ill stay across the street where i can see whats going into my cheese fries thanks .
any shami roll you eat here tastes pretty awesome because of its flavor there is not much seating here so best take your roll to go .
when it comes down to pats and genos i always just go to the place with the shorter line im going to drop pats rating a point because they usually have the longer line .
two thumbs up for a great indian style fast food joint perfectly spiced and seasoned the wrap paratha was a bit greasy but was quite satisfying .
dear dickhead behind the counter since this is a major tourist attraction youd think the  taking orders would realize we out of towners dont know the proper ordering lingo wiz with mushrooms with with without blah blah blah etc not that good .
love this place always excellent and fresh not giving it 5 stars because the wait is often ridiculous and you dont want to dine in always order to go and hike over to bryant park way better .
the only thing worst that a genos cheese steak is a pats one i just can understand why people make such a big deal about them other than local rivalry .
easily the best kati roll in nyc having landed from india couple of weeks ago and the chana masala roll is as good as the one you would get in india great job in keeping the taste as authentic as possible .
if i could figure out how to give zero stars i would slow mediocre food how does this place have 4 stars wish we had tried the indian place down the street .
indian food wrapped burrito style is a product of american fast food  that i hope will  the  of its feet .
disappointing  restaurant in olde city the  kabob chicken beef and lamb was served on a large platter that was  rice and a few small pieces of meat the meat wasnt good the service was very slow cant think of any reason to come back here .
can not go wrong with them eat all varieties to find your favorite .
dinner started off great with a nice cozy atmosphere and some tasty  but things went downhill quickly after that i had the lamb  which was bland and left much to be desired overall it was pretty disappointing .
looking for a good fast indian place this is it really love this place 8 unda chicken roll is the best its worth the price and the lines always out the door take my word and try it out .
tasteless and overpriced all around dont forget the waiter and his attitude maybe we ordered the wrong thing and the lamb hummus baba  and salad are just their bad dishes idk very very meh .
just one word for this place awesome .
disgusting they had cockroaches and rats droppings coming from the basement i went there to eat with a friend and it was disgusting when i saw the cockroaches there was rat poo and decided not to eat and left .
delicious maybe not the kindest service but the food  for it .
these people are messed up racists they will add a gratuity to your check if youre a person of color and  it if youre white dont patronize them they suck there is plenty of good food in brooklyn without giving money and business to racist  .
a great spot after a late night out i only had one vegetarian kati roll but my friend who took me there insisted on getting two absolutely delicious and im already a big fan .
this is probably the worst middle eastern food ive ever tasted yes the food was fresh and waiters were nice but the good was totally blend we ordered 4 dishes and salads and everything tasted exactly the same there was no flavor at all .
awesome rolls i had 8 chicken with egg just enough spice but not too much .
the chicken was amazing i was disappointed when my friend and i were refused entry into their outdoor eating area after ordering our food they said it was table service if you want to play that card you better get your wait staff ready to explain your policy .
visited twice and was not disappointed achari paneer ftw .
ive been ordering food here happily for over 20 years theyve recently changed staff its a change for the worse the food is not nearly as good the staff now is rude and extremely unpleasant tonight was the last time i go there too bad .
i went to grad school in this neighborhood and never knew kati roll existed such a shame so many lost  experiencing total satisfaction the vegetarian potato roll rocked my world .
they fry the falafel once in the morning and microwave it during the day chicken tasted weird definitely not middle eastern or mediterranean also tables were not clean would not come back .
very yummy especially 7 chicken tikka roll if u like shrimp try 13 shrimp masala roll .
i ordered the fallafel sandwich and was greatly disappointed as it had very little flavor i also ordered the bean salad which was not so great the only great part about this place is the bread which is pretty good .
really nice decor food is way cheap and delish i just really enjoy it number 7 and 11 are the  .
went there a few days ago for dinner what a disappointment i ordered  and it was so overcooked and chewy my wife ordered chicken and pasta marsala same  pasta cooked for probably 20 minutes just disgusting stay away .
good food with the right amount of heat for the price it cant be beat .
expensive and irrelevant aside from  and  together in one place .
this is a great lunch spot in the midtown area the food is delicious the service is quick and there is quite a wide selection also a great place to bring any coworkers that need a vegetarian option as well .
 against vegetarians the only vegan item on the menu is smaller than the meat ramen and it is significantly more expensive popular items are gone so it is a big disappointment after a half an hour wait not worth it .
cheap filling spicy food in a  atmosphere and always a good sign when an ethnic eatery in manhattan has several patrons of that same  i only wish that there was one in my nabe .
not the real thing even the hong kong shop was better no  tasteless pork disappointing .
big fan ordered for delivery with a couple of coworkers and we all enjoyed it very much very warm and filling and it is a roti wrap i recommend the paneer and the chana masala roll .
not as i respect the noodles dont taste that good .
aloo masala hit the spot perfect walking food .
meh ive had better elsewhere in the city the broth in my   classic was bland and underwhelming for all the hype its definitely overrated and definitely not worth the wait .
oh my goodness bless you kati roll for you being open late night to satisfy cravings in the early morning hours spicy kick to keep me  and going through the night for all of this and more you deserve four stars .
 terrible experience from the hostess giving inaccurate wait times to the waitstaff pulling food out of our partys hands while the food was being consumed to being yelled at by the manager overpriced lesser cuts of meat and no broth never again .
excellent kati rolls the meats are moist and flavorful and they offer whole wheat roti i like these more than the cart nearby but with that said this place is more expensive you get what you pay for .
i waited for about an hour to get in and ordered classic ramen the second modern ramen with pork buns ramen was good but not worth for the money 15 and time that i waited for i prefer totto ramen .
oh my good god the chicken tikka roll is divine this place is no  no fuss great food and hits the spot im a repeat repeat customer .
horrendous wait and management of the wait i cant speak about the food very informed because after 1 5 hours of waiting we were so  that anything tasted good .
stopped in here around midnight after seeing a show and it was the perfect quick bite we both had the chana masala roll extremely tasty quick service affordable prices a fun crowd highly recommend .
loved it a couple months ago but it has become way too trendy horrible rude service especially by a waiter named  they charge more for hot sake than  absurd .
i like this location better than the one in west village tasty and reasonably priced indian fast food a lovely treat .
absolute waste of time after a 2 hour wait the restaurant ran out of all vegan and vegetarian options never again .
 them a star since the  down on  and  has set the new bar for kati rolls in 2011 .
it is annoying when a restaurant merely tries to accommodate vegetarians the vegetarian ramen is basically like drinking a bottle of sesame seed oil with a few noodles some grains of brown rice and a few  and ends thrown in spare me .
positively addictive love this place the  masala is my new favorite .
terrible experience waited an hour and a half food was mediocre at best and saw a  roach crawling around .
ive only been for lunch the line gets long but moves fast their rolls are delicious try the shrimp masala .
maybe i need to go back again because i dont get this place ive got a few times but this   has never impressed with quality or prices i would lower expectations before checking this place out you might be disappointed .
i live a block away from this place and it really hits the spot they are consistantly good at making kati rolls the only complaint is that the rolls are too small .
not really a great diner in any way even the service is just meh the only great thing about this place is that its 24 hours .
 how i love kati roll if im ever in times square i always  so good so perfect great consistency and flavor all they way through the roll amazing the unda is my favorite if youre going def try that one .
wow thats really bad pizza .
sooo good a great find have had the egg less spicy than the others chicken tikka and yesterday tried the mixed veg with beets delish very cool concept .
empanadas were delicious but the grilled sirloin steak  a la  was really overcooked and dry not good for 18 just get the empanadas .
great food super quick and cheap a small quick eat kind of place that is always busy try the aloo and achari paneer rolls .
the service really bad very rude the food is kind of good and the natural juice is from a bottle .
achari paneer is awesome reminds me of home need three rolls to fill you up .
i dont care how good these empanadas are my office placed an order at noon and it is now  and we are still waiting for our delivery order .
cheap and delicious indian snack which feels like a meal if you have 2 rolls if you dont believe me then check it out for yourself my  is in the many indians that youll find eating at this fine establishment .
staff is really good friendly and attentive the food is less than stellar i dont see how people can call their food cheap you need at least 3 empanadas to feel full and the entree dishes are not cheap at all wouldnt recommend this place .
i came here by recommendation and tried achari paneer chana  unda chicken and unda beef everything was so yummy and the flat bread was just soo good i could eat this every day too bad they dont accept amex .
beware salty salty salty empanadas i perhaps had 5 refills of water tried the recommended empanadas brazil cuban spicy chicken chorizo viagra serve with a spicy red sauce creamy chimichurri service is fast and prices are cheap disappointed with the taste .
absolutely love this place the panner wrap is amazing i had it twice on my visit to nyc ive had many imitation kati rolls in the bay area but nothing compares to this place definitely a must visit if you are ever in new york .
the empanadas were great except for the fact that i got really serious food poisoning i had 1 chicken and 1 beef so it could have been either .
for a us indian fast food place excellent hit the spot get the chicken unda  .
okay food horrible service .
love the kati rolls here especially unda beef and unda chicken rolls although biryani cart has my favorite kati rolls the kati roll company is my second favorite and then have  which isnt an option when you purchase at the biryani cart .
no service did not get my food even though my friend did had to ask for a water refill 3 times .
oh heck yes this place is delish the chicken one was ok but take this with a grain of salt im not the biggest chicken fan but omg the achari paneer roll rocked my world so freakin good .
rudest people ever .
i love this place i usually get the chicken and egg roll but ive been wanting to try the others it can be a bit greasy so its not exactly the healthiest but its just so good i dont even care what its gonna do to my waistline .
plantain chips and guac 5 stars everything else meh sure the  are cheap but our tables were dry and didnt have enough flavor the arepas were probably some of the worst ive had the corn cake was fried to a crisp woof pretty disappointed .
man i think these rolls are made of crack had one been back here everyday the chicken rocks .
good empanadas horrible service .
this is an awesome place to get lunch good food real food not fast food junk and really cheap my coworker and i managed to get a table but im not sure thats often the case if you live or work nearby a great choice .
amazing empanadas but i will never ever go back because of the service im sorry but a  empanada service with attitude that sounds like an  of epic proportions go to  diner on 8th for far better food and   food service .
this place never seems to disappoint when i visit nyc my favorite rolls are the chicken and  the rolls are delicious and the prices are reasonable i always make sure to ask for extra chutney since it is a favorite of mine .
delivery also takes over an 1 hour its the closest place to my place to get empanada ive had much better but when i have a craving i have no choice .
just delicious i ordered the chicken and the potato roll both really good the potato roll reminded me of a home made mexican taco de papa oh lunch hour  busy there is literally a line outside of the restaurant so get there early or around 230 .
the service can we say terrible my friend and i waited over an hour for four freakin empanadas so we left that was just ridiculous .
yum i heard they were good but damn it really hit the spot i got the paneer roll  spicy good .
the empanadas were terrible super thick dough covering bits of spicy dry meat fruit shake was good decent service nice ambiance for a hole in the wall .
great  for lunch whether staying there or taking away its best to call the order ahead so you dont have to wait can be a decent wait during the lunch rush but completely worth it .
good empanadas horrible service .
this is our favorite place amazingly cheap even after being close to time square the food is very good we always have chicken unda roll or shami kabab roll and luv it .
heres why i have to encourage others to go elsewhere the empanadas were pretty good sadly the service turns you off completely the long sliced plantains with the guac was pretty impressive unfortunately its staffed with terrible employees .
brilliant rolls make u feel home away from home i always ask them to make spicy for which they add the freshly chopped green chilly and whoa its amazing great job kati roll company both locations in manhattan .
warm beer horrible service .
i dont even know how to describe this place its simply amazing and you should definitely go here dont even give it a second thought just go and you will be glad that you did .
i been here twice both times i had mussels the first time they were great this time they were full of sand i realize that they cant control the sand but the bread that was served was old too they do have a great selection of beers though .
can i say anything about kati roll co that has not been said before the rolls are greasy and good and they taste better at 3am after you have downed lots of alcohol the chicken tikka roll is to die for the achari paneer is pretty good too .
interesting bar with good beer but the mouse running across the floor was a turn off for me .
this place lived up to expectations once again and thus deserves another star  on its  .
beer was warm and food was well below par monks is a far better choice .
good and tasty show up before noon to beat the lunch crowd .
the beer selection is really good but thats about it the place has no atmosphere there was no music the two times ive been there i was on the verge of falling  .
just picked up two kati rolls and they were outstanding wife had the potato and i had the beef nice spice to it and service wa excellent abd quick great start to my evening food quest for great and quick food .
eulogy is a fantastic bar with an impressive selection of beers just dont try ordering anything other than beer from the snobs behind the bar they will make it perfectly clear that you are not welcome .
this is by far the best and only kati ive ever eaten the price is too high but my wife and i enjoy sharing the unda beef and unda chicken ask for it spicy .
i tried eulogy again against my better judgment expensive  service uninspired food should have gone somewhere else .
i love these rolls they make the best lunch i am definately coming back nice prices great flavor and so very addicting i think next time ill get 3 .
bottle selection is great but draught variety is somewhat tired service on a monday night was slow but ive had worse unfortunately the place ive had worse service was also eulogy .
very good food i had a shocking experience when i first tried indian food so my friend took me here to redeem my concept i cant recall what did i have but it was very good .
not going to spend much time writing this review go to monks on 16th and  more value and quality to be found at monks .
good food but the size of the kati rolls differ day to day i would like them if they would be more consistent .
i enjoy their beer but the service was lame i understand that servers get busy but they were not responsive forgot items and took forever worst of all the lamb made me throw up .
this place is like the new spoon  so damn satisfying ask for extra coriander chutney mmmm .
horrible food period .
i like the village bleecker location better the  tofu and chicken are surely better at bleecker though the  is amazing their kati rolls are cheaper but no where close to krc everyone including nonindians i have taken to this place have loved the krc rolls .
food is overpriced for the catering like quality mashed potatoes were more salt than potato we sent back the mac and cheese that had a  taste .
decent indian food at a   .
i had dinner here last night and would not return the service was slow the food was bland and there was this  dive bar smell to the restaurant .
great find right in midtown 2 tasty rolls my favs are lamb will make you very happy .
im giving jg a lower rating because they no longer offer the one great dessert they had on the menu beignets and when we  ordered one of the new desserts brownie they did not have any to provide really .
every time i come in from sf i usually stop here at least once the kati rolls are always very tasty .
this is not  best i find the menu rather limited i do like the flat breads .
hmmm yum .
i am a huge jg fan this is not one of his best the food came out to fast and the menu did not read well or explain the dishes properly i left hungry and i thought the meats and fish dishes for the portions were completely overpriced .
just go and try their awesome beef tikka roll the bestest indian burrito trust me you will thank me later loooove the vintage   posters priceless oozing sex appeal lol .
complete  zero loyalty to customers spending decent money in this establishment food is alright but people skills are zero for this place never again .
delicious kati rolls one is never enough .
small spot not many places to sit outside the bar is small too not a min for debit cards good happy hours 2  cream ale beers 5 mixed drinks and select wines small food menu not many veggie options .
they are spicy flavorful and delish the cons are the long lines at lunch and the  which i am not prepared to sacrifice for less flavor the one thing that i would add to their menu is a raita for dipping .
walked in for a drink and the bar was packed bartender was very rude so we walked out not a good idea to be rude to customers when there are so many other options around wont be returning .
great indian fastfood just a block from the ny public library and  for times square especially love the  paneer rolls service is friendly and seats usually open pretty quickly .
small spot good cocktails small portions .
yeah i can dig it  can get a little spicy for me .
review your credit card statement had a 80 57 bill wrote in 12 tip credit card charged 100 57 .
a staple craving for me while they started a trend and a lot of other kati roll joints have  up these guys are the first and best a favourite is the achari paneer roll .
was not impressed .
because of ordering it all the time at kati roll i can now say egg and potato in  you know just in case im ever asked to do so on a game show or i get  in india and i need to feed myself yum .
ramen bar is mediocre at best the food is consistently mediocre .
fast cheap indian what more can you ask for the portions are small yes but that just gives you an excuse to eat more then one .
food was decent but way too pricey further for a quick bowl of ramen the waitress completely forgot about my table and we had to wait 45 minutes i gave it a second try and the same thing happened not coming back here again .
this place is perfect for a late night snack their menu is simple with pictures to avoid any confusion their egg and chicken roll is yummy remember to get extra napkins because it gets messy .
ate here 3 months ago not good scallops and slaw going bad burger tasted like meatloaf on a stale roll drinks cleared before we were done left hungry because my plate went back full .
the food is exceptional loved the variety of the buffet the paneer is heavenly and they serve appetizers and several desserts .
service was too slow food was okay atmosphere was pretty good .
this is my favorite indian restaurant my wife and i love it the owner is extremely nice and it is never overcrowded .
food is hit or miss dont take anyone you are trying to impress with the meal the menu might sound incentive but execution can disappoint even with something simple like a salad .
consistently delicious friendly staff .
this restaurant is terrible full stop .
lunch buffet is great for trying new dishes and selecting your favorite the staff is very friendly and service is great .
just horrible service very uncomfortable hot restaurant and below average food for brunch .
forget about all the other places this is the best indian restaurant ever the service is excellent the food is excellent the owner is the coolest guy ever honestly there is nothing else to say this place is awesome .
ok the staff is a little pushy but the food was ok nothing that wowed me geronimos has better atmosphere and food if you seek spanish flare .
great combination and very flavorful surprisingly i didnt shit myself and the 10 00 buffet lasts till 230 definitely coming back loved it .
save your money overpriced mediocre food that lacks real flavor ceviche is fine if you enjoy tomato soup thin 13 guacamole is even more appalling rethink your choice .
great fresh and reasonable food i havent been here since they  the place but its comfortable and casual food is great and the home made breads are awesome .
bad drinks worse service bar tender rolled his eyes at me ive made the mistake of going back once and i wont make it again also since when does a mojito have sour mix in it fail .
 best indian food ive had in nj yet ordered lunch off the menu looked like most everyone else was there for the buffet chicken  was really good even the simple rice pilaf was good dal  very nice  pass kebab very good yum .
the jerk was ok nothing special all they do is make it spicy also the staff was snotty .
wow i dont live in nj anymore but i was home visiting family and my parents wanted to order in and i remember  being pretty good i ordered baingan bharta and it was amazing probably the best indian food ive had go and enjoy woo .
terrible smh .
this place the best indian buffet in this area great place to take friends and family to lunch or just a quick lunch on the cheap the food tastes great and the variety is also great .
its embarrassing how bad the service is at this place ill never be back slow rude not knowledgeable about the menu checked every box .
was looking for indian restaurant in the area and was delighted to find this one great atmosphere great food and service recommend .
terrible food decent service i did mention every time to my server and another worker that the food was eh ok and it was merely ignored no  as to why wouldnt come back .
i wanted to update to say this place is no longer byob which makes me a bit sad never had a bad meal here .
food sucks service sucks very disappointed there are so many better places to spend your money .
sometimes youre slow to get seated once you are seated the service is fast and great the food is always good an amazing mix of spices and flavors .
we ordered a 10 pizza which was essentially some cheese and crap thrown on a tortilla a big quinoa salad which had  that tasted pretty stale and some wings that were mediocre dessert was meh would probably not come back .
hands down the best indian food in north jersey always consistant and delicious food great vegetarian options too staff is always friendly .
great selection of beer at good prices and nice looking restaurant with decent ambiance that said after three dining experiences ill simply direct the reader to the first sentence of this review .
better than any indian restaurant in the area enjoyed the entrees we ordered  chicken tikka masala  gobi daal all great very friendly staff will return .
i was excited when i read about this place opening in queen village i am no longer excited after my experience this evening terrible food and bad attitudes .
i was very surprised to find that this establishment has found the perfect balance between spice and flavor i am definitely pleased .
 tolerable mall bar very regs atmosphere this neighborhood can do better  5 on the radio solid beer selection but overpriced too many beers in  glasses .
cant say enough good things food was delicious prices were reasonable place was clean friendly staff nice music i love it .
great food but the service is too slow .
slow service but really good food totally worth it got the chicken korma and asked for it to be spicy it was awesome will def go back .
bleh i felt like i was in a chain restaurant from the 90s mediocre food terrible music and decor .
i love this place byob and has a coupon in the entertainment book im craving chicken tikka masala as we speak .
service slow food sucked wouldnt go back .
caveat ive only been the buffet lunches given that i find the food to be wellprepared using notably all fresh ingredients they put on a little extra effort in the friday buffets so if you can choose a day thats the day to go .
nothing spectacular ordered old fashioned and it was sub par did not order food only drinks .
this place is very good they have a very good  selection that changes daily been going there for quite some time they have both vegetarian and meat dishes .
amazing atmosphere and delicious food even though way overpriced for what you get i had the arugula salad and added shrimp for 4 it came with three shrimp also my entire table enjoyed the cocktails but we were never offered a second drink odd .
fantastic  spicy the best ive had outside of los angeles .
service was sooooo unhelpful that we left without ordering not a good way to conduct business go to las bugambilias instead .
such a cozy and welcoming place outstanding customer service and very affordable in 2 hours i spent 15 including tip on 3 blue  and a delicious pretzel thats a steal if you ask any nyc resident definitely will come here again .
hadnt been here for awhile has gone downhill a bit tortilla soup was good steak needed salt impossible cake was awesome though  the quac and there were a lot of other apologies happening around the dining room credit card reader was broken food b but experience cc .
i love this place .
their reservation policy sucks ive been to this restaurant twice for a birthday dinner we made our reservations for 9 and we didnt get seated til 10 and their food especially the grouper with mango  .
came here for a graduation party and had a huge room with a dance floor the food was great our beer mugs and wine were constantly refilled i would love to come here just to grab a beer but i really enjoyed my time here .
granted i havent been here since 2006 but of maybe ten visits over the years i dont recall eating anything particularly tasty vegetarian options were slim and the sangria wasnt very good the nachos  were hilarious i hope thats still on the menu .
thai tacos are a must have they arent your average tacos obviously but man they are good the decor is cozy and the staff attentive good food for good price .
food was unspectacular and overpriced and left me throwing up the entire night .
best thai ive found in belleville and really in the states so far mamas food is awesome the vibe is relaxed and theres a liquor store next to it for byo .
subpar service is horrible chips are stale food lacks spice the space is nice if youre going for ambiance but dont expect much beyond fyi drinks are weak stick to  .
awesome place amazing food and great service food is yummy and served super hot its byob and theres a liquor store near by on friday nights it gets pretty crowded so just be patient the food is worth it .
nothing special pros the food is okay the space is large and accommodating cons it just isnt great nothing to rave about .
best thai food place in jersey the food was great but customer service needs bit more work if you go there you must try the thai tea im hooked i will be going back to topaz again soon .
the wine was bad and the portions were small disappointing .
first time and we r hooked this is now our favorite thai joint and we know thai mama the best and most gracious host we r starting   thank u mama .
pretty decent food but such bad service not just from one waitress but across the board .
 finally a thai restaurant close by that i love the pad thai was great and the side salad was a nice surprise not expensive either would recommend to anyone looking for authentic thai food .
horrible place ignored by waiter food was cold burger was raw salad dressing was bland and they were out of the good bread only good thing were the fries never coming back .
enjoyable in ways you didnt think food could be vegetables and tofu done right authentic creative and tasty place .
drinks are not bad but the food is subpar for nyc they messed up on order and food quality was ok i will come here again since so many more better choices prices are high in line with nyc but food is not i .
great food just not consistent still worth going there for some food with good flavors .
got brunch here place seems it would be much better than it is all food was average at best .
my all time favorite thai food place a very warm restaurant with a feel good ambience most weekends we end up dining here my favorite of all is their mushroom puffs n volcano crispy tofu their salad  are the best .
the food was good but wow the service was absolutely terrible we waited 20 minutes for someone to take our drinks order and they only did because we  them too .
still love this place now i know the super friendly woman is mama their pumpkin soup is amazing i cant wait for fall next year .
this place sucks the food needs work the mussels were plenty some type of tasty mac n cheese definitely needs more cheese only two stars for their decor sorry you just gotta try harder next time .
first time here with my fiancé and i must say that between the service and the food the place is amazing .
this place is great for business lunches fast service and somewhat ok food i would keep it simple order a sandwich and talk business food is not that great .
amazing staff delicious food and great atmosphere could do as a first date spot or a casual quiet dinner with your loved ones or friends will be returning there very soon .
dont order the skate did my bf wrong ill leave it at that .
good food and great service we will definitely come back esp for the soft shell crabs yummy .
one free dessert does not equal two mice and two mice in one night is not bueno thats right ya jerks two mice one night .
this is my new favorite thai place the thai coffee is out of this world everything weve ordered from here has been good friendly service and cute ambience .
i came here for brunch last year and it was really good came again a couple weeks ago and was really disappointed its still fine for an average brunch i just found the food to be way too salty they have interesting choices but the execution falls short .
great i  thai restaurants by their crispy duck salad ill be back for this one and to try the volcano chicken great service as well .
went here for drinks so i dont about the food the decor is great so is the atmosphere .
great kid friendly place the service is quick and the food is easily some of the best in jersey .
yuk worst chinese food i have ever had it was so so so salty unflavorful just terrible the sesame chicken was like chunks of dried  .
i love this restaurant wait staff is friendly and mama always makes you feel at home its cozy and inviting and the food is always delicious sometimes weekends are crowded so be sure to make a reservation and byob .
the last time we here was the worst service we ever have this petite lady is just the worst server ever the food still same its really good but service is getting soooooo bad the food still good .
i have been coming here since it opened and was struggling the food but more importantly momma and her wonderful personality has kept me coming back the best thai in north jersey bar none everything is exceptional prices are reasonable and byob makes it that much better .
service was slow meal was very good but then had to wait 20 minutes for waiter to bring out bill wife waited in the care with toddler and wanted to know why i did not come out we wont be back .
i love it when restaurants are welcoming and make you feel at home mama exceeds in this the seasonal pumpkin curry is great and you cant go wrong with the red curry my only complaint is the corking fee for wine that needs to go .
the worst service weve ever had first time ever and we are not planning on coming back food cost too much not even worth it really bad .
seriously this place is amazing curry pork special absurd mussels in lemongrass white wine broth best ive ever had please open a restaurant in jersey city mama .
i wasnt overly impressed i came here for lunch one day and ordered a vegetarian special it really wasnt very memorable the one thing i do recall is that the soup i ordered was so salty i thought my eyes would drop out .
nice casual thai restaurant pad thai was just right would go back reasonably priced decent food and quick service .
we ordered the lamb  fatty bits wasnt fresh and the kofta kebab made much earlier not even hot portions are tiny over priced considering the quality and quantity were not going back there .
the best thai around you simply wont find another place to beat the prices and hospitality that you get at mamas please try the thai tacos and the spicy basil noodles .
2 words very overpriced .
love this place the service is great the food is amazing try the thai tacos yummm .
screw this place its over priced for food that is not tha t good in quality they also treated the girls who worked there like slaves and like they were worthless do not go here moes is two doors down and so much more worth it .
fantastic thai best i have eaten anywhere in the world only 4 stars because the decor is a bit casual but food and service if 5 stars when i go i always order a few extra dishes to have the next day or two .
the chicken was coated in a terribly thick batter that was lacking both spice and salt the service was extremely slow even though only a few patrons were dining the only bright side of our meal was the mac and cheese which was delicious and a good portion .
highly recommend the fish tacos and the volcano chicken friendly staff and good prices usually there isnt a long wait for the food to come out but its been hit or miss .
way overrated i had the british breakfast and ordered with poached eggs the eggs had a strong taste of vinegar the sausages were cold the beans were also cold and the mushrooms were soggy i liked the bread however which was fresh and had a nice crust .
omg this is the best food i have ever had tell them i said hi i will be back .
slow slow service only 3 small groups and it still took an 1hr to get our food plus food was barely edible i wont be back .
mama will steer you right and runs a tight  the chili sauce is great on everything soft shell  in season we especially love the ribs and the chicken tacos .
terrible food stay away .
was here again and it was great again noodle dishes and green curry are very good green curry is very spicy yummy worth the trip .
the service was some of the worst service ive ever received in new york city the staff was condescending and rude .
tried the topaz fried rice this time and it did not disappoint me had the fried oreo with ice cream for dessert .
the place is great but somehow my credit card information was used after i left my card here a few hours too long so if you go here dont start a tab at the bar .
my family and i love this place they have great authentic thai food i love their tom yum soup and everything i eat there the prices are extremely reasonable and the people are very friendly we eat here at least once a week .
went in on sunday morning at 10  and it was empty door was open and nobody inside either side of the bar very odd was really looking forward to brunch here too .
totally loved loved loved the food great authentic flavors in the comfort if what feels like mamas dining room no frills just good fresh fair definitely will return .
a quiet cool atmosphere save a few  people by the front of the bar delicious cocktail note the  though because they unapologetically ran out of the ingredients for everything but that one damn tequila drink makes me think this place is poorly run and  named .
amazing place great food great prices great owner this place will never disappoint you the thai food is the best in new jersey .
please do not go here i was there with a party on the superbowl and was slipped  worst night of my life .
ordered out yesterday and had the chicken panang curry words cannot describe the awesomeness of that dish ive been going to topaz for the past 4 years never disappointed place is clean atmosphere is really friendly your always greeted with a smile and feel very much at home .
this restaurant is one of the reasons that i dislike chains burgers are greasy not juicy greasy decent salad bar not  decent will not be back .
i have to upgrade my review one of the other reviews said to go with the specials of the night i totally agree yum i am glad this place is nearby .
cant speak to the food but the service at the bar might be the slowest ive ever seen also 14 for makers mark is this a club left to go elsewhere .
came here for lunch with colleagues it was a quiet afternoon the service was good the thai tacos were great i also ordered the green curry with beef very delicious and spicy all in all it was a great meal would definitely come back and try some specials .
terrible service mediocre food over priced to name a few atmosphere was really the only positive thing i can take from this dining experience save your money dine elsewhere .
my favorite thai restaurant in nj cant go wrong with anything on the menu food is always spectacular service is usually good but can get a bit delayed when it gets busy suggest reservation on friday and saturday evening its byob so bring your favorite wine or beer .
pathetic do not go for the reasons mentioned in other reviews like horrible service and bad quality of food and drinks besides price is high for almost everything appearance can be  and this is perfect example .
great food great people this is a five star joint .
good food horrible horrible service the guy gave me a wrong order but was really rude about it service was extremely unprofessional i and future customers will greatly appreciate it if you improve on your service .
i was just there and had the duck which is there signature dish it was awsome the service was great and the other dishes we order were equally as good .
the food is ok but the delivery is constantly late it happened 3 times in 10 days and there was a one and half hour delay once .
topaz is hands down the best thai place i have been to in new jersey area i have been coming to this restaurant for years and tastes so authentic and very well priced i def recommend on trying this restaurant .
food was ok but not the meal my husband ordered atmosphere ok kids running back forth i guess waiting for food service slow not sure if well be back because i wasnt impressed .
delicious thai food the fried pound cake dessert was delicious our server mamas daughter was very attentive and friendly this place is an amazing value .
this place is the worst slow service rude staff just around a bad experience i will never k go back and i am staying at the hotel next door although it is convenient it is so sucks that i will avoid it at all cost .
topaz or once you get to know it moms has great dishes fresh ingredients and an  and friendly owner .
worst hibachi ive ever been to waited 1 hour before we walked never even got to give a drink order and it was a wednesday night to boot .
just had lunch there great environment and great lunch specials the best curry fried rice that i have had also very good pad see eww .
error with the check they forgot my wifes birthday at desert food was average hibachi chef was entertaining as usual hibachi chefs but wont go back .
this was my first time having thai food and it was very good the place is small but cozy and the service is very friendly they have definitely made a return customer out of me .
music way too loud service was alright at best food was ok .
outstanding flavorful food great friendly service an  delicious experience best thai food yet .
we sat outside on a beautiful sunday evening the restaurant was busy but not packed it took 30 mins to get a cocktail and the following food service was worse however the food was outstanding .
in the words of   mmmmmmm drool the food was definitely yummo the lunch portions are big enough that you will probably take some home the wait staff im told its mamas daughter is super  friendly will i be back oh hell bloody yes i will .
new owners and the food just tastes like any other run of the mill chinese restaurant hopefully this is just the break in  .
great french toast the whipped cream tasted deliciously homemade and the maple syrup was real pure maple syrup yummm my only complaint is that the portions were really small 2 small pieces of french toast for 12 it was so good that i wish they served more .
the splenda costs 20 cents a packet .
love this spot in our neighborhood sautéed kale is my favorite dish followed by griddle cakes with a side of turkey sausage the vibe is very friendly must try a glass of  wine .
tried to go here on a friday night at  and i was told they were closed even though their hours say 1130pm i probably wont try again .
simply perfection great staff delicious food especially the grits and frittata good environment the southerner .
two words  league service was slow and poor food was awful wouldnt recommend it and wont be going back .
the food is amazing the owner is very courteous brunch is my favorite but i also love the pies and smoothies being eating  food for years very healthy and filling highly recommend .
attempt here is to be a thinking persons olive garden wine list with few  is bottom shelf the bar is typical factory brands and cheap flavored vodka .
hands down the most genuinely nice people working there they were so passionate about their establishment and the food accompanied by it i had a breakfast burrito and my girlfriend had the gumbo soup with a sandwich everything was incredible cant wait to go back .
the environment is very bad and its so noisy that you have to speak aloud to make sure people sitting beside you can hear you and the  tomato in the main course smells weird .
great egg and cheese on croissant the place is classy but comfortable i would love to hang out here for a couple hours with a good book theyve got a full brunch menu plus juices and some alcohol the owner is very nice too .
rudest treatment i ever got from a host at a restaurant they need to hire a host with more manners and class .
good food like others have said but i was rather impressed with their grits perfect hard to find good grits kudos great staff attentive and shared the work load seems like a good team recommended .
worst penne a la vodka  feta cheese blocks .
what a wonderful place the food service and atmosphere were all top notch was able to talk to the owner and compliment her unbelievable biscuits and she is a sweet woman cant help but hope for her and this restaurant to succeed definitely get the grits and gravy .
if the owner was anyone but himself this place might have a chance .
yummy griddle cakes great service and the owner is very sweet will definitely be going back perfect for a quick brunch with friends or a drink while watching the world  sports game .
caesar salad was wilted with some brown lettuce pastas were good but light cream sauce is not light at all shrimp scampi was tasty bread ok pear and walnut salad quite good so mixed bag i thought pricey for the quality and quantity .
amazing pancakes and outstanding service i cannot wait to go back .
regular italian fare with signs but good atmosphere there is not much to say regular  regular chix par regular salad greens .
nice little coffee shop with wifi and the food is really good and the cook is a sweet heart if i lived closer i would go be there all the time to just relax and get something too eat before i go home im going back for sure .
pretty upset right now ordered the 17 and received smoked chicken instead of prosciutto i feel like you should know your menu before you make the sandwiches  as previous reviewers have stated the sandwiches arent paninis as they are served as is .
great ambience great food and very friendly wait staff their brunch menu is a bang for your buck .
taking your life into your own hands when you go there at night and its not because of the food .
excellent service and food the brunch menu has a good variety of choices everything i eat was very fresh .
it only got 2 stars because of the fish tank the pineapple fried rice had no taste what so ever the mongolian beef was just as bad the drinks were ok the place was kind of empty for a saturday night .
i went in here with a friend during saturday brunch we ordered the ham cheese croissant and sausage egg  both were excellent the staff was friendly and attentive a true gem in harlem chocolate lovers try their chocolate wine .
sitting here for 10 minutes and the place i empty no one has come over to the table so we are leaving and this place is on the never return list .
great wine and good service the owner was super friendly .
so im glad they close the raw food at the barbecue that we have to cook but they close the kitchen where they cook until 1130pm seriously .
just had my first brunch here and biscuits are quite possibly the best ive ever had with just a hint of cheddar and i chose the farmers skillet ill be back good crowd too .
horrible simply horrible overpriced and poor quality ive been 3 times and thought the same each time the best advice i can offer you is to stay far away from this place .
had a great brunch their this past sunday salmon cakes and the maple chicken sausage were outstanding prices are good too .
stay the heck away we walked out as the slobby bartender couldnt serve us because he and and his slobby friends couldnt stop talking about how long its been since theyd  its a classy joint and all the customers were very well dressed hoping for nice lounge .
delicious soups hearty sandwiches great variety of desserts served in a renovated space showing exposed brick walls pot  stove in a spacious comfortable setting eclectic art collection with with soothing music played is a relaxing fun venue for lunch in harlem near  we will return .
protip stay away from this horrible place seated at an awkward table in this tasteless restaurant service was incompetent no utensils .
this place is not bad 1 good japanese place in midtown that isnt too expensive surprisingly 2 got the soba good price for good quantity and good quality 3 friends got udon and they loved it too 4 its really cute inside bigger than i expected .
great atmosphere great decor and very nice bartender food looked great and portions were ok but it just didnt taste very good there is definitely better sushi out there .
katsu is very tasty as good as those i had in tokyo veggies soup and rice are  services are nice didnt plan to dine here and it totally exceeded my expectation .
bad sushi bland tasting bbq very disappointing .
i really liked their katsu i forgot which one i got but i thought it was great big portions too .
watered down soy sauce destroyed the mediocre taste of the sushi  watered down soy sauce with wasabi made a clear mix that tasted terrible place was very noisy reviews written here must be from his very large family .
comfort food for me .
i only give this place 2 starts because service is so bad had to wait 20 minutes for a table everyone runs around like their heads are chopped off with that said the sushi is really good and that is the only reason i put up with everything .
great katsu and curry the cabbage  out the fried foods the miso is good the array of sauces are enjoyable ive only been for lunch a few times and will continue to come .
the worst mexican food ive ever had in the burrito the chicken still had chicken skin and fat and no flavor the  were burned and gross the enchiladas didnt have much flavor the service was slow i really cant understand why this restaurant got good marks .
first and last meal in ny during my last trip out there the katsu is delicious .
ummmm 10 for pho are you kidding me retarded prices who charges 2 for a can soda outside of sports  .
i had been here  three days for the dinner when i was traveling nyc because of the meals were great and traditional and i love katsu don soba cabbage salad free refill however if you also travel nyc i would recommend this restaurant y y .
got their classic and chicken sandwich their portions were large the sandwich was unbalanced some bites were just spicy the best thing was the peanut sauce on the summer roll .
i love its miso soup and pork the pork was juicy and delicious and it keep  fashion of unlimited refill for soup rice and side dishes which is nice .
i went there for the bubble tea and wasnt impressed the  was soft and sweet but the tea had no flavor i ordered the  green tea and even asked for some more tea flavor because i didnt taste i still didnt taste it .
very thick katsu authentic japanese spot try loin its better than tenderloin miso soup bad good price .
park slope location really great food but they delivered to us last week and then tonight 45 minutes after ordering they call to tell us they wont deliver to us this is ridiculous and terrible business .
i tried their chicken katsu it was the best i have ever tasted its crispy and  in your mouth instantly dont know better words to describe you just have to try it .
the only reason i gave this place 2 stars is because of polish bartender inside was extremely hot staff claimed ac was on the mussels were the worst they only give you one piece of bread at a time better places out there .
wow what a treat for lunch the best miso soup ever loin and fillet was super not a fancy place and service is soso but great price here .
bad food for a high price choose another place there are plenty of other restaurants along the street .
the front gate is very small but when you get inside its a whole different world it very artistic very nice .
pros affordable place to have dinner place is romantic enough for a date located in the quiet part of soho cons food and service is mediocre .
the service is very nice the food is a different  food beyond  great try the katsu with curry or the katsu bon the menu looks pretty good too not that ill ever know i get cravings for katsu curry and thats what i get .
nice atmosphere and food and wine but waiter is not friendly but surly i would not come back here although the restaurants name is wine and flower i did not see flowers inside the restaurant but dead  .
best katsu i have ever had strongly recommend the  katsu because its  and more juicy the katsu dons and udon bowls are delicious as well one of my favorite places to eat in town .
tried to overcharge us for our mimosa pitcher nice try didnt have crab and the  of my eggs benedict was probably a 1 2 definitely will not be returning .
outstanding ramen a little on the pricey side .
maybe that was a bad evening but sorry i really did not like my experience there burnt bread the cheese plate was a joke chicken entree was not a chicken paillard but just sliced chicken with a burnt taste not impressed at all .
delicious donkatsu the  is especially tender with the right level of cooking .
come here for the drinks not for the food the drinks are strong and pretty great but the food unfortunately leaves a lot to desire from mexican i suggest sitting at the bar and ordering an interesting guac with some margaritas for the best experience .
very authentic place to get katsu and curry you can smell the curry the minute you walk in and its fabulous will definitely come back for more love their sesame dressing for the cabbage salad it is the same as the dish i had in asia .
overpriced guacamole weak margaritas and always a waiting time of 2 hours dont do it .
had the hire katsudon and it was great i liked that it wasnt overly fancy and just an old fashioned katsudon a bit pricey 14 but would go back if im in the area .
my two stars says it all ive experienced better our visit here was very meh we expected more from a place with such great reviews .
really like the katsu juicy tasty nice thin crunchy crust lovely little place near 5th ave the waitresses are busy so sometimes you may need to wait a little bit longer but all in all would love to go back again .
they get one star only because the drinks are good the service is bad the food is not authentic and the overall attitude is snobby for such a mediocre place why people come here i will never know .
really good food but lacks in customer service curry chicken was good and amounts were big had to ask for water and the check when we were obviously finished wasnt crowded and plenty of wait staff so not sure why .
this place is cool but so mismanaged i hate that it takes an hour just to get a seat a bit corny .
my kind of comfort food great katsu and their oyako donburi is as good as i remember that dish will order their curry katsu next time i am here .
the food was not good so what else can i say .
for katsu in usa i think it is as good as it gets .
i like the atmosphere of el vez but i think the food quality has gone down hill in the past few years in terms of mexican there are many other options in philly that arent as pricey the staffs great and they have nice outside seating .
outstanding worth the plane ticket from  to  cab to manhattan to eat here th tonkatsu options are stunning kurobuta of any size fried with housemade tonkatsu sauce or curry rice even the  is outstanding not kidding run dont walk there now .
decent food and drinks cannot make up for inexperienced grumpy uninviting staff this place is not for families or for those who value knowledgeable welcoming service with a smile .
nice cozy place staffs are very friendly .
overpriced garbage served in oversized bowls that are most appropriate for dogs to eat out which is what this food should be reserved for dogs .
hot damn fried japanese everything .
ive tried el vez a few times the first time i hated it a few months later i gave it another shot meh 3rd time was meh there wont be a fourth time because there are several other really good spots that i much prefer to el vez .
i dont eat a lot of japanese food so cant write a very critical review the service was great i was a little clueless about how to handle one of the dishes so the staff was happy to  me the food was very good .
it was just a so so place .
for those who do not eat pork this place still is worth a visit my standby dish from having lived in japan is oyako donburi and it is properly done here they recently  up the place so the overall experience is now even better .
the manager was the most  person i have dealt with in philly very disappointing for being a steven starr would not go back because of how our group was treated .
the katsu curry is amazing i go there often for workday lunches and i was never disappointed by their tonkatsu must try place .
 .
fav katsu curry in nyc .
the photobooth is cool atmosphere is weird and not welcoming and the drinks werent too great i am not a cocktail girl though so i should stop ordering cocktails .
authentic japanese donkatsu slightly pricey but thats japanese food for you the quality of the meat is excellent they give plenty of cabbage to chase down the grease its a solid four which i give it  which i encourage all yelpers do  ill be back .
good happy hour scene food meh .
pretty decent place cute and warm atmosphere .
food is ok service blows .
very authentic style tonkatsu japanese pork cutlet place there is also another one at 55th between 5th and 6th but this location is actually better in terms of food quality at least the last time i went .
the food was gross the carnitas tacos were dry and had no flavor the enchiladas were nasty the blood orange margaritas were great the guac was fine but nothing to write home about .
obsessed with this place cant wait to go back when its less hot out and the cold weather calls for the down home katsu curry go right at 12 as there usually isnt a wait .
came here twice and was disappointed both times the only thing i would order again here is the guac with jumbo lump crabmeat and thats all but there are so many other authentic mexican eats around philly id rather go to so no more el vez .
i wouldnt say its the best but its pretty solid ive gone a few times with my wife and her friends the food is always consistent there are better places for curry but its not bad here the tonkatsu is what i really go for anyway .
hated it service bad people bad food bad go somewhere else and everything was overpriced .
delicious katsu was in the neighborhood and decided to check this place out sat by the bar and was served immediately fast service good food lunch special was affordable and filling and left satisfied would love to try their donburi lunches next time .
pretty cool atmosphere but food portion laughable for price if its going to be meager portions it better be orgasmic good it wasnt it if i never go back i could live w it .
good quality japanese really 3 5 stars giving it four stars is for the unlimited miso soup with the lunch specials the katsu is perfectly cooked and i always leave full and satisfied .
the margaritas and guacamole were good i would not come here for an actual dinner ive been here twice and never left completely in love or impressed with anything i had .
make sure u order the pork katsu miso soup and cabbage are unlimited refill .
the food was so so and quite expensive flavorwise it is not the most authentic mexican restaurant in town its good for a casual date or drinks with friends more than a real culinary experience .
what a score excellent katsu juicy and delicious good value for a manhattan lunch spot and quick service this reminded me of the little hole in the wall japanese places in  ca id definitely recommend it .
horrible cheezy overcrowded overrated typical of this type of establishment .
have had katsu before but this is one of the best places in nyc ordered the prefixe chicken katsu dinner loved the katsu and the free refills of rice cabbage salad miso soup loved the sesame seeds and grinder will be back japanese sangria was a tasty bonus .
overpriced and with a  crowd that i find uninteresting el ray better suits me .
all their katsu .
overpriced mexican food served in a hip center city atmosphere no  with your order other than that its normal mexican food .
great quality and fair prices .
i like the location the drinks were okay but the service was slow it is always busy there so people like it the bar is way too close to the tables there so its very uncomfortable .
great service delicious food i loved the interactive eating too grinding my own sesame was fun .
i know so many people love el vez and ive only been once just dont understand what all the hype is all about the place looks nice the noise level is high and the food was ok maybe i was there on an off night .
 .
pretty good food and drinks but way overpriced .
i always liked this place cause it has katsu and a lot of different kind .
another overrated place food was overly  open table reservations wouldnt allow for a table reservation we sat at the bar there were at least 6 empty tables for our entire visit ridiculous and  later i feel cheated .
my first meeting with katsu i had the pork katsu with grated radish and ponzo sauce oroshi kurobuta loin katsu 24 i loved the miso soup the katsu and especially the  soy sauce ponzo sidenote i heard the place also had quite good vegan food .
the guacamole and the drinks are great the decor is fun but the food is terribly seasoned and the service is only soso the tacos were doused with so many seasonings i could barely tell what i was eating .
this is good solid japanese restaurant food was good service was good also .
overpriced underwhelming not the best of star restaurants .
love the fact that they are  in katsu dishes tried the lunch special combo which included curry udon love it so worth the price .
way too expensive and overrated if youre inclined to eat at a steven starr i recommend continental for happy hour .
always busy and always good had the  box limited number to be served special for 18 more food than i needed and everything fresh delicious and not oily  been coming here for over 5 years and never disappointed .
eh ok food and drinks .
best katsu don in ny pork cutlet is juicy .
on my last visit i noticed that one of their guacamole offerings is named for cesar chavez which is great because all cesar chavez wanted out of life is to have some guacamole named in his honor .
this place is awesome you know when the place is full of japanese people you are in the right spot the katsu is amazing the curry katsu is even better you can eat a ton here for dinner and not pay too much pitchers of beer too .
have a few drinks enjoy the vibe but skip the overpriced blah food i cant believe they even messed up churros i mean come on guys .
really delicious authentic japanese home cooking the pork and chicken katsu are really great .
long wait and slow service on a wednesday evening the worst fish tacos i have ever had good guacamole reason for two stars will i come back here no .
great affordable japanese food love the katsudon special there are multiple ones on offer as well as their appetizers definitely recommended .
the service was awful but the food was okay my boyfriend thought that the enchilada sauce tasted like chef boyardee i could see that it wasnt impressive by any means the presentation of the food was amazing but the taste was in the middle .
the katsu and the pork soup strongly recommend were awesome despite the fact that they made me wait for my check for quite a time .
i think my mistake with this place is that i always seem to go around happy  worst time ever to go the drinks are good and the food seems okay but everything here everything is waaay overpriced .
very nice katsudon and the takeaway counter had room for a stroller to boot .
not a fan hate the whole enviroment  like all starr spots expensive not for me .
holy delicious the katsu don was exquisite every bit as good as any time i had the dish in japan they lose a quarter star for not having sriracha but i cut em some  reasonably priced for the area too .
tried this place one more time to give them another shot never again this time was given raw chicken in my panini when i called to let them know not one person apologized really poor customer service an apology goes a long way .
best tonkatsu in ny so far but i never got good service here .
being from brooklyn this pizza is no way close of tasting anything like the slices in brooklyn for jersey i guess its ok not the best had worse .
decent place for some moderately priced katsu nice to have in the neighborhood .
ive been meaning to come to this place for a long time so i recently had the chance the pizza isnt awful its just reminiscent of frozen pizza from the supermarket not worth going at all .
great katsu make your own sesame sauce and get beer with the food so much better .
the pizza crust was bordering on cardboard territory mozzarella sticks were no better than frozen its a chain from florida or something has anyone ever been to florida their pizza is terrible stick to 100 other small pizza  in the area for something better .
delicious katsu the pork was especially good quick and friendly service highly recommend .
it is one of the worst pizza i tried out of brooklyn the pizza is greasy and wings are tasteless the best thing on the menu is the coke .
tonkatsu curry some of the best japanese comfort food ever food is absolutely delicious especially washed down with a cold beer gigantic portions at a decent price .
would not recommend their food is not fresh went here twice and both times got sick their sushi gave me gastroenteritis not something you want to go through .
best katsu place in nyc .
fussy and unsatisfying dishes entrees such as the lamb roast or squid are  by too many competing  sometimes a slice of cheese and apple are all you need .
an authentic eating experience had the chicken katsu not terribly awesome but the staff and interior were nice .
every yelp review  the rabbit yet it seems they have removed it from the menu as of at least september 2015 total letdown everything else was relatively overpriced and mediocre tasting throw in some snotty service and you get yourself a 2 star review .
i go here again and again when i travel to nyc delicious japanese katsu at a fair price ive had the pork and tried the chicken with curry sauce both were very delicious great cure for a hangover .
this place is a joke they sat us down and didnt take our order for 40 minutes they food we got was tiny and boring im posting the photo of their pastries plate that will say it better than words .
love this place for their tonkatsu the waitress was nice and they refilled my plate with cabbage miso soup and rice a few times with no extra charge the katsudon was good also .
the food is too damn small .
oh man the chicken katsu curry is freakin awesome make sure to put the hot spices in there as it really adds a good kick to the dish .
quality of food is high what they serve is tasteful and drink selection is vast but its a stretch of the term to call this a tapas bar unless bar takes priority dont come here expecting calories to come from food  80 of the menu us alcohol .
had their kurobuta katsudon very good i saw someone having a katsu curry that looked really good must return before i leave ny in a few days .
what happened to you when you first opened you were fantastic i went back today and i was sooooooooo disappointed food didnt look fresh empanadas lacked filling and the filling was horrible im so upset at this place it had huge potential but instead fell off .
katsuhama offers pretty reliable authentic katsu dishes for when you want katsu i like how they provide the  and mortar for your freshly ground sesame seed needs as well as a heaping mound of chopped cabbage just like mom would serve you .
it was cheap guess you get what you pay for gave me the worst diarrhea of my life think i rather pay more and go to one of the better chinese restaurants in wayne for dinner from now on .
15 dollars for a pitcher is not bad near times square i got the katsu and it was the best i have had outside of so cal the prices were affordable by nyc standards if i stay around the area i will def be back .
awful first portion is sad almost 5 00 for a flavorless mac and cheese come on the portion was smaller than what you get in the kraft microwave cups spent over 10 00 and could have gone to 10 other places and got twice the food .
brilliant katsu set with the works and some tempura as well this place is midpriced but well worth every cent as the katsu is done just right and the curry sauce is not too salty .
was not impressed we had one back home in the midwest that was much better out of our 3 meals only the kids mac and cheese was good the other 2 were dry dry dry .
love the pork curry with unlimited cabbage salad something about it makes it crave it over and over again yum yum and cheap .
we had the pork feast and most of the dishes were too greasy and overly salty the bacon  and  icecream was delicious .
best tonkatsu i cant find anything like it in los angeles .
very disappointing menu choices and quality definitely did not live up to all the hype i would not return perhaps the people who love it have never had any other french country cuisine .
i am a big fan of this place for lunch and for a casual dinner they know how to fry pork i also enjoy the presentation of the cabbage and sauces the curry is great perfect comfort food for a cold day .
terrible service the hostess was extremely rude and our party of 9 ended up walking out .
i just love this place usually dinner time is pack i recommend that make reservation before you go .
terrible service people very upset with everything when we asked for seating for nine hosts response was well thats ambitious no manager on site and twenty open tables poor planning on their end .
tonkatsu one of my favorite dishes this katsuhama is great because it has sets unlike the one at 55th st or whatever i dont know where else has better katsu in nyc i wish there were though because the level is definitely higher in asia for katsu .
very interesting and unique experience the restaurant has a   theme going on and i dont know if thats a good thing or bad thing the food was mediocre at best .
katsu curry was awesome and strangely refreshing add some cold   and youre set .
our dinner took way too long to arrive the people sitting at the next table arrived after us and got their food before us we ordered the lamb which was very tasty and the paleo zucchini pasta which unfortunately was very bland probably will not come back again .
the donkatsu lunch special is awesome good portion definitely left feeling satisfied you get your own sesame seeds to grind in a bowl to mix with the sauce very authentic for 11 a great deal dont go for the decor or service .
meh as in mediocre overpriced for  but i guess theyre  when the second avenue subway is up and running which will drive up prices all round .
good katsu japanese style pork cutlet its the same good katsu you can get in japan .
pretty pricey for a lamb kebob pita at 9 50 no seasoning zero flavor had the lamb kebob platter too rice is good but everything really just lacks that special spice and tangy flavor found in this cuisine meh tried them twice doubt there will be a third .
homemade tonkatsu sauce perfect panko perfectly fried not greasy just crispy best tonkatsu i have ever had .
nooo  discontinued the  salad and replaced it with some other version with beets and a vinaigrette that was by far the best thing on the menu really hope they bring it back .
this is place is really good the curry chicken katsu was really yummy miso soup was so so .
i ordered the pull pork and while i was having my first bite i saw a roach on the wall how is this place open so unsanitary disgusting never coming back .
almost like being in japan except for the service staff food is excellent .
 i dont rate foods on authenticity unfortunately i still wouldnt recommend this restaurant to anyone in the  or elsewhere .
very good and authentic japanese food the katsu is delicious they bring extra rice miso soup cabbage small restaurant but fun to be at .
what terrible service the lady manning the phone is so rude unbelievable they are so late and give you attitude when you ask why the food hasnt arrived 145 hours later .
my favorite tonkatsu place in the city especially with oroshi and the yummy non stop salad they make their own tonkatsu sauce with green apples in it  .
halal food truck quality food but half the size and double the price nice interior but no serves nor friendly smile .
of the oddly high amount of asian restaurants in the area this is one of the best the chinese is above average and the sushi is better than expected not mindblowing but good enough and the delivery aspect doesnt hurt in the least .
a place known for its breakfast sandwiches doesnt open until 900 am not even 830 doesnt make sense this would be a 4 or 5 star review otherwise .
the food is absolutely delicious i ordered the orange chicken and it was amazing after coming to  i havent gone to any other restaurant for chinese food the taste is authentic and the service is great .
the arm hair i assume arm hair otherwise it would be much more  was not the sort of garnish i was expecting at least that explains why it took them so long to prepare .
i can describe  in one word excellent and the staff could not be nicer the only bad thing is parking i wish they would move to another area in lyndhurst the lack of parking has to effect their business .
not good experience i have just got a simple salad and a calamari and the veggie seemed not to be  and healthy at all if this should represent the italian food  i am not proud to be italian .
love this place the sandwiches are phenomenal the pasta salad is to die for theres always the two guys that work there and they are very nice i would highly recommend .
wonderful food worst waiter ever totally ignored us once he took our order acted like he did us a big favor noticed lots of  between him and the lovely waitress who would have made our experience a keeper he needs to go .
delicious inexpensive and quick service deli italian sub was  street parking  one star and would have been nice to have a chair or two so i didnt have to enjoy that sandwich in my car but otherwise absolutely no complaints .
this restaurant gave me food poisoning spinach lasagna will never go back avoid .
excellent they make a sub so good u think about the next one u will order the store is very clean and smells good .
i waited 10 years before giving chilis a second try i think ill wait another 10 years before another the steak was soso and the mashed potatoes tasted like cold wall paper paste .
i love this place i have gone almost every friday because i work in lyndhurst on fridays i have not had anything that is bad this guys are awesome and so accepting and will make anything you want .
too expensive for what it is the 17 vegetable risotto is made from those frozen vegetables in a bag  carrots peas etc with no fresh vegetables at all small portions too disappointing .
must stop here fresh mozzarella made at least 3x a day sandwiches big enough for 2 everything is fresh and reasonably priced my boyfriend lives 2 blocks away and i am no longer upset he moved from ct .
i wanted to like this place but it is just terrible dont waste your time or your money .
the best italian deli around staff is great food is even better .
i cant quite figure out why people go to this place overpriced stingy portions lousy service so so food etc nearby dosai place or  is so much better .
this is the best italian deli i think i have ever been too the owner and staf are super friendly and even gave me some free garlic bread everything i have had from there is incredible the mozzarella is great and the  are top notch .
bummer food okay to meh everything everything is fried nothing is filling or feels healthy service not great no ice on the premises for your water cheap but you get what you pay for never again .
some of the best  in town really like the meatball pam .
horrible food and service asked for a crispy dosa it was anything but crispy the dosai place down the road is much better they also got the check wrong .
my favorite pizza joint cash only huge portions and worth every penny my husband and i have been coming here since we were kids the best .
uncooked paneer appetizers biryani white rice mixed into older biryani masala trying to cover up stale food into too much spice im so glad we have other options in  now .
love joes great pie nice service .
really bad i could taste nothing but the  plus my order was mixed up nothing to recommend other than the price .
the tiramisu and espresso were on point also the bartender and  were really generous about letting us grab dessert right when they were about to close cant wait to eat an entire dinner always packed on the weekend make sure to make a reservation and bring cash .
a small portion of chicken biryani for 12 what a ripoff the paradise outlets at other locations including edison and jersey city offer much bigger portions and better value for money .
my husband and i usually get take out from here once a month the kale salad is delicious and sometimes at night i dream of the sage gnocchi .
service very disappointing with long waits and indifferent attention .
great food and great service .
just so so wanna simple much during weekend its can be considered but never worth for line up .
love this place the food is consistently good the fish special is usually my go to the calamari is always pleasing too this place is super intimate which i love when the weather permits its also a nice place to grab a bite outside .
multiple friends have been to this restaurant but totally do not recommend here for the same reason the service was not good but request more than 18 tip for parties of two kind of humiliating customer .
cant fault this spot get the tiramisu got the lamb tagliatelle green salad calamari fritters and tiramisu cozy and close to home .
food is ok they pay too much attention on the tips i gave them 18 for dinner and they are not satisfied with that want me to pay more tips i wont go there anymore .
i love this place great fresh food homemade pasta i cant even list my favorite because i love them all the staff is so nice and it goes well with the awesome food i know i repeat myself but the food really is great .
i dont think it is a good place to go cant even find food to make us full .
the only downside to this place is that it is cash only truly amazing lamb tagliatelle great calamari with delicious spicy marinara sauce great house wines and everything is an amazing value especially for nyc the restaurant is very cute has great lighting and an outdoor dining option .
we came here for lunch the other day and got premium beef shabu lunch special very standard beef and sauce nothing special pricey for such mediocre lunch special .
you simply cant do better at this price range great ambiance too .
maybe we all ordered the wrong thing but the beef  was nothing special at all .
the  were warm and comforting the pasta too was  perfect and the wine selection was ideal for a menu this size and price range its a wonderful neighborhood staple to enjoying a night out whether or not it is a special occasion .
the food was okay but was brought down by the terrible service i had im sure others had better experience but i didnt 2 stars .
great local restaurant good price human sized portions their carbonara was fantastic but unfortunately is no longer featured on the menu they do have it sometimes as a special friendly service cash only wish they had  on the menu hope they check their yelp .
definitely over priced and over rated ive had much better shabu once is  for me .
overall a good experience the food was tasty if a bit heavy for summer staff was friendly i just wish the decoration was a little fresher but thats just me being  .
over over overpriced totally no idea why this place is rated so high on yelp and the hot sauce is actually pretty sweet even the chili powder u call that spicy even red brick powder is spicier .
the food here is very good great portions at a very reasonable price service is lacking but understandable in such a small dining space great addition to the neighborhood a must .
although the food looks good i am bummed this place has a two order minimum i am a shabu fan but it doesnt work for single travelers .
great food wine and service it is cash only but it wont break the bank its pretty tiny so you may want to call ahead and make a reservation because it fills up fast .
this was my first experience with shabu shabu it was ok not something that i would try again the waitstaff was very attentive and very  in explaining the process to me .
during our visit to brooklyn we discovered this place because of yelp we sat outside on a lovely summer night and had the best food im a fan of any place where i can get glutenfree pasta .
worse  d spot ive encountered service was great but food lacked any quality i got the buffalo chicken sandwich the chicken was really thin and very dry i subbed out onion rings for fries good choice girls watch out my girlfriend said the bathroom was horrible .
awesome value the chef is incredible generous with portions and even offer delivery i frequent as much as i can .
someone please tell me how this place ended up on ddd i cant think of one good thing to say about this place i had chipped beef on toast and got a couple of slices of corned beef in a bowl of cream soup .
cute lil place around the corner from my house mussels is a must try fresh pasta and the service is always great .
nice enough place really nothing special though at least at breakfast inexpensive bland bagel for an upcharge at breakfast was awful however there is no excuse for bad bagels in this part of the country .
i live just down the street and have been here around 6 or 7 times already it is pretty damn good and ridiculously cheap the specials are actually special lamb ragu branzino wild boar ragu spinach  with peas and prosciutto amazing .
here is a review of their reservation process bad experience i guess the rude behavior  beyond those who eat there please tell your folks to be more polite on the phone even if you dont have an available  no need to be rude about it thanks .
great the prices are amazing and the food delicious our waiter was friendly and attentive i loved the shaved brussels sprout salad i would definitely go here again .
the place is nice specially in the summer the music is good but the service is terrible the bartenders take at least 15 minutes before they even acknowledge you specially if you are a female you will have no luck with getting a drink horrible service .
enjoyed it a lot very personal service great food nice neighborhood joint .
first time there will never return not a place i would recommend to anyone service and parking fees not good lil blonde girl behind bar needs to go back to bartender school .
neighborhood gem insanely high quality food for the price great service its still  until they get their liquor license .
this place was not very clean inside and the waitress was slow and also their food just taste okay .
great tapas restaurant it is a bit pricey but you definitely pay for the quality and craftsmanship of the food i would recommend this to people who enjoy a good variety of food andor want a nice place to take a date .
everything looks premade cold cuts all pre cut  all over the place walked out .
giving  stars because we loved everything the dishes we had sea bass  shrimp brussel sprouts fantastic string beans rice great spanish wine list great service enjoyed sitting downstairs in the more quiet area upstairs was very crowed and loud .
ive gone here twice only to find it closed both times their hours dont match up with what is on yelp and nothing is posted on the store front and the phone number goes to nowhere booo .
excellent ambiance fantastic bar and an accommodating staff the menu was eclectic and the service was attentive i cant wait to go back .
the most expensive sandwiches around and that includes manhattan 10 for a half sub the quantities are huge but pretty flavorless and dont forget to bring 2 00 for a cup of deli coffee nothing special more a myth than a legend .
very cool decor and great dinner spot the food is very rich and filling the 3 plates per person is more than enough highly recommend the sea bass .
caveat im a vegetarian so take that with a grain of salt but had the fried eggplant sandwich there it was cold oily and just mushy prolly for the true deli cut eaters a mecca but not so much for vegetarians .
had the charcuterie arugula salad figs wrapped in serrano crispy potatoes lamb chops pork loin and brussel sprouts superb .
service was a bit on the slow side despite not being very busy 14 dollar burger was incorrectly cooked both tries ordered medium rare and got a hockey puck my friends bizarre fish and pasta dish was rather tasteless wouldnt go back again .
went for restaurant week i cant remember the specifics of what we had but the problem was that there was so much pork i have to admit there was plenty more to fill you up and everything was great the ambiance is really nice too .
great beers great bartender worst burger ever asked for pink was dry like a  they offered to replace but the original order took way too long again bar staff was great .
all i have to say is im glad my girlfriend had a  before we went because i ate 130 00 worth of food that was all perfect staff was extremely knowledgable and brought our plates out with perfect timing loved it .
no the fuck thank you ive been here twice and have had horrible dining experiences the food was appalling and my drinks were damn near 200 proof i would never suggest this joint to anyone unless they want to have a shitty ass night .
 a wonderful evening with drinks by nick at the bar moved on to a delicious meal tastefully prepared and beautifully presented sat downstairs which was quiet and intimate loved it food was great some of best tasting dishes we ever had service was incredible thank you .
terrible service asked for water four times before i got it never brought out an iced tea that was ordered the food was good though .
i agree with another yelper that this is one of garces best restaurants we dined out here to celebrate a friends recent move to center city and the food and serve was perfect .
terrible not what it used to be vomit in the bathroom was not cleaned up for over an hour thats not what i paid good money for i will never go back .
one of the best meals weve had in the city we went with our servers recommendations and were very happy pulpo  short rib pork belly well be back .
the beer was quite nice the food was not .
first time in philadelphia and this restaurant is just what i was looking for very cool interior .
awful food one step one very very small step up from mcdonalds too bad the space is fantastic and the beer is quite good my recommendation warm up with a few tasty local brews and head to bin 228 dish or even  for a better meal .
heaven .
the food just wasnt good there were three of us and all had the same reaction the ingredients did not seem fresh tasted like fast food on real plates service was so so .
a little pricey but good food .
meh not for the price .
great food good wine list and attentive service .
below average but then what would you expect in a dump like hartford .
one of my favorite spots diver scallops organic chicken bomba rice i think thats what its called are  of my favorites .
as far as hot dog go its long on history and short on taste hanks franks or weiner house are much better option if you want to eat a hotdog and you dont have to put up with the bullshit attitude .
great service and very good food my only knock is the price but its a very solid option i would go back .
stopped hear for a couple of dogs they were ok the buns were stale the onion rings needed seasoning would  again only if i was in the area .
delicious ive been to tinto a few times and never disappointed the  dishes are the pork belly duck confit and short rib sandwich yum .
what a dump  how did they get so many reviews definitely turned off right now .
tapas are very good here but the food is a tad salty we usually get the tasting menu with wine pairing a big fan of the duck confit with black cherry mussels string beans and olives good for groups too .
have no idea what all the rage is about this place sucks its dirty portions are tinny and the dogs are small n tasteless get a  .
great food great wine great atmosphere perfect spot for a date 45 dishes are more than enough for a party of two some of my favorites are chicken  meatballs duck .
terrible service they slam food on table when its served fries are done in very dirty oil they look burnt place needs to be updated .
the tapas were spectacular tasted healthy and unique the pulpo was phenomenal ambiance was also great the spot is located near village whiskey and seem hidden however the atmosphere inside was quite amazing and service was also great .
this place is a dump if you want good hour dogs in a place that is clean go to hot grill also in clifton .
the food was prepared  .
rutts hut hot grill whats the difference im  guy and that is that .
yes yum and i love you i highly recommend the chef tasting arrive hungry we also loved the chestnut soup and duck canapés excellent wine list great service decor and atmosphere the best jose graces restaurant in philly .
if you want an average at best hot dog then this is your place nothing special at all just a grilled hot dog on a bun the relish is why it gets one star huge disappointment .
bill great service great food great wine definitely will be back whenever we are in philly sit at the bar and drink with bill .
terrible over done dog condiments are horrible staff was rude do not take visitors there not impressed .
went last night after working brunch and shopping had the arugula salad and then the mussels and had the  fruit forward red all were absolutely delightful service was just right and of course the atmosphere is beautiful .
grossly overrated horrid dirty dude behind counter filthy place and just an awful place the dog was mediocre at best dog cart near me is way better it is a dive i dont get the greatness of this legendary place .
very similar to amada portions and service were just right great for foodies and groups dishes are meant to be shared with your party i think it is enjoyable that way instead of ordering separate dishes .
im still pissed i wasted my time driving to  for some hot dogs with an almost  status the hot dogs are nothing  they have a cheap taste and again nothing special this place sucks .
great food great service walked in after a  show down the street for my sisters 21st birthday it was absolutely wonderful .
ripped into a ripper then tossed the rest one bite  that the deep fryer turned the skin into a thick paper feeling texture another bite  it next into the trash .
we had the private room for my 30th birthday and it couldnt have been nicer we had a great time service and the food was incredible .
i feel like its never been cleaned i understand its history and the ordering attitude much like pats in  but pats  it off where rutts just comes across very dbag like if you will .
best tapas restaurant ive ever experienced did the deluxe tasting menu and did not regret it best for a big group of not picky eaters .
gross i imagine deep fried  would taste the same .
enchanting  bartenders orgasmic food good wine .
if you have the nerve to actually go in after seeing the outside it doesnt get much better there was garbage all over the parking lot and along the building it looked like a dump the hot dog deep fried a ripper was exactly that and nothing more .
eaten there loads great food only drawback is tables are close and it can get noisy .
overrated the hot dogs taste weird not because of how they are prepared they are just strange hey taste like tofu dogs not worth the trip .
excellent atmosphere and service each plate was outstanding try the lobster dish it burst with flavor but not overbearing also the rice dish is soooo good great for a romantic night with your favorite person or cool place for friends .
just my opinion no .
its a tapas place their plates might be small but the food tastes amazing the lamb is a must try i love the duck sea bass figs as well .
didnt like this place felt like a truck stop felt very uncomfortable here food tasted like it was all frozen tried it but never again .
im a huge fan i came here with my boyfriend and we both ordered the chefs tasting menu there was way too much food but i was happy with every dish i would definitely come back again for a date .
food wise its delicious service wise just awful time and time again weve ordered delivery and takes them 1 5 hours to deliver it 1 mile but its delicious so im torn but this is just ridiculous now .
went to tinto for some tapas on a friday night we had a reservation and were promptly seated atmosphere very relaxing and comfortable servers were very friendly dishes were just perfect and nicely presented recommended .
food was pretty good but the woman serving and making all the food decides the price of your meal based on her own criteria that has nothing to do with the listed price on the menu seemed sketchy and would like to charged the correct amount .
beautiful presentations gazpacho was flavorful the pork belly and duck were perfectly prepared the sea bass and pulpo delicious the desserts delicious .
pretty classic example of an overpriced restaurant 35 for an entree of good but not great food pretentious farm to table yuppie bs in my humble opinion .
we both had the food tasting and wine pairing they were both excellent with new tastes and  we appreciated the opportunity to explore some very interesting and flavorful wines .
went back with my husband for our anniversary food not so good service not so good not a great experience what a disappointment after such a fabulous first experience .
tinto is really one of the best tapas restaurant in philadelphia their food which occasionally changes is spot on the only reason they didnt get a five is that im not a big fan of their desserts .
ill keep it simple service poor food uninteresting value way over priced sad thing is that i had bookmarked the restaurant almost 6 months prior heard lots of great reviews but fell way short of expectations next .
pricey but delicious .
what i really think of  and pictures to prove their audacity in serving up 1 wilted  drowning in cheap dressing 12 and 2 days old chunks of swordfish 32 cubes fit for making left over fish stew   .
great food again just too much food amazingly as we left my wife said one less fish and something with artichokes that was what we said the last time we went .
overrated good locally sourced ingredients classic cuisine but nothing exciting flavorwise very limited menu overall ok if it was priced at ive experienced better 2 5 stars .
great small plates the duck confit was pretty delicious .
it feels like sf food but not as good i like the concept but it wasnt very good the famous gnocchi was too salty for me .
very good tapas and good selection we loved the octopus .
bad customer service i found a foot long hair in my entree when i brought it to their attention they offered to take it away and thats it the weird part is that they didnt really care .
amazing food friendly service good vibes .
the food was over priced for the taste .
weve dined here a number of times and always left amazed the food is amazing drink list delicious and service second to none .
terrible i have no idea why there are good reviews doughy pizza that was under cooked wheres dat good  pizza at .
first visit nice menu something for everyone good wine list .
do not use the delivery service i waited for 2 hours calling every 15 minutes after the 60 minute expected delivery time i got the same excuses and never received my food it felt like a scam unbelievable .
great dinner had to get a second order of the prawns they were that good this place is a must visit if you are in the rittenhouse square are .
ordered a  pizza probably the most artificially made crap ive ever ordered and expensive too i dont recommend buying from this place its crap pizza .
love it much like amada the food is excellent .
ordered pizza and it never showed called back to check on order and was hung up on repeatedly love their pie hate their service .
i rarely rave about restaurants food but tinto sold me every single thing i ate was amazing service was okay not great and the tables were really close together but the food trumped everything strongly recommend .
the location is actually on 9th just north of south street the crust was tough and chewy me no like .
great creative food good drinks great service one of my regular stops .
ordered from here a few time but never again my large pepperoni pizza had rancid pepperoni on it totally disgusting with all the pizza places in the area ill choose a place that uses fresh ingredients .
not a traditional spanish tapas but food was pretty good have good selection of wine too .
the food is good but the 3040 minute delivery estimate on a sunday night has been and hour and a half so far and im still waiting thats pretty bad right i can wait this long and get a much better pie from  .
tinto is a dinning event a must for anyone who loves tapas .
pizza was the saltiest i have ever had .
great service get the potatoes with blue cheese sauce very good the crab was also excellent .
the delivery was pretty fast but the pizza was only soso nothing special mama  doesnt deliver but the quality is ten times what i got from this place i wont order this again .
its all about a tasty dinner just let them design your experience .
poor service below average food for the price living on the hype but i will not return .
awesome server and wine list .
overrated ive gotten the pulled pork sandwich it was mediocre at best .
garces is legend checked this place out for restaurant week incredible incredible food great wine list intimate ambiance pretty much all  conversation gave way to   appreciation for pretty much everything that came across the table go here go here now .
yes this places serves pre made canned salsa and guacamole but this place has not much mexican food if you like not too bad burgers or sandwiches with french fries then go here if you are thinking of mexican food you will be disappointed .
very good meal go with a group and order a bunch of items to share everything was tasty .
this place is alright ive gone on a weekend and its been pretty empty the food is decent i wish they would put more than a drop of tequila in the margaritas .
visiting family here from la area a good diversity of dishes well prepared good service a little pricey otherwise an interesting and pleasant dining experience .
perfectly bland for those lovers of bland in connecticut .
if anything go for the egg salad i have never had an egg salad like that moist yet dry  yet  just delightful i would go back for the egg salad and the kobe beef .
overpriced and overrated the food is very bland for mexican i ended up  my enchiladas with the  hot sauce they had out on the table the restaurant is extremely loud and its not easy on the wallet .
yes this was a great spot for drinks and dinner fun atmosphere and really nice spanish wines that i had never had before .
i just dont get it give me a real american  with cheddar or give me a  .
great place for date night the portions are small but you will leave full but not stuffed pricey but you get what you pay for service was top notch .
the waiter had to  our group about our  method we felt very  and wouldnt go back because of it this place is not as welcoming as it can be to those who are newly 21 so disappointing .
tinto is a beautiful space the small plates are pretty small but they are diverse and wonderful i highly recommend this place for anyone looking for high quality delicious food in philly you will not be disappointed .
loud divey cheap youll find beers for 1 here yeah 1 for draft but it quickly becomes a shitshow frat party after dinner time go here to pregame and head out at the first signs of uvm .
food was great portions perfect  9 plates and would order all of them again except for the short rib great selection of red wines .
i used to love going to this place in college looks like college kids still do the draft beers have changed and it still smells like a basement dark and dingy oh and no women another place that has lost its luster to me over time .
cozy and intimate great atmosphere i thoroughly enjoyed everything and it was well worth the price i plan to go back .
underage in a frat like underage  girls wearing way too little  this is the place for you .
my favorite restaurant in philly ive been here several times and usually opt for the chefs tasting menu sometimes with wine pairing ive never been disappointed .
why do people always go here its a favorite of st mikes uvm and champlain students but i have no idea why its dark its overcrowded its too loud and its pretty creepy .
this place is great for a date night we decided to get a   and share everything and how could you not there are so many great options on the menu .
ive enjoyed this place in the past but our last trip consisted of a 10 moscow mule served in a plastic beer cup if the drink was well made then i could make an exception but i think it was sprite and vodka .
their brunch is out of control i highly recommend the grits and the pork belly its expensive but we appreciate it every time we go it does not  .
the bar area smells out of one of the three large bottles of beer they offer waiter opened a belgian bottle of beer with a wine  wtf .
been here twice and  keeps getting better everytime jose garces places are always killer incredible wine selection and great for groups since it is tapas style go in expecting to spend a bit more than normal but you will not regret it .
after 20 years of walking past the place i finally stopped in for lunch what a disappointment very limited menu and overpriced for the quality level obviously a good place to have a drink and very pleasant ambiance unfortunately like many of princetons restaurants just over rated .
excellent food everything on the menu is great .
i enjoyed my meal but we couldnt get service at all we had to wait a long time to get drinks meals check everything i wouldnt go back for that specific reason i did enjoy the fries and my burger hence the two stars .
the chefs tasting wine pairing might be one of the more adventurous meals in the city .
i ordered a chicken club i was served a chicken sub basically a wawa sub for 11 seriously not cool 2 stars .
tapas were fabulous waiter was knowledgeable make full use of their recommendations recommend the chestnut soup and the lamb skewers wrapped in bacon .
quite generic pub food .
the food was amazing i am never disappointed with garces go hungry and i would suggest the tasting menu .
this place used to be the best restaurant in princeton about 1012 yrs ago now it is a rundown old dump with ok food and poor service dont bother with the place .
met former colleague and had wine and tapas at the bar great setting good wine and very good food just loved their mixed cheese offering pork belly  and scallops were all excellent choices bartender was also friendly and knowledgeable only downside is the price .
the rolls werent even good the entrees were bland and watery we even found  paper in one of our dishes the water said oh sorry and then gave us the check and we left so overrated .
quieter and a little more formal than the front room amada but same superb food not to be missed .
got the waldorf salad and lamb stew everything was kind of bad the salad lettuce was limp and the lamb was dry too bad i wont be coming again .
good innovative tapas good wine list and great ambiance overall convenient location in the heart of rittenhouse square .
the fennel dusted seared tuna is one of the worst things ive ever eaten the  relish that it came with ill it was salsa sprinkled with capers one of the worst meals ive eaten  .
my 1 fav food in philly hands down .
i see this place changed its name has anyone been to new location was it sold i did not write down the new name i hope the service an food improve only gave it one star had no other choice .
tinto is really awesome the restaurant is comfortable and the food is absolutely amazing i recommend trying the octopus its awesome my only gripe is the servings are very small but extremely tasty every dish pretty much leaves you wanting more great wine selection too .
bad customer service the lady who takes orders picks and  who gets their order first people with  and people who are not regulars are treated bad i will not return to this place food 3 stars .
spot on service food was terrific had the fall tasting menu nice beer selection and the white sangria was really good we left very full tables are close together but not uncomfortably so ive seen worse .
this is not korean dont try it not worth the money michelin has not figured out how to rate korean cuisine undeserving one star money well spent for an undeserving experience .
went there for nye this year great menu fabulous atmosphere excellent wine .
not worth the money the food is really bland totally underwhelmed there is no korean flavor and the mushroom dish is the best dish the service is really superb .
you wont be disappointed definitely but worth it best wine by the glass selection ive seen food is a  delight staff is professional and knowledgeable .
very good food but im taking a star off because its just way too expensive for what you get .
i was at tinto for the first time last thursday we had the tasting menu the food was absolutely fantastic i cant wait to go back .
neither here nor there the quintessential problem with fusion cuisine disappointing the worst is when the sea urchin stinks color me an uni snob highlight was the palate  bad sign you better believe it .
this place is like the lesser version of amada i would rather spend a few extra bucks and go there try the fried oysters and maybe one of the red meats p .
closed 4 years ago .
so much better then amanda yummy the lamb in a stick is an o in your mouth .
rob s also left me a comment about how i must have gone on a bad night and personally mentioned me in his one and only review thank you rob s im sure  will get better with due time just provided my experience .
this place is pricey but totally worth it simply put this restaurant serves some of the best food i have ever tasted .
ordered food from here and my food never arrived couldnt contact the restaurant for help either .
amazing .
isabella we were there the night before i wrote the review so it would have been august 17 around  .
jason was my server impeccable service and perfect food the best way to start your week i had dinner on monday treat yourself and youll have a good week champagne and chocolate desserts never hurt anybody .
i ordered grilled salmon and sautéed spinach for takeout and to my  the cashier told me it was 27 i know i can get grilled salmon and sautéed spinach at any fine dining restaurant in caldwell and it would not be 27 thats offensive .
outstanding dinner had the chefs menu paired with some great wine and just loved it .
stay away service is poor ever time we order delivery its  today it was  better place go prices are a rip off stay away .
  .
italian factory type place have to eat pie there for best results got delivery recently and food was dominoes like no bueno unless u want a quick slice while passing by .
i went to tinto last night and all i can say is wow this restaurant is one of the top restaurants that i have ever dined at i enjoy tapas and feel they had a flawless execution of service and food .
not impressed with the ambiance food or service its average italian food at best with no real emphasis on flavors or being unique just the usual breaded stuff covered with the usual sauces i think they get away with a lot because they are popular .
great spanish tapas at reasonable prices try the amazing chestnut soup .
i dont see the hype about this place the pizza tastes like its come out of a box and the service isnt great id recommend going to angelonis .
we had at least 15 different dishes and there was not one thing i didnt love the wine selection is superb and the ambience is very trendy yet  have the mojito too .
the food just doesnt move me .
wow the food combinations in this restaurant are creative amazing and delicious its like you are eating art i highly recommend this place .
not the best in town since the arrival of angelonis right down the street .
i finally had the opportunity to make it over to tinto this past weekend for my boyfriends 27th absolutely delicious our waiter was very knowledgeable recommended an excellent  and was extremely accommodating to my gluten free diet garces  starr yet again .
i just made my first and last visit take out to john and  it smells great driving by but the pizza was short on cheese and sauce as well as flavor essentially it was oily thin crust .
my favorite tapas bar in town awesome food and great atmosphere .
i have had excellent pizza in this establishment and i have had horrible pizza in this establishment very inconsistent i guess it all  who is cooking will i go back no i just dont like wondering if its going to be good this time around .
im a  for jose what can i say p s they now have brunch on sundays .
gross boring flavorless if it was yummy i wouldnt have mind spending 10 for a small plate of watery steamed chicken and vegetables will not go back .
one of the best meals my  and i have ever eaten we had dinner at tinto during restaurant week and were still talking about that meal absolutely amazing .
this place has the worst chicken ive ever tasted they definitely buy frozen chicken and  and then cook it because its incredibly dry for 10 dollars frozen chicken and veggies is a scam .
i definitely liked it the decor was pleasant the service very good and the food pretty good its not quite amada but i definitely a fan .
overpriced very bland falafel im pretty sure its just baked mashed chickpeas and strangely sweet tahini will not be back .
so many fish and veggie options i love this place every dish has its own  flavor .
dont ever order take out from this restaurant reception was so rude and the rice was made days ago nothing is fresh here worst chinese resturant ive ever seen .
i love this place its my favorite high end restaurant in philly progressive forward thinking food dont love everything  does but this one is really great the fact that philly loves this place so much also shows what a  great restaurant city weve become .
quality going down yes it was very busy but not an excuse for poorly prepared food weve been going there off and over past ten years definitely not as good service is still good we ordered asparagus with garlic the garlic was raw very greasy not worth it .
lord jesus this place is delicious yeah its expensive but worth every penny we did the tasting menu everything was absurdly good but i probably couldve eaten 15 orders of the duck confit the  ham and the steak alone  .
eclectic mix of thai chinese and sushi but quality is below average sad that over the last 10 years they have taken advantage of their status as closest place in town .
excellent tapas inviting atmosphere good service visited during restaurant week excellent menus and options for 35  the meat was the highlight of the tapas plates vegetarian options were good some substitutions if you needed them .
lack of consistency some days are good and some days are beyond bad stick to american chinese food if youd prefer traditional cuisine are not authentic and price are ridiculously high driving 30 minutes north to edison is probably the best bet .
great place by the same chef as amada ask to be seated downstairs possible as the ambiance feels like you are in spain .
this is a sister operation of tiger noodles in princeton go there .
great for lunch i had the  combo both my salad and sandwich were interesting especially for their use of ingredients the salad had asparagus and avocado which were nice touches my steak sandwich was pretty much perfect ill have to come back for tapas .
the noodle is okay other dishes .
i came here late last night with my friend since we didnt want to venture from away from where we were staying all i have to say is blood orange mojito made by ben is simply perfect .
not that great a typical americanized chinese restaurant not really for chinese maybe good for american .
they seem to be greatly amused that a tall  white guy wants to eat pork and scallion congee for breakfast not sure why cuz its super delicious and cheap as hell .
ive got to be honest and say i didnt feel good after the fish i had there maybe they had an off night .
owned by such a cute nice old lady the menu is definitely inexpensive shes super quick with the order i love the rice noodles and fish balls i usually get a medium 3 worth it in my opinion youll be full for a while .
this is not portuguese bbq and the prices are crazy hr customer service is ridiculous we waited 20 minutes before anyone came over to take our drink order save your money and take the trip to newark for real portuguese bbq .
definitely one of my favorite spots she should to be less stingy with the sauce though i think she charges extra .
the pizza is not great feels outdated the fries where also sub par i would not  this as good pizza .
cheap delicious fast and convenient located right outside the f train station east broadway highly recommend the rice noodle with fishballs pork century old egg congee and steamed sticky rice with chicken and other yummy fillings wrapped in  leaves .
i had been here like a year back and definitely i would recommend it then but now the food is not that great pretty pricey for the taste not going to come back .
when i can i try pick up some rice noodles before work it is a cheap delicious eat ask for the soy peanut hot sauces with a dash of sesame seeds if your a fan of fish add some fish balls .
sometimes you just feel dirty after being someplace that is how i felt here i needed a shower this place just wasnt clean food was also what i call  not like what my dad cooks not legit .
5 stars for the nice lady who makes delicious rice noodles and sticky rice to keep me fed during these dark times .
nice bartender very friendly and attentive had a salad fair at best worst part was the nasty smell as soon as you walk in smelled like a mens room .
noodles and fishballs .
nothing special about this place food is bland not sure if any of those reviewing ever ate outside of a chain restaurant in nj .
i am definitely on the love train for this place rice noodle mecca go there now .
this place doesnt deserve any stars it was horrible disgusting omelette and tasteless potatoes oh and the coffee was gross too my daughter found two hairs in her food there is nothing positive about this place go eat somewhere else .
my favorite breakfast spot in nyc amazing  waffles and eggs benedict just dont forget to make reservations and avoid sunday brunch  .
more italian than diner food is so so service is ok theres much better in the area .
nice spot a little overcrowded .
as seafood bars go this is mediocre at best lobster in roll didnt taste very fresh presentation so so .
really great service and really nice ambience lovely french wine list with lots of choices and great cocktails too the waiter was really nice and knowledgeable about wine great service .
waited 20 minutes for someone to take my order left because i was hungry all the yelp reviews were right place is the worst .
amazing food and service would highly recommend we had a reservation for brunch and absolutely loved the food reasonable prices brunch but alcohol prices we kind of obscene enjoy .
disappointing the best way i can describe this place is oversized the prices portions calories fat its all just a little  its not completely awful to eat here just beware of what you order .
incredible duck confit foie gras and chicken liver mousse super cute interior and atmosphere friendly attentive service pricey but to be expected love it .
found a dead fly in my salad and there were a lot of flies near my table very  and gross never coming back .
amazing just a tip you have to make a reservation well in advance .
run if you can we order twice and both times all what u can get is the stomach problems .
breakfast brunch coffee .
the only one that enjoyed the four dishes we took  tso tofu only edible one broccoli and  vegetable dumplings lo mein was the garbage  pity those folk who think highly or even adequately of this place come to hoboken or anywhere else .
this is my second time dining at balthazar and both times have been an absolute pleasure the food while slightly expensive for lunch is well worth the money it is a real gem in the heart of soho and i would recommend it to all .
awesome quality we usually make it to go on saturday night the food is always good and the price is best in the area .
great place the duck confit was cooked to perfection abd the lobster and black truffle risotto was sooooooo amazing the place was packed but the service was still spot on our server was super cool and helpful we will be back .
best i can say is that i wont eat there again i wasnt so lucky .
simply one of the best meals ive ever had just went for lunch and everything was perfect .
as a brazilian guy i was very disappointed and vowed not to come back to this place food was bland there was no variety on the meat just a meh would go to a different place with more variety .
fabulous place for brunch .
all i have to say there were insects in my salad my friday night dinner was ruined for me and my friends i dont think ill be eating at another buffet again .
cozy atmosphere great for a date or family dinner duck  was a little overdone for my taste but the have great wine list and amazing deserts .
not the brazilian food i was craving .
love this place great steak and frites love the beef tartare wonderful wine selection the tables are very close to each other but its nyc sparkling rose is a must when waiting at the bar .
disgusting dirty dont waste your time .
great all around great customer service i cant figure out what is holding back the 5 star portion size price point the wait whatever it is this place is still a good 4 .
 if you like salty food food used to be good lemon chicken is good just salad if 6 99 prices vary depending on who is at the cash register buffet ok lots of food with  and fried things .
a great brunch experience can be absolutely packed and a bit crazy chaotic so not a relaxing brunch but really fun with groups located in great part of soho and highly accessible there breads pastries are off the charts too definitely worth going to book early .
soooo lame food was yuck cold and ugly service was absurdly inept sat on back patio which was nice even gave me the wrong check .
this is a great place to go and feel like you are in paris good is very good and service attentive difficult to get a reservation on the weekends but love their seafood and ambience .
the food is delicious but the low rating is for the customer service i ordered delivery the driver was late which is  but they forgot an item in my order and did not refund me for the item i will not order from them again .
it was such good experience their trout was the best ive ever have strongly recommend it .
i went here looking at the ratings it has got strawberry lassi was horrible it tasted like milk not at all sweet lemon soda was very sour samosa was ok paneer was chewy .
best mimosas anywhere and an outstanding breakfast we had the scrambled eggs with puff pastry and the corned beef with eggs excellent service time to get a table was 45 minutes but we were glad we waited .
ordered at 615 food arrived just before 9pm everything was decent albeit cold except the chicken saag watery flavorless just plain bad id be willing to forgive a bad delivery if the food was good but i cant  by an indian restaurant that cant get saag right .
fantastic meal easy relaxing hot spot .
unfortunately our most recent experience with  has been very negative the manager has changed and the quality of food has drastically  we will not eat here again .
super busy reservation must amazing food especially the  de fruits de  steak tartare .
the food itself was ok but the portions were way too small for the price the place was also understaffed on the night we went with only one waitress for the entire restaurant there are much better options for indian food in montclair .
dinner july 2014 nice open atmosphere although a little loud for conversations foie gras and chicken liver was surprisingly good as was the warm goat cheese and caramelized onion tart good cocktails .
sorry have to differ with a lot of people on this place food was definitely mediocre especially compared to satish or brick lane it looks like theyre new business but my meal was pretty weak everything down to the chips they gave got take out .
i am giving it 4 stars because the food was good but you would think when you order 24 poached eggs you would think they would be runny not hard boiled inside .
quite expensive for what you get the sea bass was good but when youre hitting nyc prices at 30 an entree you gotta remember this is jersey but the place does look nice its just overpriced good for a special occasion but there are better choices around town .
definetly one of the best french restaurants in nyc the food is amazing the atmosphere is very upper class and chic didnt like their foie gras too much though the added salt was a major let down .
terrible bugs service was horrible .
great service marvelous food decent coffee marvelous service gorgeous atmosphere .
unfortunately there were a huge  between an awesome service and the quality of food .
the location is great and i went there with my friends i got balthazar bar steak with fries and with their balthazar sauce the steak was amazing and i love it ill definitely come back next time .
slowest service ever go somewhere else the chicken chili was barely room temp warm as well .
i love love love this place the people the atmosphere the food it can be very touristy but i never mind it i love whenever i get the chance to come here .
eh not impressed maybe the  up north think it taste good but i thought it was mediocre at best .
amazing eatery in soho always packed for a reason the food is always cooked perfectly great cocktails and attentive staff i work in the area and this is my go to for business lunches always a crowd pleaser .
disappointing food but nice decor .
went w my girlfriends and had a blast ordering their 3 tier seafood appetizer soo amazing i cant wait to go back to try other things on the menu and the location in the heart of soho .
crappy service at bar same lame server from applebees where she was very  also bartender should be working at the post office wont be going there  .
came for  day brunch it was busy but the service was good an efficient bloody  were great tangy and tasty beef stroganoff and smoked salmon were great highly recommended .
save your money this place is the worst .
stopped in for brunch last saturday  i must say it was the best eggs benedict ive ever had great job .
really bad even for a cheap chinese food restaurant i expect the food not to taste slimy this would be a good hangout spot for high school kids with low money and lower standards .
love this place awesome food  their duck confit as busy as they are the service is good and the energy and ambiance are thumbs up they know how to run a restaurant would recommend to all my friends .
horrible pizza the sauce is bitter and the crust is burnt .
the service was excellent and the food was superb i ordered duck confit it was amazing my friend ordered the duck shepards pie it was good but not as good as the duck confit my french 75 was perfect i have no complaints .
nope sorry this doesnt qualify as mexican food .
fantastic restaurant love the steak frites gets crazy crowded so make sure you make a reservation way in advance .
well its just true its meh ive experience better was it edible yes was the staff friendly and the restaurant pretty yes is chipotle better yes .
the atmosphere is great and fun but the food is a little off in flavors the smoked salmon was good a little too oily but the sides were a weird combination .
if youre looking for a family friendly place with great service this is it but if you are looking for true mexican food this is not .
excellent food good atmosphere excellent servers .
takeout is probably your best bet a bunch of kids are running the front and they are just interested in chatting it up with their friends basic service was lacking food was pretty good not amazing .
the  salad was phenomenal i ordered the steak which was cooked to medium rare perfection it is very loud so if you are looking for a more intimate quiet environment to dine this is not the restaurant excellent dinner .
friends recommended this place so had to try very far from true mexican experience .
i dream of these fries almost every week love the vibe and food is good in general but they have the best fries in town .
this place gets by on the fact that it is the only  place in upper or downtown montclair there really is not that much to say about it beyond the  yelp  meh ive experienced better so true .
delicious french food has a nice ambiance not for kids or big groups we had the onion soup steak et frites and the lemon mille  for dessert and everything was absolutely delicious i will definitely go back when i visit nyc again .
the food came out fast and good but it was the worst service of my life never coming back again .
the best service hands down water glass is always filled hosts and waitresses are always friendly and attentive food is  a little on the pricey side such a cozy spot cant ever go wrong with balthazar .
cant really think of anything nice to say other than mediocre food at best .
very nice for graduation lunch recommended steak tartar and steak frittes everything made to perfection the only thing though service was a little too much .
eaten here several times usually good for all the reasons listed in other reviews got sick last time wont be  back btw it was the bbq pork taco daughter had the bbq brisket burrito and did not get sick .
loved the sea food yummy great vibe great food great service see you soon when i am next in ny .
kid friendly but service is poor food is inconsistent often quite mediocre a  with prices if a chipotle ever moved to montclair tinga would be a fashion  within a few weeks .
nothing to complain about here pricey yes but you get what you pay for oysters skate steak wine all fantastic come here if you want to eat rich food in a lively place with your fancy pants on .
as per my tip too expensive and not authentic i suppose for montclair this is good mexican .
i was waiting to review this page and now i see they are closed ny eater  .
small selection expensive for how small the portions are and absolutely  of spice .
ordered onion soup its really yum but after that i was so full lol so directly went to desserts overall a nice restaurant .
chili is awful it is basically beans in tomato sauce no flavor they did not include any of the accompaniments mentioned on the menu no cheese no sour cream no rice nothing wendys offers a far better chili that is less expensive this  the  attention .
this restaurant knows how to cook french food and that the secret is adding lots of butter steak with pomme frittes and herbed butter was the best steak and fries i have ever had highly recommend also do amazing pancakes amazing wine list spendy but worth it .
bland food lacks flavor stick with chipotle for decent mexican at this price what a dissapointment .
went here for mothers day we split a le grand chilled seafood tower it was amazing then for the  we got profiteroles what a great experience .
i put this down to 2 stars because they dont accept the restaurant com  anymore this means its not as cheap as the food is p i also like el  in  a lot better .
great food and great service the ambiance was excellent and our server went out of his way to make us feel welcome in new york .
went here recently for quick dinner had a so called chicken fajita it was actually a burrito that was soggy flavorless dreadful wife had a pork burrito that was just soso food was awful would never recommend this place .
good service attentive both had the bar steak medium cooked perfectly but we both thought it needed salt even with the garlic butter fries were perfect as usual no hassle as we had a business meeting and stayed there for over 1 hour would def go back .
very attentive host good food eh .
i cant recommend anything other than steak frites as thats what my mouth demands each time i go there one of my favourite restaurants .
when i say medium i do not want my steak well done the rest of the menu is all meh 2 stars for making a decent dirty martini and nice ambiance .
take a break from your afternoon shopping and get some  and dessert duh it is so good here  .
delicious veggie dumplings but my avocado salad and husbands veg pad thai were soso i see they have a big selection of items with fake meat so maybe they are better with those dishes .
took my daughter on her first visit to new york and it was the highlight of the trip .
pizza isnt anything special the pasta is okay out dated style on the inside some old guy was  a lot not too child friendly was pretty dirty inside prices are high for the food quality they serve .
better than ever had a marvelous brunch with our daughter jennifer her friend just wish our other daughter amanda was here thoroughly enjoyable cant wait to come back .
just another bad customer service spot avoid if possible its confusing you gotta fill out a slip for the sandwich the menu is a mess i wish i had more for you coffees cheap there you go theres one good thing .
great food love this place bartender dave is very nice .
food if just bad i tried the pizza twice and the caesar salad it was all bland and just not good .
it is a must have restaurant in new york i am impressed by all the food that we ordered i took my family there in a freezing spring morning but we enjoyed the brunch it was the best brunch i have ever had .
quality food but terrible service if you would like a roll or an extra tortilla you can go elsewhere you are not allowed to order and pay for additional sides of say sandwich bread .
great service and food .
yea why do i call mexican taco spot and i get some chinese guy answering and taking my order hung up and not ordering from that place i want mexican food i want to hear spanish mexican guy say hello not chinese guy .
delicious and really surprised that the service was so quick considering how busy they were i had the steak pomme frites and it was so tasty the meat was tender and cooked to perfection ill def be back as its a great all  .
waiter should learn what good manners and customer service is im sure the place is great but the waiter was as unfriendly as it gets i didnt even sit down and i left .
a new york classic that is not overrated great for breakfast great for dinner especially the roast chicken .
first the guacamole was subpar then my chicken tostada and chorizo tacos were bland for a place that seems to want to separate itself from gringo mexican food these are  obvious issues the snotty service is just added incentive to stay away .
great friendly service excellent food the scrambled eggs in puff pastry was delicious eggs with spinach and artichoke was also great the bread and pastries at the  next door are awesome .
if it is the same owner as the jersey city location then avoid like the plague that guy is an asshole  wannabe who hates his customers .
the service is great if you are there early you must get the eggs norwegian it is unbelievable .
just tried this with coworkers recently meh food one of the dishes had cold pieces of chicken in it  a frozen and badly reheated dish i liked it slightly better a couple of years ago biryani was ok but the  of the dishes were very unremarkable .
killed it but too expensive .
food still sucks no matter what management its under .
amazing traditional french dishes be sure to try to duck confit and the rabbit desserts are a must .
unfortunately i had a bad lunch experience here i got the uptown burger the onions  uncooked and drawing in grease while the fries were uneatable the whole place smells like old fried oil not pricy but too pricy for the re re re used oil .
delicious fries and a drink that knocked me out .
have been to this place for brunch and it was much better dinner was pretty bad they clearly dont care much about their food the fish tacos were totally flavorless tasted like  minced fish with some flavorless  tomatoes event the burger we ordered was subpar disappointing .
food was great and the staff was excellent if you want to be treated well come to this place .
i had the steak frites and was disappointed the steak was thin and tasted burnt and was full of gristle and about one third of the fries were overcooked and inedible i wont go here again .
duck confit was just ok desserts were really impressive better to make a reservation come to have fries and dessert p .
everytime i go there its an hour long wait and i leave annoyed so i wont be going there good luck .
the old girl has still got it cool bar good looking  crowd and excellent service not to mention well executed french cafe staples nice selection of fresh oysters too .
overrated there is absolutely nothing special about the food here and the space with its awkward seating is nowhere id like to go back to unless someone really insisted not really sure how theyve stayed in business this long .
one of her favorite places to go for brunch when were in town a bustling interesting atmosphere the food is always good make a reservation ahead as its difficult to get in for a walk in on the weekend .
8 for a cup of tea that tasted like nothing not about that life also super uptight atmosphere no thanks .
great bartender service  french onion soup crazy good beef  found myself in the area midday and popped in for some warmth and a drink classy fun and great people watching a must .
the dessert is good but no reservations minimum 3045 min wait when there are tons of open tables i hate when restaurants do that im waiting at the top of steep stairs glaring at those six empty seats  .
im happy to say that every few years i head to nyc and pop into balthazars and every time i am happy with the food its a big deal to be consistent and were talking years ive had multiple items on the menu and everything has been delicious .
wait time is decent ordered a beer didnt get it ordered salmon toast they forgot it party of five with friends server didnt seem apologetic so it was like i didnt even eat there due to service .
seriously one of my favourite places in the whole world the location the deco the food the service are all outstanding they  a perfect egg for breakfast the moules are really juicy too people watching in here is one of my favorite pass times .
nice place and good service we tried only desserts but for the price they were not good at all we trusted the reviews and tried the sesame brûlée and chocolate soufflé with raspberry sauce it wasnt good left disappointed .
love the  came here for brunch had the french onion soup a little salty for my tastes eggs were good and the scrambled eggs in  puff was always delish saw a lot of beef stroganoff go around might order that next time .
cha an was very disappointing i tried it because it has 4 5 stars on yelp the service was terrible  table visits from our waiter no water  menu and absurdly small portions we got sick from the undercooked pork appetizer as well .
classy  with style and history very nice food and wonderful wine selection prices are not to high and deffinately worth .
the food was really terrible we ordered the cha  bento box and the salmon smelled fishy chicken was not appealing the desserts however were wonderful will come back for desserts and tea which its known for .
even though i think the food here is just ok i love this place its always packed so have a reservation or be ready to wait for a table personally i love sitting at the bar have some oysters and enjoy the people watching .
i was truly disappointed with the service here they totally ignored us as if we didnt exist this place was one of the places that i was looking forward to but i guess not anymore .
this place takes brunch food to a whole new level we went here with a group of about 15 friends and each and every person loved it if you are looking for the brunch spot in ny look no further .
it was just ok nothing special the food wasnt good and the desserts are just ok i wont go back again .
perfect the duck confit was succulent and perfect that is all one needs to know mixology of the cocktails might perhaps   this place is my  until i saw my bill lol .
i must have missed the  boat its small hot and fussy i did not feel serene or relaxed at all .
fantastic for brunch impeccable service and even better menu the brioche french toast was superb went on a busy saturday morning and we were seated right away simply wonderful food of course there is the occasional celebrity sighting as well .
order was completely wrong after they assured me that it wouldnt be a problem wouldnt bother coming here again or at all if you havent .
sat at the bar this sunday and had cisco serve us by far the most amazing service and hospitality ive ever received from someone forget waiting for a table go straight to the bar ask for cisco order the shell fish platter the pate and rejoice in  .
3 stars for food 1 star for service decent  lunch  type of place but the  is very bad and inconsistent pancakes were pretty good had a  texture that i enjoyed eggs were cooked well you could do better elsewhere .
here for the brunch today the egg benedict is mind blowing i give it for 5 starts the ham and potato are perfect the french toast is just so so .
this place is awful the bread was cold and stale the salad was soggy and the main dish  was lukewarm and salty wont be going back to this overpriced place ever the only good thing about this place was the service the waiter was attentive and nice .
we recently had breakfast here and will definitely be back the smoked salmon was amazing we tried the herb omelette as well with cheddar cheese and would recommend this place .
we had a mixed experience first we were seated next to a large group that was very loud throughout most of the dinner the food was mixed the steaks were good but the pork special was a bit overcooked and was tough the clams casino tasted terrible .
love this place i always have lunch here whenever im downtown i love the duck and always grab coffee from the cafe next door .
poor quality the soup tasted like it came out of a can the bread was stale and the meat was under seasoned the service was decent but not enough incentive to come back .
great french environment went for breakfast had a booked table a bit crammed with small tables and not much  space maybe its a french thing great enjoyable food and decor would recommend it .
just rude i couldnt believe how rude all the staf was and just will never go again not getting this customer again .
charming place even if overcrowded they recomend to book in advance but if you are 2 persons they can always find a place within a few minutes you must taste duck shepherds pie drinking a negroni worth the visit .
do not do take out they didnt understand our simple order and the manager gave me attitude he was so rude and it was so disrespectful .
a little too fancy for brunch the options are really decadent maybe ill go back for dinner i wasnt too impressed with the weekday brunch menu .
there is much to choose from if your looking for variety it tastes alright not bad or good i wouldnt waste my time or money with this place go to a good chinese food place there are a few winners around .
french onion soup and the burger are phenomenal fries are regular frozen fries meh the bread basket is superb salted butter mmmmmmmm yes coming back here after the holidays to try the steak frites cant wait .
if youre thinking of eating here dont .
this was my first time there and i was not disappointed we were made to feel very welcome everything from the food to the service was impeccable i cant wait for my next visit .
skip this place if you are a vegetarian i tried 3 vegetarian sliders worth the 3 different sauces pesto tomato and parmesan which were okay but the actual vegetarian ball was horrible half cooked beans without salt or pepper and not with the 3 bucks a pop .
i was there recently brunch was really good staff friendly and on pint i will recommend this place .
over hyped restaurant in nyc chicken vegetarian meatballs couldve tasted much better there are restaurants out there who can do awesome job you have to admit that their prices are more affordable but i wouldnt  for the better experience .
this place is gorgeous though one must make a reservation weeks in advance or wait a long time we had very nice steak short ribs skate mussels we had a great waiter for our party of 6 paris in nyc .
overall subpar food way too salty but terrible service makes it something you should skip .
great space and food its an nyc must .
i dont understand why people are so into this place this place isnt good .
great food one of my favorite places to eat in nyc decor is nice only downside is that you have to reserve weeks in advance in order to get in .
every meatball aside from the veggie has pork in it so beware if you are health  about pork .
really fun place good energy we started with some champagne at the bar then had great dinner moules frites was good reasonably priced wine list a slice of old paris in new york to be redone .
has anyone met the owners   hes a total db and from what ive heard hes been a db for a very long time amazing people who treat the general public and employees so poorly stay in business eat at your own risk .
a big treat to dine in this reasonably priced and delicious french restaurant the mussels frites are delicious along with the fresh beet salad the raw seafood platter is also very  definitely a keep reservations highly recommended .
tight loud and overrated .
sensational escargot and steak au   delish the service was wonderful 10 pm seating on a random night was just as fabulous as a 730 pm on saturday night its a must .
maybe one of the most overrated places in nyc and whatever you do please dont open your takeout in the restaurant you will rudely thrown out of the restaurant .
i love balthazar impeccable service and the food is consistently amazing things to order that wont let you down escargot french onion soup steak tartare the oysters make a reservation also great wines by the glass .
just meatballs with sauce at the end of the day nothing special dont go out of your way but if you want some late night munchies while being drunk and is in the area go for it .
the  is amazing here ordered 2 and i recommend the steak and frites medium rare then you can die happily .
dont try ordering takeout from here 15 minutes just to get someone on the phone .
great ambiance for groups and really solid food .
the service was less than stellar and the food was not hot at all my irish mother can make bigger and better meatballs that this  shop .
fantastic dinner roasted chicken was the best i have ever tasted linguine was great tasting but i think i paid a bit for eating that much garlic service terrific .
this place is complete bs mediocre food horrendous service the hostess will never be as cool as she has decided she is i have been here several times and each time it has gotten more pretentious and lazy avoid .
fantastic place went for a very special occasion and it did not disappoint great service great food i would recommend the dishes we ordered but im sure everything is delicious there having said that the duck confit was amazing .
for a meatball place their meatballs are just mediocre tending to be on the drier side i always enjoy the pasta under or sides more then the balls but its not called pasta side shop is it .
a great spot for lunch if you are walking by we never make reservations and usually can get a table if we cant we keep walking for dinner a completely different situation reservations are a must .
manager some new chick with short hair was very rude told me wait outside for my take out order didnt ask me politely if i didnt mind doing that you ask you dont tell people what to do .
the long wait for a table was worth it good brunch food .
the ambiance is cool and beer cheap however the meatballs are dry without enough sauce  are better .
higher priced restaurant but very worth it everything was delicious this place is ultra busy though you need a reservation or you will be waiting for 3 hours .
food is good but the wait was not well organized for large parties hostess was not smart enough to make better seat arrangements to accommodate first come customers .
two words eggs benedict .
love the neighborhood thought the meatballs were spicy and disappointing the restaurant is small and loud especially the music and crowded food came out fast but overall thought its overrated and portions are very small .
classic french food very well executed prices are high but the quality and service is as well .
the manager kindly responded offering to host me on my next visit sounded very sincere cant knock em for that id go back .
balthazar is one of the classic downtown spots it looks like a real parisian brasserie and has the raw bar to match i love this place .
no delivery please .
its very expensive but the french toast was amazing .
what the  is wrong with this place bumping nwa bumping it at 7 balls are amazing though 4 5stars guess they can play whatever but not giving props on yelp for that even though i have a few nwa songs on my  .
really enjoyed this place nice little brasserie pretty typical bistro fare so if this is your thing you know what to expect a wee bit pricey but ah well .
beef meatballs cooked in pig fat really and then it wasnt even stated clearly on the menu really wish i could give a half of a star outrageous .
if you want to feel like you are in paris with a touch of new york this is the place to go martini is great and the food is as in the best french bistro try the oysters we love it .
food and prices are fine but the service is horrible ill never go back here .
one needs to experience it at least once while in new york it keeps true to the french bistro vibe food is decent but can get bettter more reasonably priced bistro style food elsewhere .
i dont get what all the fuss is about with this place the meatballs are average at best and absolutely not worth the incredibly long wait they have good beer on tap and the staff are friendly but if youre after amazing meatballs i suggest you look elsewhere .
my absolute favorite i eat at least 3 meals here whenever i am in new york not to mention the bar which is great people watching and amazing service home away from home .
tiniest balls ive ever seen .
love love love this place my favorite restaurant in nyc whatever you order will be amazing the staff is fantastic and helpful and the decor is one of the best parts if youre and french fan and even if youre not go here .
possibly one of the most overrated spots in the city it was ok but nothing worth waiting in line for .
simply excellent tremendous service decor and food a little expensive but hey its soho .
this place is just ok its tastes like the meatballs youve been eating your entire life get over it .
food is good and fresh famous nyc stop make sure you have reservations or else prepare for a long wait service is very good no complaints at all good location as after lunch we walked around the shops in the area .
do not get the hype the bread was mushy the meatballs and sauce were bland the crowd looked like they were shipped in from connecticut .
dinner wine and atmosphere all a everyone at the table all had different dishes and different choices of wine selection not one person was disappointed .
this was really disappointing my order was lost and my brother finished his at least five minutes before mine even came the food was  forgettable im not even into writing this just dont go there .
i have been to balthazar twice now both times i have fallen in love and went to breakfast heaven a place to take all friends family when they are in nyc .
would go back for the ice cream sandwich meatballs were just ok not worth the wait unless youre just getting a peanut butter cookie ice cream sandwich to go yummm .
the frites are amazing the restaurant decor reminds me of typical parisien brasserie good food pretty close to the one that i eat in paris .
it was a 2 dry meatballs not very tasty meatballs the salad was really good the service was really on the money the meatballs were mediocre sorry many friends raved but tonight not so good .
i love this restaurant amazing omelets great service and you always leave knowing you had a great meal that was made by people who care and have standards it is always packed and yet you always feel as if you get the right service kudos .
i used to go there all the time at least once a week theyve really gone downhill everything just isnt the way it was .
other reviews says it all i dont think i have to explain much check out the pics its amazing noms .
the fish is so damn fresh i just found a scale in my spicy salmon roll .
met friends for a french breakfast in soho very parisian place very good breakfast great decor it was packed it always is and very hot inside definitely recommend it .
food great service solid advertising 25 off happy hour drinks on the same  board that your special are on then claiming sorry thats only for the bar upstairs an unsavory end to an otherwise pleasant meal .
my wife and i had a wonderful time here when visiting the city the food was exceptional and the service was terrific the only reason this doesnt get a 5 star is that the prices are a bit extreme if you want to indulge enjoy .
worst dining experience in philly to date  service mediocre very overpriced food poorly presented and what a dank ratty interior what a waste of time and money .
best french fries in new york really good authentic french food and an incredible raw bar apple tarte tatin was only ok though really great atmosphere and really feels like your in france .
bad service mediocre food we were inconvenient for the waitstaff .
worth going back to yes ive been multiple times and plan to keep doing so dish worth ordering again warm goat cheese and caramelized onion tart yes shrimp cocktail no lobster risotto yes steak au poivre no steak frites yes .
the food is okay certainly not worth the price the salad was fine thats not too hard the ravioli was okay but the sauce it came in was gross dessert was almost inedible .
this place is awesome food was great and so was the staff i had the steak au poivre my meat was cooked to perfection for dessert we had profiteroles and they were fabulous make sure to make a reservation ahead of time .
sub par bbq came here twice the burnt ends were decent the ribs were more like beef jerky fries not very good mac and cheese good but nothing remarkable beans were good .
does a good brunch a nice bloody mary a nice eggs benedict served in beautiful surroundings by professional staff .
mediocre food poor service .
delicious french onion soup and beets salad steak and fries were ok .
awful service no free refills was in the bathroom for hours after it took an hour to get a coke with no free refills hate this place we live here there goes the neighborhood ive had better meals at applebees bar grill and applebees certainly offers free refills .
food is good i had the duck confit .
this the most nasty place is like no the same went i wast the  time 1 year ago but is hipster wherever food bad place ok and  the best and over price for empanadas .
the atmosphere is typical new york loud and proud steak was tender with good flavor i remember the fries were salty and delicious even saw  law in a near booth .
empanadas are just ok the cubano is good though maybe a bit overpriced overall impression meh .
amazing food and service loved our sweet waiter they even gave us complimentary champagne and pastries for our short wait huge fan i will definitely be back .
the cuban sandwich gave off a bit of a school cafeteria vibe empanadas were served half lukewarm and half cold i dont know if it was just an off night but im not sure that i would return .
i was impressed with the décor as i walked in and by the buzz of activity this be everyones favourite the service was friendly and attentive and the food lived up to the hype .
the food was good but i spent 20 dollars and i left starving the entree portions are not meant to feed even children .
what a scene what a lamb sandwich those fries .
really wish the  was better than we were told it is a tired locals place the food weve had is not  from visit to visit .
long waits but worth it definitely good to try it at least once i would come back but be prepared for the wait .
burger was okay service was eh sat outside plastic cups for beer  was fun after dinner .
this is a great place to stop in for a quick breakfast .
nice location and  area however i didnt care for the food its well priced but nothing special i ate a steak while i was there an wasnt thrilled .
walked in on a incredibly busy saturday morning seated right away and   i want to say i had the squid  and some kind of  grill cheese sandwich hostess was great to get us in without waiting the brunch menu should satisfy anyone .
skip moes and make the drive to the new chipotle on route 1 moes cannot compete with similar businesses when it comes to taste and selection they fall short of being a go to mexican fast food place as they are not that fast .
best fries in the world period .
taste is no taste  less than chipotle fresh  not fresh at all salsa are old canned type will never come back  it is not worth wasting your money or time once chipotle opens in this area this place will close down for sure .
good food and great drinks highly recommend for brunch return yes frequency occasionally .
i dont think this is a real japanese restaurant most likely chinese owned trying to pass for japanese anyway its has no ambiance and the food is very average not worth the stop .
they have the best fries in the world eat the caramelized banana ricotta tart it is awesome .
decent food but overpriced for what it is also the setting is a bit  service could be better too too bad .
one of my favorite spots for sunday lunch .
found a fly in takeout rice will never go back .
quite good food beautiful place and friendly staff the duck was slightly chewy but everything was tasty very noisy difficult to have a conversation .
closed out of business kaput building for sale .
love balthazar amazing brunch  definitely worth the wait got the waffles with berries and was an amazing sweet dish highly recommended .
 spain chicken cordon bleu i didnt have it but seeing the dish on the menu made me suspicious about the authenticity my taste buds were let down review  i m y .
 amazing bistro restaurant service and food are always spot on not cheap but its always packed and popular from 7 30am till 2am seven days a week a unique restaurant .
just tried to get a salad and i was told fairly rudely no salad it was 630 supposed to be open until 8pm shame on you old  i frequently get my breakfast items there but now im seriously turned off by their poor customer service .
my favorite steak tartare with fries in this city super fresh hand cut beef marinated with capers evoo and a little red onion topped with a quail egg simple classic and to the point .
the worse minestrone soup pure tomato sauce no consistency of beans vegetables or pasta the bartender said he was sorry  a business ourselves we would of offered a drink on the house very disappointed .
duck confit is good but hard to not order the classic steak and frites .
ordered citrus chicken delivered cold returned and came back warm sitting in a citrus greasy  no bread served ordered sparkling water never saw it the decor is very cool other then that there will not be a repeat performance .
one of my favorite brunch locations anywhere the eggs  will change your life .
i like the atmosphere here but the menu is boring nothing seems very appetizing weve ordered cocktails which are pretty good and dinners and its just alright i wouldnt eat here again but i will stop in at the bar for drinks every now and again .
consistently delicious oysters and steak frites is all you need to know .
weve gone here a few times with friends there are no vegetarian options except salad the menu is pretentious and overpriced including the 14 salad for the vegetarian were over it there are better options in hamden .
the food here is very awesome and so  french the vibe is high paced and rather loud the staff is very polite oh yeah did i say the food is very yummy i went her on my way to paris to get  for the vibe .
limited menu ok food indifferent service above average prices enough said .
awesome lamb sandwich and good service restaurant is super busy so be sure to make reservations also its pretty loud in there so dont expect any quiet  time .
i went here for a simple breakfast just waffles and eggs when it came it looked yummy but didnt taste as it looked waffles tasted like the freezer ones and there were a ton of shells in my eggs not good very disappointed had higher expectations .
simply delicious perfectly executed french cuisine loved everything about the experience escargot appetizer and lobster truffle  we left full and happy we will be back .
horrible service .
one of my favorite places in nyc whenever im in town i make a point to stop there the service is fantastic and you may spot a celeb or two .
while there were many empty tables we waited almost a hour until they served over a dozen customers who came in after us so we went and asked the waitress who was extremely rude and explained that they dont have a table ready for 3 .
everything about this place is amazing the service food and ambience was fantastic make sure you make a reservation we waited 45 mins for a table for two on a tuesday night .
your service and your food terrible you must to  before late thank you .
lovely lunch but problem with coat check made us wait 15 minutes just to get our  back .
the worst cuban sandwich i ever had dry so so very dry .
great dining experience in soho .
i used to love this place delicious cubano sandwiches arepas tostones yucca fries lately i have found the sound level to be far too loud for relaxed dining and conversation .
their steaks are the best and 18 for a carafe of nice wine is very reasonable .
see matt  review i was with him pretty disappointed by what village voice said was supposed to be one of the top ten burgers in town from what i could tell they cant even cook a patty .
my favorite restaurant in new york there isnt anything in this place that i didnt like its always always crowded but i didnt mind sitting at the bar a couple of times french fries are the best .
 service pretty good food a little plain but we were trying to eat healthy kinda weird that they took the tip without saying anything before bringing us our change and then expecting a tip again .
good food location more casual than youd expect .
decent enough but inconsistent delivery have gotten our complete order only once out of at least 7 attempts .
update it still rocks all the standards plus well thought out and executed specials great ambiance bar is terrific staff is very welcoming if you like noisy  places with great food go here .
twice in a row with pick up issues officially lost my business by the way management a simple apology would go a  instead of no eye contact and pretending like im not standing there waiting awkwardly for 20 minutes .
the food is quite good i had the salmon and as salmon goes it was some of the better ive had the atmosphere is  does seem like a french brasserie plus john  was eating there at the same time which always speaks well of the restaurant .
where are all these reviews coming from the owners anyway the sushi is not good here weird and inattentive service which was not appreciated tip to server if u forget a tables appetizer apologize .
good french food in the soho area of nyc the place is always packed so i would recommend a reservation .
nothing special about this place will never try it again .
im going to keep saying this over and over steak tartar and balthazar steak yum yum yum attentive service great food got a table in the bar area quickly at dinner time there is nothing else to say food great service great experience great .
horrible old flavorless food .
solid 4 5 from me very upscale setting and environment personally for the price i paid it was nothing spectacular but the interior and the ambiance gave a boost to my rating try it out but be prepare to pay the bill .
awful pizza was dry n cold when they delivered it not to mention it was an hour late .
the food really is good there the waffles are sooo good crispy the dough is amazing the service is okay had to work to get our waters refilled the dessert was just okay also didnt get enough bread for the foie gras .
used groupon and the service sucked the price was so high for so so good we will never come back .
great food service is friendly and efficient consistently delivers the best .
terrible customer service manager and waitress wouldnt accommodate table change the table we wanted remained empty the entire time we were there the waitress manager  us until we moved .
love it simply perfect .
probably the worst food in the area they still carry a decent amount of craft beers but now so does every other restaurant .
incredible pan roasted chicken incredible chocolate cake for such a nice restaurant it lacks  .
this is one of the most overrated restaurants around the food is simply mediocre thats it .
this place is an institution love the ambiance and the food doesnt disappoint either beautiful crowd one of those places to see and be seen a favorite for sunday brunch .
over rated i guess i just dont get it good place to drink but to eat it a crap shoot same dish can go from a b to f next time in .
ive been going to balthazar from day one when it opened after all these years it never dissapointed it can be very crowded and long wait for a table i always get the seafood grand  you gotta see it to believe it what an experience .
the drinks were ok and the food was tastless overall nothing to write home about good service  attempt .
great experience food was great service was outstanding a .
despite the internet stating that they allow dogs it isnt true the queue was massive so we have up left very disappointed .
their wine list is amazing came here for happy hour and the place was packed bartender was great ordered the app size of their seafood risotto and i was speechless best risotto ive tasted wish i wouldve ordered the entree size will definitely come back here for dinner .
not anything special and the coffee was lukewarm and tasted bland like a dunkin donuts the eggs and toast with home fries were very ordinary needing salt and the toast was underdone and had almost no flavor expensive for very little .
loved the beef stroganoff oh my cant get enough of it and the service was absolutely wonderful waiter was very attentive  the place was very busy i will definitely come back .
i literally waited a half hour just for a toasted bagel with cream cheese everyone that came after me ordered very complex meals and got there orders the service for me was lousy .
simply  experience waiter is the best a bit noisy but food is amazing .
not a fan maybe i have to try something different but the turkey burger sucked but the sweet potato fries were pretty good and the smoothies werent bad .
pricy but delicious pâté was some of the best ive had the trout was grilled to perfection had a  and plum tarte which was outstanding wife had mussels and frites both were excellent very nice decor friendly staff a little loud but not unreasonable .
reviews are stellar and the ambiance is good but how does a place with such a reputation serve processed american cheese on its grilled cheese they should be serving the ultimate grilled cheese and instead its oily plastic .
the best french bistro i have ever been to i think bouchon in napa valley may be the only place that could compare to this great ambiance great food great service loved it .
salty  turkey burger and fries it was  it was  .
they have the best food ever i must go there every time i visit ny really good service and food .
yeah this just screams nope its all family style so its just one big plate and you share thats fine an all but not really my style also yeah its nyc but fu it was expensive i just didnt care for it sorry .
balthazar is always a favorite goto for good french fare specially  we are looking for a meal  promises not to disappoint .
i am just not a fan of family style restaurants especially when those restaurants offer such little gluten free items honestly i am shocked that nyc has such little gluten free options to offer nice family friendly our waiter was super friendly and informative .
great lil french bistro a little disappointed we couldnt get mimosas since they dont service alcohol early sunday mornings great cup or i should say bowl of latte eggs benedict was pretty good .
not impressed we got the chicken marsala it was blahhhh would not recommend pick another spot .
came here for sunday brunch sour cream hazelnut waffles with warm berries were good but their hot chocolate was so good i had another one their  omlette was not very good hence the 4 stars .
food was ok service was horrible it was just there she took our order brought us drinks had to search and beg for refills and brought our food definitely not worth the price .
balthazar is a reason to go to new york in itself and every time i go to new york i go to balthazar it doesnt get any better than that the room is amazing the menu  and the wine list next to none .
terrible phone reception hangs up without a good bye rude .
i love this restaurant the food is great the ambiance charming i especially love their brunch and highly recommend the hazelnut belgian waffles yum .
ive had better this place has become a noisy food factory serving  italian food .
yep a busy saturday night so ended up sat at the bar great atmosphere and the steak frites were good .
the bread was great but entrees and sauce tasted sour olive garden  this place super pricey and portions way too large for the first date  the blueberry mojitos are very good go for cocktails and a bread basket then leave .
great food great service very very cool place food 4 service 5  4 .
the quality certainly is not the same as it used to be waiters just sloppily serve u and the food is sub par .
greatest french food on earth .
off all the italian places in nyc why go here yes portions are big and family style and service was good but food is mediocre at best chicken  was salty tepid and the sauce was watery an absolute tourist trap that i hope to never return .
wonderful they handle big crowds like they handle brunch seamless and tastefully .
meh been there a few times not impressed there are far better restaurants in the city .
i went here for breakfast and it was sooo yummy how do they cook their scrambled eggs so well i dont know but they were really really nice and i dont even normally love scrambled eggs .
tourist trap food served on large platters family style covered in tomato sauce .
went for a sunday brunch chicken liver and foie gras mousse is what you would expect delicious and the sour cream hazelnut waffles are great as well .
its been a while since ive eaten here i remember the food being fine and the portions being very large but what really stuck out at me was how incredibly hard not al dente but hard the noodles were maybe i just dont get it dunno .
always good classic french cuisine  buenisimo .
this place is grossly overpriced nice bartenders though .
came in for brunch and it was pleasantly packed had the beef stroganoff and toast cant wait to come back .
this place is a rip off not authentic italian restuarant its just like any other chain restuarant and the food is priced way high nice way to  if tourist .
fabulous perfect ny dining experience amazing selection of wine the chicken dinner dish is excellent and authentic felt like i was in paris for a night .
overrated probably from all the tourists that go there way too packed and food bland not worth the tourist trap .
the decor is great the restaurant is very crowded lots of tourists food is good not remarkable could use a few lower priced bottles if wine waited 1 hour after my reservation if you live in nyc there are other very good options service was excellent though .
not a good idea if you are a small group like two or so we left almost more than half of the dishes .
finally experienced balthazar and how special it was for a special occasion do it up with the seafood tower amazing .
didnt even get to go in our reservation was screwed up and we were not allowed in then treated as if were our fault there are much better guessing service friendly and good italian eateries that will actually allow you to dine in nyc check them out first .
hand down the best breakfast ive ever had in my life this is a place everyone must go to and experience .
i thought this place was going to be way better with all the hype it gets much better italian food in little italy .
quintessential new york experience the fries are perfect i love the vibe the food and the desserts this is a  restaurant every time i come to new york .
there are certainly better places to spend your money for familystyle italian food in nyc .
best oysters and french fries grab a bottle of champagne and have a great meal .
the food doesnt match the legacy if you want good family style go to long island because this place is the olive garden disguised by family style portions combined with a tourist trap i cant believe i waited an hour for a table here .
great food and service clean and inviting ive had the eggs  and the steak and loved it yum yum yum a must if you are in nyc cool casual vibe and oh so tasty is a recipe for  .
the food potions in the restaurant are monster portions just waste of money .
i tried the bakery it was amazing fresh and natural ingredients not cheap but worth it .
how can a city like ny even have one of these they are the mecca of italian restaurants find a hole in the wall italian place where its fresher and you dont have to wait 2 freaking hours for poor service expensive prices and soso food .
breakfast was great traditional french  menu espresso was spectacular great to know someone still knows how to make real coffee .
good food but terribly overpriced there are tons of italian restaurants that serve big portions for a portion of the prices that they charge at carmines .
they serve stumptown coffee in giant bowls yumm and the bread and cheese plate is delish .
long lines food is ok but upper westside locale is so much better .
its a modern classic a little  but classic .
seriously get some menus if you like  line generic and overpriced italian then this place is for you the food and service were abysmal id rather cold canned soup .
this review is intended for the bakery an absolute revelation for french breads and pastries when they offer them you must  and taste a  .
we had lots of appetizers and pasta entrees everything was really salty i had to wash it all down with pitchers of water and coke .
love this place feels like youre in paris without ever leaving the states food isnt elaborate but is done very well seafood is delicious and the martinis are on point .
the sad thing about giving this restaurant one star is that the food isnt half bad for a  dinner based on taste i prefer carmines over  but a cockroach ran across the table during my meal nuff said .
definitely one of my favorite restaurants in nyc i scored a seat at the bar just before they stopped serving hot food between 57 pm it was cold and rainy outside which made my mac and cheese taste that much better i love this place .
although people say they have good burgers i wouldnt know since i couldnt get in to try them without waiting an hour and a half and you cant make reservations either ridiculous go across the street to shake shack and save some money and no waiting .
went here last week for a work dinner in nyc and it was amazing the food is delicious the service top notch and the dessert was to die for highly recommend the steak frites .
waited a full hour for food this place sucks didnt even comp us stated they were trying to bring everything out at the same time .
delicious attentive to our needs and saw  ryan in there on my way out very good experience over all .
food looked good nice decor hip crowd and crowded on a tuesday  good things i just thought no room at the bar no music just  not inviting so we left ill try it again but for now no go .
one of my nyc favorites love the ambience the martinis the steak frites moules and most of all the 3  of shellfish .
waaay overpriced for a greasy burger the pickles are a nice idea but  for an appetizer sized plate of vegetables in vinegar .
if you are in soho this is a great place to dine its always crowded and loud but thats just nyc the food is amazing i have eaten there a few times and will keep going back the brunch is really great as well .
sadly my expectations werent met here the burgers cant compare to rouge and im so over their no reservations policy and tiny cramped space nothing spectacular here jose garces youve done me wrong .
balthazar is classic romantic this is where i had my first champagne exceptional food and service .
awful expensive crowded horrible waitstaff .
it had the french soul and they accidentally served me french fries with my omelet considering it was noon and i was hungover it was unknowingly an excellent surprise .
i wanted to like this place it was nice inside an ok menu however the atmosphere was  because it was full of rude wannabes we ended up walking out after a patron  to move her bag to allow us to sit .
definitely need a reservation otherwise its a long wait tip try getting a seat at the bar we went there for dinner and came back next day for brunch awesome pancakes oysters pate escargot great wine selection .
waitress had a real attitude food was good but service was  i will not be going back .
very good food the interior decorations is amazing it seems to be in a french restaurant .
food is ok but not worth the chaos long wait terrible service .
last time i was here i saw two celebs one being anthony bourdain who sat next to us anyways ive always enjoyed the steak frites and i got the mango cheesecake this past wkend and it was so good .
cash only establishment thats pretty average the inside looks dated but the food is acceptable nothing wow here .
great food and awesome service we did brunch and it was surprisingly good so worth the time and effort to get over there .
decent chinese food for the area but just slightly on the dirty side their pork fried rice is better than others but again its probably better to get this as take out and have your friend pick it up so you dont have to go in there .
same amazing food than pastis same chef with a upscale  brasserie ambiance loved the manager host at the desk he is so awesome both breakfast and dinner were  .
i asked for  and it came with bad lemon not to forget that drink was bad our wings came sans ranch and blue cheese which was specially requested all in all bad experience .
yum steak frites was amazing .
bad execution only ok sushi never actually got my dinner better places out the .
one of the best restaurant in new york the goat cheese tart is to die for i am eating 2 of those every time i am there and then a grilled fish with there special sides yummy .
reasonable service i had the mac and cheese and it was so bland my friend had the sweet potato fries which were yummy nothing special and i wouldnt go back .
i only had the pleasure of eating at the bar once but i was convinced the best steak tartare in the city easily .
the service is horrible our server  at me when i politely asked for a drink the bartender rolled their eyes with my order and walked away without serving it these people hate their jobs and it shows i will never go back to that horrible place .
duck confit was  cute  .
great ambiance service is slow which one can get over if the food makes up for it sadly although the menu was promising my  burger was like rubber sad but true .
excellent great service and food i ordered the french toast my dining partner ordered the burger no complaints i want to go back and order the  frites the french fries are bomb i want to go back soon .
just tried to call to order pickup they said they couldnt because they are too busy due to the 2 games going on right now what happened to businesses wanting to make .
value average food good but nothing special of out of the ordinary service good but as expected for price range atmosphere tourist trap but decent enough not too noisy the food was as expected for the price range would repeat if im not paying .
couldve been an off night .
their bread is fabulous the chocolate bread is probably my favorite great for brunch went with a large group and had a blast want to go back soon .
service on a wed evening was very slow it seems like they were understaffed drinks are outstanding the food was ok nothing great small portions overcooked smoked pork chop and the duck was bland i wish the menu had  appetizers .
twitter update .
this could be a really great place if the waitress had not completely ruined my experience she was rude and horrible to deal with what a shame because they have a really nice bar and good food .
the food here is fantastic i was here with about 4 people each of us got a different dish and appetizer and everything was great bouillabaisse get it also when i went i was sitting next to the      from  .
also wrote them an email that night and never got a reply finally got a reply but they just dont get it .
 gras and oysters in the afternoon at the zinc bar are sublime the bar staff is so personable and the place really makes me feel like i could be in paris i hit this spot every time i am in new york which is never enough .
hip atmosphere in the bar area not as cool in the back dining room loved the short rib gnocchi yum dont order the pork meatballs no flavor .
great european style bistro type restaurant reminds me most of the belgian type of dining rather than french great steak frites and the service tries hard i will be going back to learn a bit more of this place .
just not that good .
food was excellent service was great but not pretentious all in all a great meal go for the seafood tower if you are feeling ambitious and your wallet is feeling heavy .
struggling to find anything good to say about the place everything from the food to the service and ambience was about a c .
expensive to the point of being a bit overpriced at breakfast but outstanding food coffee and service stop at the bakery for a quick breakfast well worth the walk down canal .
service was terrible disinterested and surly and we were clearly not regulars and thus not all that important the food was average italian at best maybe we caught a bad night based on the other reviews but it was a really bad night .
like a traditional upscale french resto in  just in nyc instead excellent food good service .
good brunch alternatives within walking distance of ants pants café lutecia resurrection ale house day by day .
nice stop in after shopping in soho sitting at the bar enjoying mussels with rich sauce and a glass of wine very good service and beautiful atmosphere .
a friend convinced me that this place wasnt as bad or expensive as i remembered she was wrong my fish tacos were stone cold fell apart at the slightest touch tasted like cardboard my guest wouldnt take more than one bite of his meal .
the napolean was the bomb thx  for getting these .
waste of time slow service mediocre food i only went because i received a gift card i dont plan on returning .
this is a great bistro the food is delicious especially the oysters and steak tare tare the pomme frites are delicious and the hangar  was yummy definitely a favorite .
every time i am in here im amazed at how rude the cashier is and how indifferent the servers are food is overpriced menu is not exciting or original .
this french bistro is a true original a true new york culinary experience walking in the door is like walking back in time the food is always great open for breakfast brunch or dinner .
place is no good pan fried noodles are like uncooked ramen and meat is mostly bone so many better places around made me feel like not being adventurous in places to eat .
 at its best pastries are good too .
disappointing cant understand the good reviews at yelp the small restaurant is clean but the food wasnt tasty at all the service was not really good the guests were all typical  that believed in the reviews .
ordered the steak frites medium with  sauce and they were delicious came here on a weekend and the place was full but im not complaining it had a parisian ambiance which made the meal memorable .
i asked the waiter what the places was known for and he said the ngow nam beef stew wonton noodle soup so i had the ngow nam ho fun the beef was tough and rice noodles not special .
best french onion soup ive ever had .
since i got there the waiter had such a nasty attitude then there was a peace of plastic in my dumpling soup and when i told him about it he got mad i thought i was being part of a joke unfortunately not this place is just terrible .
great food the french toast is amazing and the bouillabaisse is delicious .
2 5 stars half star below ok .
this place was great but it wasnt just about the food the service was great the feel was great it was more than just good food it was an experience i recommend it .
do not order take out from here i put my order in through yelp 1 hr later when i called the restaurant they said they are not going to deliver and hung up on me several times absolute truth this place deserves to be shut down .
the best niçoise salad in town hands down also fantastic for oysters and champagne served up in a traditional environment with beautiful decor and great light never disappoints .
unfriendly service all dishes we ordered was just ok a small bowl of rice cost 7 one of the most expensive bowl of rice i have even seen .
love it also love the side shop with all the delish breads best part is come after a certain time and everything is 12 off not bad  the olive bread .
absolutely no service of any kind probably too popular and no need for customers we turned away cause did not get any attention from the staff also no credit cards accepted today .
it was long wait one hour for sunday brunch but worth it goat cheese onion tart was heaven very soft flavorful filling and crispy tart scrambled egg in puff pastry was perfect could taste every layer of pastry with fluffy egg bon  .
i went there for lunch and ordered one of the shanghai noodle soups with pork and wontons it was all pretty bland i wont be back its not bad but its not really worth your time .
i will never forget my first balthazar experience as i have never left a restaurant feeling so full in my entire life everything from the bread to the dessert was amazing i had the short ribs entree and it was delicious the profiteroles are a must for dessert .
came here drunk after a night out and woke up with diarrhea ordered a sesame chicken and the broccoli was still cold they only take 2 credit cards per bill .
we were here for the seafood and tried le  a  seafood platter and i have to say it doesnt get much better than this in nyc .
stuck to their more popular dishes and i would give flavor and quality a d would not recommend .
ive come here on several occasions for their beer and fries interesting selection of beer and amazing fries will keep coming back .
food was so so many chinatown restaurant can offer similar quality of food however the service is extremely poor the waiter  full 15 tips despite i given 10 due to their poor and rude service .
exquisite service special occasion breakfast on a chilly morning or lunch sitting the bar balthazar never disappoints my favorite place to ear in manhattan .
there was something funky about all the meat we tried here and the broth of the soup was between bland to gross there must be better places to get these dishes in chinatown .
fabulous we go whenever we are in nyc love this place .
bad  food water with no ice in mid summer rude and slow service i was charged tips you decide if you want to come here .
i love the food here but it is not an intimate place its so loud and busy u might get panic attack here its that crowded but food is really good .
meh im asian so i know how the authentic wonton should taste like the flour was too thick for my liking and the flavour just wasnt there nonetheless the servers are nice and helpful but i wont ever go there again .
this is my fave place to eat in new york brilliant food great service and lovely decor love it .
disappointing not the best wonton noodles it was mediocre and you can definitely find better much better perhaps even across the  door .
i wish this place wasnt so crowded but its just so good fabulous fun place for brunch in soho .
cheap but bad food is ok but nothing good service is very bad you have to ask for everything you never get a smile and rarely a word .
we miss you .
i didnt understand what all the good reviews were about youve got to be extremely drunk if you think this place has great tasting food or you have to be new to  chinese food .
very beautiful indoor design and good quality food .
dont understand why the rating are high msg filled soup and mandatory tip for party of two never come back here table is sticky .
the one restaurant in new york that i love going back to the seafood tower is a must drink heavily cause they make the drinks good go late to try avoid the crowds just a great dining experience .
you get what you pay for most of the time the food was just okay for all three of us service was slow to start but then the food came out all at once i wouldnt go back .
onion soup in balthazar 55 onion soup from balthazar to go 25 .
meh we stopped in because of the good reviews unfortunately the food was just okay perhaps im just not  enough but nothing we had would bring me back well the hot tea was very good .
awesome and very busy plus noisy get ready to be pushed around but like it hehe .
service was quick and food was decent the general tso chicken left something to be desired too much breading and not enough chicken both fried rice dishes were average but tasty the fried wonton had a tiny sliver of shrimp better options exist in chinatown .
a night at balthazar is a night like no other the ambiance is so alive and for that not to mention the really superb food i try to go here every time i visit nyc .
why go here when you can go to big wong across the street the atmosphere here is  than the fast paced big wong the food and waiters pale in comparison just cross the street .
let me  by saying ive only been here once for coffee and dessert coffee delicious dessert  delicious ambiance french bistro esque bonus .
called four times for reservation for 7 persons and they couldnt be bothered to return my call so thanks for nothing the derby i will assume your food sucks .
the ambient is nice and welcoming the food is very good i recommend the steak .
grabbing a quick bite on a thursday my fish was full of bones all the soda was flat the bathroom was  disgusting never going back here .
loved this place came in on a saturday around 1pm and surprisingly was seated within 10mins had the trout salad which was one of the best salads ive ever had in my life the atmosphere is interesting also great place .
nice venue friendly waitstaff drinks and meals came out at random clearly still  things out in the kitchen drinks were heavily  towards sweetness food was bland interpretations of southern standards adding mushrooms on to a flavorless chicken fried steak doesnt help .
food and drinks were great really recommend this place .
while its a pretty bar and fancy looking the food is bland and service is lacking the food came out before the drinks and even they were poorly made also they refused to substitute on the already small menu as well as my undercooked patty melt .
really good lunch here lively atmosphere and reminiscent of a bistro in paris loved my steak tartar the moules frites were excellent had  pastis as a starting aperitif a nyc favorite .
i came here because of the yelp reviews i had ordered the burger and pulled pork the pulled pork had way too much sauce on it the burger was average but a lot better than the pulled pork .
love the food and the restaurant gotta come grab a bite if you happen to be in the soho area .
boy that was one salty burger .
my whole meal was delicious homemade fettuccine fries caramelized banana ricotta tart must come back for their pastries .
this place lacks the class that their prices ask for the food is soso and the price point is way out of line ive had the best this falls short of the rest .
fantastic restaurant great service classic atmosphere and delicious food for starters definitely try the warm goat cheese and caramelized onion tart and the french onion soup the entire menu is fantastic and youll find yummy treats in the bakery as well .
tried  kachori with aloo bhaji this has been the worst kachori i ever ate will not come here again or recommend someone to visit this place .
a bit too loud but the food was awesome and the service was great .
very bad place rude people work in there and food is just  it f up your stomach and appetite very dam expensive for the price and the quality of food is just now rite .
i love that you can come here for lunch and get delicious frites waffles and wine portions were generous and the server was quite nice it truly is a good place to people watch or  after a long morning of shopping .
stopped going there some fried items tasted old refried the guy at the counter is very creepy he is the main  for not going there again .
a bit spendy and overrun by tourists been eating here for years am i still one anyways salade niçoise and steak frites are classic .
terribly bad do not go here bad stale chaat  and  sour yellow  bought today and sincerely regret doing so need to report this  .
big  loud crowded fun for groups not so fun for dates brunch menu was on the pricey side but the grilled brook trout was delicious and the apple tarte tatin for dessert was just perfect .
the food was strictly ok too pricey for the kinda dishes they serve charged me 4 for a can of thumbs up their veggie burger platter is quiet big and filling but seems like a frozen and not freshly prepared patty .
legendary ambiance a tad pricey .
its just average indian food i didnt mind the food but for what i got how long it to get the food and for the price it was not worth it many better options in the area though .
i love it make reservations if you have the foresight we were unable to get reservations but walked in we were able to sit within 15 mn .
decent place full bar is nice the food isnt the best i think the appetizers are just microwaved pizza was okay but not somewhere i would recommend to a friend .
excellent all around two must trys from the brunch menu the balthazar salad and the beef stroganoff both amazing be prepared to wait .
worst pizza ever had a sad excuse for a margherita pizza it was dry not saucy and had old globs of mozzarella service was slow waitress was nice but took way too long for just about everything the order the grub and the check wont be coming back .
great eggs benedict but id say the place is bit on the pricier side .
pizza is bland never been happy with the food here .
great french place tight space but so fun to eat at i had the eggs benedict loved it and i love eggs  my go to brunch item very speedy service too .
update the service is still horrible brunch on sunday took 2 hrs .
it is a bit expensive but the food and the ambient is nice .
price is very good the taste is average i wouldnt really recommend this place kimchi fried rice is not as i expected .
went for dinner got seated quickly loved the place .
i got sick after eating their  food its really cheap and great for quick meal and i also know that their selection is various but i really think that they should care more about the food .
closest to paris ive had in the states food excellent for any meal staff is attentive and friendly saw  himself    and wife one afternoon as well as princess  star   .
do not get the beef with brown rice it taste like it has been there longer then my grandpa has been alive .
my favorite place in new york always excellent very authentic too a must .
the food is sitting in little   and under lights buffet style the sauces are dried up the kimbap is dry u pay for what u get .
good hot chocolate .
it exists to get you drunk near karaoke bars with enough chairs to sit all your friends just  your expectations this has all the atmosphere of a middling high school cafeteria but has cheap soju in vast quantities .
 soy latte 1 flakey buttery  the perfect start to a long day of shopping in sunny soho .
not as good as before everything taste the same now i came here last time the food was harder to bit and chew on price is a little bit higher also the box is  .
whether you are going there for a special dinner or just passing by for your morning croissant and cafe you will be delighted with the satisfaction you find here .
overrated had spicy boneless chicken and shrimp broccoli dumplings both were terrible i love korean food but this isnt a good place for it chicken was sugary and stale with more skin than chicken dumplings were just gross at least its cheap .
great ambiance for a large group excellent service and overall i was the only person slightly disappointed in my meal out of 6 and with the steak frites surprisingly ill give them a pass on a undercooked piece of steak since everything else was perfect .
meh after those  4 star reviews this is what you are about extremely disappointed the buffet was cheaper than most places but you look at the food and you know why its cheaper mehh .
great food must have reservations otherwise expect a 1 hr wait the cool wealthy soho crowd and probably the  restaurant in the area .
the food is cold and there is definitely not enough seats not much else i can really say about this place they do have a special if you check out the fridge area discounted  dishes from probably the day before or early in the day .
everytime im back i try to hit this wonderful place good vibes and great atmosphere the staff are great and very attentive and fun always great food including the bread and desserts and always memorable .
food for those on a budget or looking to  satisfy korean food cravings .
only way to do this place and not be overrun by tourists is 2am on a weekend get the oysters best in the city .
we were a little disappointed had korean for the first time the last time we were in nyc and loved it not sure if we just had the wrong thing .
one of my fave in the city great atmosphere great cocktails amazing food breakfast lunch and dinner you cant lose .
the place is small and cramped sometimes you cant seats to sit the food doesnt taste like the real korean food the price is acceptable the food is already cooked and done and put into a container this store gives off a feeling of seven eleven .
on  time here very busy for lunch on a monday other the same thing  delicious of course that i will return on my next trip to ny .
cheap tasty korean food but i found a huge roach crawling on one of the tables in the back the last time i went no thanks .
soooooo good perfectly executed comfort food in a cool setting with a french vibe go for any meal of the day .
i just dont seem to have a palate for korean food but friends seem to enjoy the food on budget .
had the best new years day lunch today incredible goat cheese and carmelized onion tart grilled salmon over phenomenal polenta and the lemon desert which totally hit the spot i love the people watching ambiance and energy no matter how busy it got the service was impeccable .
this place was just bad i was give it a zero if i could dirt cheap but bad greasy and without flavor i was sad there is definitely better korean and there is definitely better cheaper eats .
mjs star 3 5 price egg benedict 18 coffee 4 weekend brunch menu   except tax tip .
a lot of the food at the buffet are dry inedible the korean people that works there laughed in my face when i complained .
incredible eggs  i was just really impressed by the quality of the salmon and perfection of the poached eggs combined with mimosas and the company of my little sister at the bar breakfast was certainly served til 1130am to boot .
ive been coming here since  and over the years it really has deteriorated the japchae now is filled with onions instead of real ingredients pretty lazy cooking pricing for the quality of food you get its a major disappointment the food is tasteless and bland .
adding a star for the eggs norwegian which are arguably the best in the city surprisingly much better than at pastis be sure to snag your brunch reservation early if you dont have an in .
i was disappointed with the kimchee fried rice i had such high expectations and for a place so highly reviewed i was hoping for the best we also came at night which maybe explains the lack of freshness in the foods we ate .
what can i say that hasnt been said already this is a nyc institution for a reason treat yourself a great place to meet up with people after shopping in soho fresh bakery is really the cherry on top or maybe im just another tourist gasp .
mediocre reminded me a a 5 china buffet back home except its not all you can eat and its not 5 00 there were noodles and soups and sushi that i didnt get around to trying and maybe theyre worth a better review .
glowing  of paris dreamy tasty simple comfort food that invites intimacy and  i am always satisfied and never stuffed perfection at any hour of the day .
no aside from the kimbap and the  something is seriously wrong with the taste of the food here i dont care how cheap or convenient something is not right .
4 stars for an awesome raspberry and fresh fig tart i will let the good  but dry lemon  go this time .
the bartender is aloof and insanely rude food looks overpriced 21 for a rigatoni bolognese dont bother go down the street to  better food and better service now i can see what the place is usually empty .
wow how could i have let this one slip through my mind i went here about a year ago and i love love love the decor and totally fell in love with the banana  dessert totally going there again soon .
love that we have shabu shabu here now but the the broth was seriously lacking flavor also i tasted no difference between the original broth and spicy broth even though you pay more for the spicy one .
amazing brunch order the 12 bread basket so yummy very noisy crazy busy place but the food makes you forget about it ill be going back thats for sure maybe for dinner next time around .
sorry this is just not shabu shabu and the frozen  def not my favorite the decor is nice and something new but they really need to step up a notch on the soup base and the frozen seafood not to mention my fish ball was still frozen .
loved the whole roasted chicken and veggies cute ambience great for a sexy dinner date .
this was the first time i have ever been disappointed with hot pot on a positive note the prices were very reasonable and the  were decent hopefully theyll get better over time .
yum great atmosphere everything was really fresh and tasted delicious the creme brulee was probably the best ive ever had i will definitely be back oh and if dinner was good enough having   walk by my table was an added bonus she is so beautiful .
i made the mistake of ordering from here as neither the wife or i felt like driving to our normal spot the pizza was dripping with grease and lacked flavor overpriced as well that is what we get for being lazy .
stopped in  on a food tour to try the chocolate chip cookies as well as the oatmeal cookies both were fantasic this little bakery is attached to the balthazar restaurant both were packed with loyal patrons .
as an  bacon fan i came here super excited but was sorely disappointed the bacon was just a hard flat thing not juicy or anything like yelp says meh ive experienced better sorry barbacon i had high hopes for you you failed me .
really good steak frites the steak was excellent i also stop for coffee every so often in the morning on the way to work and it is aok .
tried the barbacon bahn mi should be taken off the menu bacon was too hard did not go well with the rest of the ingredients and overall disappointing will have to try something else next time .
excellent desserts try them all .
my 2nd time here our waiter seemed to disappear eventually the bartender noticed our table and another were being ignored and came over but he was covering the crowded bar i took forever to get a another drink and our check not going back .
loved it food is great .
terrible service inattentive waitstaff cocktails are all ice no drink do not waste your money here .
believe the hype .
although the food at this restaurant is good if you like pork the staff has a bit of an attitude the folks who take the reservations are completely messed up i would only go back for happy hour but you need to get there early .
great ambience amazing food nice bartenders beautiful people .
a fun novelty place to go but overpriced for what it is and poor service to boot we got our food 10 mins before we got our drinks .
with over 400 reviews they certainly dont need mine so ill be quick simply an amazing dining experience food was traditional french and the atmosphere is outstanding loved this place loved the people watching .
the food is ok i ate here twice and neither time was the food memorable the place itself is cute but its so cold in there  was a great waitress .
possibly the best meal ive had in nyc in years i always thought this place was a lot of hype my meal skate was sublime simple yet not so delicious i cannot even over state it .
i wasnt impressed by anything here music is too loud drinks are too expensive and the food is mediocre .
went here for brunch and enjoyed the brioche french toast service was quite good .
horrible service the girls there are nasty when answering the phone too over priced for not so great food i stopped going there .
crazy good eggs benedict and breakfast pastries .
im very very disappointed with all the food we had home made pasta veal osso  never tasted so worst italian food never go back again .
a french classic both as bakery and restaurant just as good for brunch as diner and classic timed environment balthazar has all you would expect from a classy bistro highly recommended .
we ate the special bottomless pasta dish nothing special .
delicious baked goods love this place for brunch great chicken liver and onions great consistent atmosphere when im back in my old  grounds .
never again this place is awful they are very very busy and the quality of the food and service has gone way down i will not be back also rude front of the house .
best steak frites steak fries with sauce  ive ever had in nyc never cared to try anything else setting with is wild and full of energy a must for a friday night in soho .
i have tried this place two years in a row  nothing special about it the food is not authentic italian the seating and customer service are okay however it doesnt deserve the 4stars rating at all .
in one word fantastic food is great and the decor flawless even though service is sometimes unnecessarily snobby and i do not use that word often visit and visit again i promise you wont be disappointed .
the pasta was so bland how is it that a supposed celebrity chef could serve such tasteless food at her restaurant these days as long as you have a tv show people will just flock to your restaurant regardless of quality .
eating here is like being friends with an old movie star sure the limelight is now  on some younger  star but all the  still lives with the classic my recommendation be a lady who lunches eat with friends late in the day and drink wine .
this place is way over rated we had the pasta special and honestly not worth the wait or the money the staff is great but the food is more like franchise resturant .
what a great place delicious breads excellent well prepared food had brunch here and loved it by far the most excellent server amazingly polite patient and attentive we all fell a little bit in love with him  oh   sat beside us tres cool .
overrated crowded .
still a great place to have lunch the service was great had a fantastic bottle of wine moules frites a rare burger and a tarte tatin a little loud but hey thats the ambiance nearly perfect .
poor service  was over cooked very chewy flavorless and had lots of fat and sinew pork chop was very dry decent beer and wine selection .
i love balthazar the food drinks and service are very good it is a perfect combination of tasty food and reasonable price for a fancy restaurant .
came here before a party once so wanted to get lots of pasta in the stomach beforehand we had the pasta tasting and i thought it was pretty bland however wine was surprisingly inexpensive would come here again to just drink and get a few apps .
best mojitos in manhattan damn straight .
just ok nothing memorable the price was decent for nyc .
have been a longtime patron the food is always consistent the staff  the atmosphere is a little  a lot of business is  here as well as a place to see and be seen .
 3 unlimited pastas of the day was undercooked and ive definitely had much better otherwise disappointed .
yep there is a reason why there are over 400 reviews for this place keep up the great work balthazar we love your food and enjoy your brunch .
the pasta were inedible the 22 for the dinner special would have been a great value otherwise .
great food in a lively atmosphere loved the clams steak frite and creme brulee perfect location to shop all day and then sit and enjoy an excellent meal at times it can get a bit too noisy though overall a place to return especially if im nearby .
tables are  too close together this is my second time there and both times i felt as though i needed more space food was okay nothing great would not go back again .
love the  food was good service was good and fast make your reservation early or make sure you have plenty of time to wait for your table .
went here before seeing the  once the service was great the wine selection is robust and meets the needs of every possible price point however the food was just okay you get what you pay for .
the food was perfect the service was above average and the vibe in the place was unbeatable put it on your must do list when in nyc .
i wanted to like this place but it was average the service was decent the food was decent the feel of the place is probably the best thing it has going for it would not return .
stopped in for cocktails and oysters oysters were very fresh and cocktails were on point friends dine here  and enjoy it very much will have to stop by for a full meal next time .
had lunch today ok experience waiters were friendly food was not what we expected flavor profile of the meals just did not seem right disappointing experience would not try it again with so any great italian options out there .
i was very happy with the bread basket thats all that i really care about good bread fresh bread lovely bread pretty bread good bread yumm thinking about that perfectly poached eggs benedict .
some elements of our meal were ok but the majority of it lacked flavor the  with bolognese sauce was very good though and the waitstaff were very attentive .
my spirit  every time i bite into their almond croissant .
ok experience packed you in like sardines very loud party of 10 next to us could not no even hear ourselves or waiter slow service only catered to large party food ok couples on both sides of us also were very unhappy .
great french bistro and the scene is  as well try the scallops and an after dinner drink at the  room down the street m .
not even worth writing a review about  is much better .
good for a big group food and drinks are good lil pricey .
i hated this place please see xanga comfeedmoonbunny… for why i do have pictures of the food but i refuse to post them because the food looks great but tastes horrible .
ummmm doughnuts and the croissants are amazing .
came out fast tasted good but i have to admit i was a little disappointed who charges 13 for a salmon eggs benedict and serves up one egg and no toast what is this .
done to death with 300 reviews what can i add memorable decor and high quality bistro fare make for great meals and  conversation  brunch lunch or dinner are all well served at balthazar oh agreed its seriously busy .
super expensive upscale coffee joint serving lunch sandwiches and salads as well as the usual pastries great coffee by the way .
we stopped by to pick up some pastries the chocolate and lemon  are full of flavor and so buttery tasty the pumpkin cheesecake was perfect a smooth creamy texture with an amazing flavor .
a bit of a letdown mainly due to the rave reviews posted on yelp our meal was very average really nice people and good service but dated vibe and uninspired cooking really expected to and wanted to like this place more .
love this place for brunch the pastries the coffee the eggs benedict oh my i am in love please note your reservation will not be honored until you entire party has arrived .
website and yelp list incorrect business hours they are actually closed every afternoon went miles out of my way to try this place and they were closed because someone is too stupid to put the proper business hours online .
amazing steak frites and banana caramel ricotta souffle loves it .
food is ok service horrible waiter put in wrong order and my husband did not get his food for over an hour till he decided to cancel his order then they said it was ready lol .
after so many years still great atmosphere attentive waiters and french to boot washington oysters out of this world and absolutely delicious steak  and the au poivre excellent too cooked to perfection .
its ok nothing more than that i thought the quality of ingredients was good but the flavor itself is bland the service was excellent .
great french brasserie you will see there the most famous people from new york this is the place to be on the weekend for lunch if you want to be seen .
had a sandwich there today and it was ok but it wasnt what i ordered no one over 21 works there and it didnt seem very clean .
another staple on my annual new york trip we come here for lunch while shopping in soho it is delicious every time the staff is friendly and they have amazing french onion soup and french fries it does get crowded but its well worth the wait .
i like the place nice ambience and food but there was only tap water no option to buy a bottle of water and they dont have  water was dying of thirst and no clean water .
great breakfast the best chocolate  in the city its tough to get a table on the weekends particularly for brunch but if you can snag one you wont be disappointed .
gave ew another shot with my roommate and again wasnt too impressed took about 15 minutes for our drinks to arrive to our tables their burger was absolutely mediocre and they overcooked the mediumrare i requested .
the atmosphere here is so happy and beautiful its just like you would think soho would be like the belgian ales dont hurt either .
i was  by the reviews and decided to try this place well i was fairly disappointed even though i was starving the bread was dry and i didnt find anything spectacular about the rest of the ingredients maybe my expectations were too high .
killer breakfast and lunch yes its crowded but if youre flexible and willing to eat at the bar or at one of the bar tables youll be well rewarded weekday breakfast scene is nothing short of downtown  central .
pretty awful the pluses ok space  tried very hard to please quiet the minuses my food the onion soup was bland mussels were luke warm not hot .
i had my first taste of a french  here however you spell it its a very classy french place to me there is like no room to barely stand if you go after work though .
i used to love this place so much but once i received a lovely case of food poisoning i could no longer eat here sorry guys .
the steak frites were very good it was worth a splurge the atmosphere is very romantic and fills your appetite for french cuisine  the dont offer crepes of any form or  which would make it very authentic french cuisine .
overly sweet sushi rice if you like that i do not fluorescent  tuna was not desirable yellowtail was on its way out vacant flavored green tea perhaps i caught them on a bad day the miso soup was a treat though .
i love balthazar everything is amazing but please order the steak frites you will not be disappointed come to balthazar for brunch lunch dinner bring your girlfriends your date your parents or all of the above its one of those perfect nyc restaurants .
just ok americanized not enough flavor .
i was here once my  doesnt cover this place but the food was delicious .
we have been here 2 times and this will be the last .
a little bit of a wait consider we have appointment with them a bit hyped but the food was good and they still serve a large group of us water after we finish our breakfast .
you dont post your beer prices you dont get my business .
two words eggs benedict o m g absolutely to die for great place to have brunch with company reservations are definitely needed before arrival sidenote this is a review for their breakfastbrunch i dont know how dinner is like here .
saw this place on diners  and dives and really wanted to like it fried pickles were good but my pork sandwich was way over salted and bland all around fish chips were soggy and also over salted .
great food cramped seating but a   sighting had to be the  a must when in nyc .
if you want to go to a bar where the bartender  in your face when you ask about a drink then this is the place personally id rather be at a bar where i feel welcome and not insulted when i order a drink .
 balthazar .
somethings  here these people are clearly reviewing dmitris at 3rd and  while this page clearly says  at 225 s  st which ive never heard of yo people wtf .
great brasserie that really  the essence of soho ny awesome brunch menu always a fan of beet salad extensive dessert and wine menus pleasant albeit not the fastest service cant add much more to whats been said .
food is good but the service has always been a bit brusque and cold unfortunate as i live across the street and would love to make this place a regular .
food is always fantastic and i love the hustle bustle and energy of this place ive had many a power lunch here and they always prove to be a success so maybe im biased that its lucky .
wouldnt take reservations for 2 and told me to show up at 7 or earlier and we would be seated right away showed up at  and there was a 45 min wait ill be sure to tell everyone not to go here know your business .
you know service is good if theyre still refilling your glass with water well after youve paid your bill food was great i recommend the eggs norwegian if you like smoked salmon  .
poor service they let customers smoke around us hot dessert came cold they were pushy about the bill .
very good place to eat service could be a little better they know how famous their place is so they dont really care but the food is good and its the place to be seen if youre into that kind of thing .
would have given you 4 stars except for the hostess hostess would seat you first if flirt with her seen this happen a few times but dont get me wrong food was good and reasonably priced i would go back only when the hostess is not around .
i give 3 stars for the food and extra star for the service on a busy week night dinner was not rushed and incredibly affordable .
had a terrible experience with the owner and management of this place the food can be decent but the management is atrocious there are many many other better places than this in the city just not worth getting mistreated .
good place for a late night meal or even an early meal or just a meal just feels like how a new york brasserie should .
nice atmosphere and inexpensive you are getting what you pay for food not great just ok service ok .
ive been twice for breakfast both times i got eggs benedict one of my favorite breakfast dishes they were  both times its a bit noisy and crowded in there but the food is worth it .
not a comment on the food called to confirm a reservation for a large group for a birthday party they did not have my reservation booked 2 weeks in advance and did not offer any accommodation would not recommend for large groups .
sundays  espresso sunday ny times at balthazars im a happy man .
i ordered the tagliatelle although homemade it was bland the sauce was mediocre i was bored by two bites i was really looking forward to this place from all the great reviews but honestly i will not try this place again .
this might be the location of choice for   types to grab a power breakfast  route from the  on prince and  to their soho offices but that doesnt mean the food isnt  good and the cappuccinos dont forget those .
service was slow and it was not even crowded server in bar was bitchy slow and nonexistent food was barely fair first and last time here .
lunch was onion soup  by that   of gruyere it nearly knocked me over a decent beet salad with remarkably soft  of  and a  red then i went shopping in my  beef broth  ale  best day ever .
went there sunday lunchtime and it was closed their website has sunday hours though may be well be able to try some other time .
too lovely for words steak frites yum but obnoxious waiter who obviously thinks all english people are idiots which is why they lose a star other than that a wonderful experience .
these people need to buy a bloody wine cooler buy a bottle of red and its above room temperature more like warm and gross .
one of my favorites in the entire  beautiful food people and entertainment eat at 10 stay till 4 stumble home .
22 for 5 tiny scallops dont waste your time those scallops should have been on the appetizer menu very nice bartender and okay vibe too bad the overpriced food ruined the experience .
 dinner  place with great pommes frites and with the matching atmosphere to boot not as  and us  as it used to be but still has not lost its  and noise this place gets damn loud .
i think the quality of the food is good but it is terribly overpriced .
shop people watch in the village then relax for some good eats and great bar this place has a parisian feel a little rag time nice order a martini and  .
arrived hungry left almost as hungry thats how small the portions were cant think of a worse way to  your customers .
rainy sunday morning steamy windows hot coffee and an amazing brunch that had me staying till lunch then dinner the perfect french bistro .
i dont think it was good it was rather blend and lacked refinement i dont think i will go ahead nice environment though nice crowd however the food is not up to par which is for me the most important .
not so bad for brunch i recommend the waffles and berries but its pretty expensive so be ready to spend .
the concept of the  burger was great the execution was poor the burger was over seasoned and over cooked the fries were reminded me of lunch room fries with some cheese and jalapeño the pork belly was good cant go wrong with pork belly .
the food is fantastic the chicken riesling is to die for unfortunately for me im just a  art student so it is on the expensive side the next time im in new york i have to go back again .
slow service incredibly slow and disorganized food was fine nothing incredible .
excellent french food even the creme brulee was exceptional by european standards good atmosphere and good crowd of people went there for a wedding anniversary and the wife loved it .
not my  tea .
one of my favorite  in nyc very parisian style the food is excellent and staff is really nice i love the  and the pomme frittes prices were reasonable and a great wine list the place is always packed and can be little loud .
stepped in on a cold night for a cup of chocolate for my girlfriend who was home for 6 00 received a tiny portion togo cup of average tasting hot chocolate although  bitter it was pretty tasteless also no offers of whip cream etc .
one of those restaurants where you truly feel like you are  on a dining experience crowded well known and well loved the most happening spot for brunch in soho try it out and expect a wait .
dont believe the hype while the staff is nice the menu and wine list dont love up to the reputation skip dinner grab a seat at the bar and have a cocktail and  .
amazing place great service from the bartender despite the extremely crowded place i think her name was jin she was very attentive to my group and i and always made sure we were okay the drinks were also delicious and the music couldnt be better .
plates too tiny and not so many choices dont go there if youre hungry disappointment for us .
dragon wings is very addictive all bartenders and  are nice but they sometimes have trouble when they are packed great old school hip hop bar in nyc .
seated people in front of us who were simply pushy avoid the wait and go to the little owl or commerce they are both way nicer also definitely overpriced you will spend the same amount at the little owl .
great music old  hip hop cool people delish food veggie yum yum gin holds downs the bar and i simply love this place and would  out here 7 days a week nuff said come  some .
i could probably do without the  french accents but  does a mean breakfast pastries are a safe bet and though the poached egg seemed more like some variation of  the veggies its  over are delicious in typical european fashion no skim milk 2 5 .
love this place free coat check great bartenders and staff food during happy hour is awesome two words bulgogi fries .
this was the worst turkish food i have ever eaten i sent my plate of lamb  to the trash will never waste my meal or money there ever again horrible would not recommend .
good music and good chicken  .
the service is bad .
came here for happy hour with a girl friend we thoroughly enjoyed our lychee martini and lychee mimosa the pork buns were a tasty  yum .
nothing special kinda of a tourist trap .
must go for happy hour drinks and dancing .
 prices soso food eatable but not delightful service well meaning but  presentation leaves many aesthetic  behind roof top view wasted with slow service demand to  credit card when ordering .
drinks arent watered down crowd is great and so is the music for the times that i was there very small space however and no seating so it does get fairly stuffy and hot in there .
i wish i could put a 5 star rating this restaurant is beautiful and the food is amazing my experience was ruined by the terrible service we received our waiter ignored us it seemed like we were an after thought and it really is a shame .
if you love hip hop classics and great people this is the best bar on the lower east side .
 across the board we went for hand pulled ale it was not what we expected having been to england many times they were out of 3 other drafts is this a british pub that doesnt have any british beer try  down the street .
my favorite bar in the east village the music food and staff are great also if you love hip hop look no further pork buns and mongolian beef are a must as well .
this place is just ok food is decent but draught beer selection leaves a lot to be desired came in for a few pints was sat on a  at a table ugh and they were out of 2 of their 7 available beers on tap .
make reservation otherwise you dont get in thai food with a special touch we were in a different part with a table and  to sit in very spicy food .
i was so looking forward to the chicken pot pie i must have gotten a  one underneath the lovely  top were two tiny  of chicken a couple of small pieces of vegetable and a soupy sauce i left starving .
the dj on friday nights rocks the house the crowd is mixed and casual trendy the drinks are inexpensive and the vibe is chill  good times .
the food is disgusting i dont know how you can screw up chicken wings and a salad but this was the worst food ive had in a long time the wings were literally soggy the beers and ambience at the bar was okay though .
great place to hangout music was awesome 90s hip hop mostly been there twice and both times had a really good time we also tried the tapas and wings not bad for a casual hip hop night .
not sure what this place is trying to be a sports bar an upscale hangout a restaurant it tries to be everything to everyone also the drinks were too expensive when compared to the other places in the neighborhood .
this place rocks hip hop and top 40s all night on friday great drinks and staff theres a 5 cover after 11 i think there are a lot of ladies here too so get your game on fellas .
first time there and i asked for two plain pizzas to be well done but didnt get it the pizza wasnt great like other reviews say .
best wing spot ever you know its a true wing spot when they serve you wings and they dont give you a fork and knife who eats wings with cutlery try the dragon wings and the honey ginger garlic wings delish .
i always wonder why when a friend wants to eat here twice now in the past 6 months there are so many other options here that blow this chain away .
good apps fun drinks great vibe what more do you want .
the worst vanilla shake ever do they know to put syrup in it ice cream plus milk is not a shake it is ice cream and milk so disappointing zero stars on the shake .
excellent hh deals throughout the week hip hop music and bartenders who are mad chill .
the fries were cold and the shake tasted like pure sugar not strawberry ive had way better someone referred me here i think as a joke .
ask for jin shes awesome and  i believe his name is cute  guy theyre both bartenders and make strong drinks .
shake shack does not live up to its hype the burger was decent but nothing i would go out of the way for my chocolate shake was delicious and the fries were just frozen  cuts .
great music and reasonable drink prices but if you plan on dancing all night be prepared to sweat because it is way hot when there are a lot of people on the dance floor .
visited with my son he absolutely loved his burger and fries my burger however was totally raw on a good note i called the manager and he was apologetic and offered me a free meal should i return honestly not sure if i will ever return .
come here for the lychee martinis love the atmosphere can get really crowded so come earlier for happy hour and bar hop .
you are famous for your burgers and shakes ughh burger is so less than average and shake which i just got is making me sick dont waste your money and pick other burger place .
yay im a fan pork buns bomb as fck lychee martini  another please and the atmosphere is great if youre reading this and wondering if you should check this place out the answer is yes .
i ordered a  burger at shake shack an got a small patty on the ghetto potato bread you can buy at shoprite 12 for 3 19 the burger itself was alright but man this place is too expensive to be this bad .
awesome atmosphere great food and music love the central island bar and the dance floor is spacious great spot .
i could have gotten a cheeseburger off of mcdonalds dollar menu and a wendys frosty and saved myself the 10 difference would have tasted better too .
i loved this place and the next time i am in new york i will be back for sure the food is a bit spicy but i loved every bite but dont go just for the food the music is crazy oldschool hiphop at its best .
why is this place so popular fries are great but  burgers are no better than wendys .
good spot gets lively on friday nights and they have   nights of wednesdays once a month i think .
that was a 5 shake oh ok not sure what makes it worth 5 even my 11 year old child was underwhelmed and complained it was too thin disappointed .
i checked in to get my free high five and smile from the bar tender he kindly gave me 2 free shots the dj mix was amazing the scene was great ill remember this place for future events .
i was here about six weeks ago take out order they messed it up called and spoke to a friendly manager was told i would get something in mail that never happened i thought the shake was great the food was good .
very cool place for 20 and  great music dj always spinning in the back happy hour starts and ends at  new york hours too .
average expensive burger nothin special layout terrible will not return no thanks anything higher and one star is a lie .
i came here late on a sunday afternoon for a friends birthday and couldnt ask for a better experience the beer was good but the food and the staff was even better the bartender even gave the group of us a free round of birthday shots .
95 hype 5 substance i would take an in n out burger any day over this not trying to hate but i wonder how much of the  initial popularity is philly people trying to  jack manhattan .
place was very simple happy hour is great good place to kick your night off 4 stellas till 10 the food was good too small plates .
this place is overrated the burger is small poorly put together and costs too much .
lychee mimosa try it .
usually love pei wei but tonight my noodles were a bunch of mush almost the consistency of mash potatoes and they were not really busy but we had to wait over 40 minutes smh .
great food great service by  very attentive and friendly food was hot tasty and well presented .
service sucks brought out my meal before my soup place is empty def on the  soup was warm chicken salad was good though so was the ice tea dont see this place staying open for many more years at this pace .
love the music here drinks are good and strong also the food is pretty good just a tad salty overall would recommend it to anyone who wants to let loose and have a good time .
waited for food for 25 mins and then received uncooked chicken fried rice nice concept but poor  .
i go to fat  for the chill vibe and awesome djs they play a perfect mix of 90s rb and chill electro to add to the awesomeness the food and drink specials are a great deal .
ordered hot and sour soup and pad thai should be pretty easy for asia place waited for 20 minutes waitress was bringing the plate with her finger in the food hot and sour soup was cold and pad thai didnt have anything in common with pad thai .
the cheers of the ev and hot crowd cant beat the happy hour in nyc 4 well wine and select beer 7 pork soy or beef  wings  pm  you love fat buddha fat buddha loves you come play .
a small portion of food with  prices my dish tasted like burnt oil which was not very appetizing they need to do better .
i can walk to this spot get cray cray drunk and walk back home awesome .
free   ordered a pad thai got it to go waited 30 min whatever that means it is fresh fast forward later excited to dig in and eat it pad thai noodles no linguini i  nothing like the pei wei in  .
my cheers .
all i can say is i should know better the egg roll was greasy and doughy the steak with honey sauce was coated in a sauce so thick i couldnt taste the steak next time i want chinese food i will go to a chinese restaurant my bad .
awesome happy hour with strong 4 well drinks food is delicious but a little on the expensive side 12 for a small bowl of bulgogi and rice .
hmm i paid 17 for my husband and i to eat probably the worst meal i have ever had outside of my house dont waste your money .
strong martinis yes todiefor chili fries and homemade mayo yea baby cool music get out enough light for people watch or be watched  happy hour absolutely yep i am a fan more martinis please .
this location needs to increase its portion size the large was way to small compared to other pei wei restaurants i have been to they also need to add the thai dynamite and spicy korean flavors that you can get at other locations .
pretty good pork buns awesome music and really nice bartenders which is so rare in this city i went for the first time last night for the   and loved meeting  and the owner very chill place if you want to drop by on weekdays .
yuk what is this this is almost like a  asian fast food restaurant i had dan dan noodle the noodle was extremely starchy and sticky the sauce tasted like it came from a package it was gross any cheap chinese restaurant can beat this place never again .
fat buddha has awesome music incredible wings and solid drinks i came in for happy hour a few thursdays ago and had a blast the dj was on point and the sesame ginger wings were beyond description go try them .
every time ive been here the rice is a hard as rocks and i have to complain .
where do i begin this place was just plain awesome the finger foods were amazing i had the ginger wings and dragon fries dj rocked out with classic hip hop and rb songs the lychee martinis were amazing as well definitely will be back .
how can it possibly be a pei wei without the signature pei wei pad thai dishes very disappointed no wonder the line next door at chipotle is so long people cant find what they want at pei wei .
went here on a saturday night around 930 place was full by 10 very friendly bartenders good dj a surprisingly diverse mix of people drinks were very good and worth the 10 and they have kimchi backs in addition to pickle backs .
good fried food no question however for the cost the portions of clams are ridiculously small need to find another place for whole belly clams .
in ny on business and looking for a fun place food was good and they played great music .
terrible chewy no taste lobster roll barely any lobster for the price and on hamburger bun clams with bellies had no bellies disaster got our money back and left .
i love this place happy hour until 9pm great wings great dumplings and pretty solid service just dont sit in the front or else you will be forgotten fun place to go with friends pork buns suck by the way .
nothing special i had the fish and chips my husband had the shrimp and chips everything tasted like pure oil even though the fish was fresh i will not return they even charge you for extra tartar .
food go here for brunch its amazing i loved how they blend american brunch with asian flavors the drinks are even asian inspired atmosphere barlounge they service is good the dj is playing music while u eat breakfast lol .
isnt there a food safety law that requires the handling of cooked food like the shrimp they sell to be with gloves i was a little bit grossed out when they were using bare hands to handle the cooked shrimp in addition to credit cards  etc .
pleasantly surprised by this place we were the first reservation for saturday brunch and the food and service was great .
dreadful food has declined noticeably over the past several months we  most of our recent takeout as it was way too greasy and vegetables tasted rotten would not recommend at all too bad it used to be quite good .
music is great good crowd fun times food isnt all that but i can look past that for the atmosphere .
cons portions are ridiculously small felt ripped off check out my pic of 14 fish entree pros nice atmosphere food tastes ok not coming back here .
perhaps i was just drunk perhaps i was very hungry or perhaps i just didnt have any sort of high expectations for the food but boy i downed those beef slider buns like i was going to the chair clean and spacious space friendly bartenders would def return .
as with osteria it didnt really work for me noisy room ok its a brew  strange unappealing menu dont come here unless you really love meat everything i tried was oversalted did i mention that a casual dinner for four ran well over 200 .
ahmazing food was awesome dj was awesome location was awesome did i mention a saturday happy hour until 9 yes please reservations are pretty difficult to snag on a saturday but we got lucky i love fat buddha .
burnt lasagna burnt coffee .
the food here was good i personally love love the appetizers awesome the atmosphere was great it had a  ambiance to it the service was great and very attentive the drinks are really pretty and good too .
i was not impressed food was meh service was great ambiance lively and attractive .
went there for drinks and it was a good experience a nice selection of beer and other reasonably priced drinks the music was pretty loud but not obnoxious and ok as a conversation background friendly bartenders and clean comfortable atmosphere .
people behind counter have real attitudes and pizza taste similar to cardboard box 5 00 pizza not worth the arrogance .
whenever im here i have a great time the music is always fun and the bartenders treat you really well its also a fun place to catch a soccer game keep   .
tick tock tick tock waited a long time for our order to be taken tick tock tick tock waited a while for out food to come food was good but the wait is a bit much .
super tasty food nice staff always a pleasant experience .
first we werent served and when we were it was all burnt so went to allwood diner allwood is family friendly and gives take out .
the half price drinks til 9 lured me in to my surprise it actually had great food awesome music totally chill place to go for  n drink highly recommend it .
have been here 3 times in last few weeks since i am here for a 3  work project very disappointed in service staff is unfriendly food is average and pricey dissapointed .
music and vibe was awesome and the bartenders make great drinks does get pretty crowded so get there early to claim your territory .
way too expensive lack of items on menu dead on week days i could give a 100 reasons i will never return .
great place to start the night it isnt that big so come early for a bar space the food is great especially the pork sandwiches and the wings although they are very pricey for the portion size the music on most nights has been awesome .
used to be a favorite but the prices keep going up and service going down id rather go to nutley diner .
rainy tuesday night had a few drinks bartender was great drinks were perfect thats all i could ask for thank you i will be returning on a fri or sat .
ive been here several times over the last 10 or so years and ive seen this diner go down significantly the service is slow and poor and the quality of the food has gone downhill with so many better diners in nj i dont plan on coming back .
thanks fat buddha for showing me a fun time in ny wish there was a spot in ca like this i drank till the early morning and hurt much the next day haha bye .
first timer had breakfast here found 4 strings of hair in my  traffic jam supposedly one of signature dishes someone in the back had to mess with the order feeling sick with just the thought 1 star for food quality today but 5 stars for our waitress .
drinks ok didnt eat there but the atmosphere and music are dope good spot to let loose with a few drinks .
the food was too much for what they actually give you i ordered taylor burger the meat had no flavor at all the bread was completely soggy the waitress i had was very nice but the food disappointed .
good food great dj best bartender in the city p .
5 25 for a side of fries is absolutely ridiculous do they use the extra money to hire  .
i love this place the music rocks and the drinks are excellent prices are more than reasonable 10 cocktails you have to try the flying buddha drink sooooo good wish there was more place to dance .
terrible food terrible service im only giving one star because they took the lobster bisque off the bill which was totally inedible never going back again .
where else can you get red bull  dance and then order up some dim sum at 1am didnt really like the layout of the space but the bartenders were super nice and the dim sum was surprisingly delicious .
very disappointing ordered the lobster bisque and got imitation crab bisque  horrible this place is not what it used to be a victim of its own celebrity .
i had a great time here uber friendly staff and not as pretentious as other places in the area loved the lychee martinis and the dj was awesome everyone was dancing love fat buddha .
nothing special crappy service .
great staff great drinks great food must get is the sliders so goooood i can eat them all night lol .
very disappointing .
not only is the food awesome but the staff is super nice they had no problem with me bringing an outside dessert for a birthday dinner i really appreciated that .
this place is popular but not my go to diner food was decent except the cole slaw was stale good portions though and price was just right .
came here once only and i liked it music hiphop gets my  of approval adding to my list of no frills no hassle good music spots a la  bob etc crowd was on the young side free coat check .
yeah yeah gets all the press yet overpriced granted it is always open and at 3 am you could do much  .
in manhattan for 5 nights came here for 3 nuff said .
you walk in and you see the typical jersey diner the food is bland the service is good the place definitely leaves something to be desired there are too many diners around to choose this one bottom line go somewhere else please .
great food drinks staff are super friendly .
the food was terrible cold and got both my daughter and i sick within hours worse than that i couldnt even get a manager to speak with me after 3 days of calling this place is the worst place ive ever ate at period .
must have the sliders then must have anything lychee had fries wings and chicken bowl as well all pretty good but those are  if nothing appeals to your taste buds go for buddha he is chunky and  clearly he has no complaints .
nothing better then paying 16 for 2 bowls of chicken noodle soup with no chicken 2 sodas and toast pretty sure that goes against the concept of what a diner is supposed to be .
i did enjoy this place the sangria was amazing and so was the vegetable paella its extremely pricey for the neighborhood considering its in the ghetto of hartford .
totally misses the mark bland hot roast beef sandwich that would have put the  party off lunch just cause the waitress ends each statement with an affected hon does not a diner make .
the food here is excellent the service and staff are also exceptional always a pleasure to come here .
stale fries what diner cant make fresh french fries to go with your sandwich unacceptable the sandwich was horrible too .
yeah this is one of the best restaurants on hartford period they have fantastic seafood the only problem can be the wait time good wine list .
i used to have lunch or breakfast at this diner at least three times a week until i couldnt stand the nasty servers any longer management take note send your waitresses to charm school .
jamon  best ham ever never had a bad meal here everything is spectacular i cant complain and love bringing people here ambiance is classy yet fun atmosphere keeps you upbeat and enjoying everything service is impeccable awesome awesome restaurant a rare jewel in the south end .
i was served rotten sour cream rotten when i told the server she took it away and never brought anything new or apologized or anything at all things happen but how it was handled not handled was upsetting .
great place to have paella food was better before this last refresh of the menu it seems like flavors were  down a bit sangria is still good though .
not very good compared to the other local diners .
i feel like i am in  friendly owners and great chef have been going here when i am in the hartford area for years always consistent .
its right off route 3 stick with the regular diner selections of burgers and fries avoid anything pasta because the sauce isnt great its a good place after hours during the mornings after hanging out all night and getting soup or something for breakfast .
i love the food here the portions an be small though i ordered a simple chicken dish cant remember then name but it was flavorful and filling my friend had i believe a tuna dish and there wasnt much to it i enjoyed the atmosphere and service .
blandest food in the entire u s a these people dont understand that food can be cooked with salt and pepper much less onion or garlic the only good thing that i got there was the coffee which really was pretty good .
the food is so fresh and good and the prices are very fair we usually order in for delivery and the food comes hot and pretty quickly the pizza is a family favorite and the salads are really good too .
dry ribs too much mayo in the slaw chicken just hacked up not cut properly by section of the bird no sauce on ribs either i could have dried out ribs in my own oven for a lot cheaper .
love the rigatoni and vodka sauce great cesar salad too and you can get a glass of wine .
not impressed pulled pork was dry on a portuguese roll i love portuguese rolls but it just didnt work i got sides of rice and beans and not too much flavor there either the 3 side sauces were ketchup mustard and a watery bbq sauce sorry but sorry .
ive been going here since its inception theres never a a bad anything one of the best kept secrets in the area .
very disappointing shrimp in garlic sauce is flavorless and they use cheap tiny shrimp i ordered top sirloin medium rare but it was well done and tough not a happy camper .
my boyfriend and i love this place their food is consistently good we especially are obsessed with their vodka pizza and crostini  out of control how good it is yumm .
gotta be honest i had food here once an it was bland i mean very bland so i wasnt particularly pleased service was nice prices were decent but the food tasted like nothing personally ill pass .
ive been ordering takeout from this place for years and they are very consistent always extremely fast when i place an order i usually head right there and food is always ready friendly staff and quality food .
spinach and garlic in tin foil with no spice no thanks go for the noodles still not great the cameras over every table are comforting though .
the  pizza is the best in city my wife loves the pasta  always friendly service and prices are  with the quality of the food try the different  they have for dessert .
the hostess will and has ruined the whole experience once again i feel sorry for the waiter who served us due to her being rude i refused to leave a tip smh if i could put a half a star i would .
we got a couple large subs one ham and cheese one eggplant for a party they were ready on time tasted good and didnt cost an arm and a leg im sure well order food from them again in the future .
unless youre there for karaoke avoid this place for chinese food at all cost buffet type quality at gourmet prices the inside ambience reminds me of a  home .
we live near  and order their pizza all the time it is great the pizza is as good as any nyc pizza shop .
very skimpy portions dishes with chicken shrimp or beef are 90 vegetables sauces lack taste and they appear to all be from the same bottle i really wanted to like this restaurant but it was bad .
very nice dinners excellent wraps sandwiches great pizza something for everyone priced right too you can take the family and not need to get a  very comfortable atmosphere staff is excellent hustling hard working and very friendly especially lauren  ask for them .
this place has decent food but horrible service also the prices are outrageous 3 for a pizza slice that was tiny and 18 for spaghetti and meatballs ridiculous definitely not going back ever again .
great teriyaki chicken beef shrimp or selection of two tasty quick and inexpensive .
for princeton it is not overpriced but for anywhere else it is it is ok but not that great either it does seem to be where the townies go .
great teriyaki with fresh ingredients sushi price and quality could be the best deal here .
food was terrible ambiance and decor was good and cozy the bar seemed to be fun management acknowledged  our food went back to the kitchen because it was undercooked twice low quality ingredients some food items seemed stale hopefully not expired .
my go to for a quick bite 2 for 8  is my go to when i dont have time to sit for  this is a must go .
blah food was underwhelming and expensive for what was received has a pretty cool interior but bland food ensures that next time in princeton ill be going to get dinner someplace new .
love love love price was great and food was amazing my new fave lunch spot downtown .
this place is probably better for drinks and appetizers but i was in the area meeting up with an old friend so we chose  the salad was totally average the company was fantastic .
soon to be added to the list of downtown favorites quick convenient and clean not the  selection to choose from compared to its sister restaurants ginza and  but enough to satisfy the appetite with delicious food at a reasonable price .
good drinks decent food but the last time i went we saw a mouse in the dining area .
this is our second time here if you  you will pass it wednesday was cuban day and boy was it tasty very small no frills but the food is great .
ok not great burgers are good service so so a small step above fridays .
the paninis here are delish it is the perfect amount of size if you are hungry or looking to share a delicious hot snack with someone .
great beer selection if you like expensive  but there are no other options bar tender upstairs was cold and rude throughout the night they played david  all night which isnt bad thing but how about some variety .
to die for really there isnt one thing on this menu that doesnt live up to mouth watering expectations i have no other words only downside is its cash only there is an atm but they charge you so just fyi .
i want to like this place but then i get mediocre service at the bar and i want to leave .
one of the best paninis i had ever had the  was very good and the prices are nice as well will definately come back .
i went here for brunch on sunday i sat down and ordered a cup of coffee the waiter informed me that they do not serve coffee i thought he was joking but he informed me that he was not i left .
delicious paninis ordered for lunch so huge i ate 12 the next day i had the  imported prosciutto with fontina panini with red onions fresh basil and extra virgin olive oil on whole wheat cant wait to order again .
ah not worth the money or the wait for a flavorless burrito that may or may not have hair in it .
great place we always order from here at my job when we have our staff meetings i prefer their paninis over anyone elses in this neighborhood this place is a must if you love paninis .
gross worth driving to new haven for pizza with decent sauce my whole family was ill an hour after eating here  considering how filthy and dusty and gross the place is probably not .
ordered p18 today for delivery it was delicious a but salty but crunchy flavorful and filling love the pesto just right for lunch also tried half of the  it was ok but i didnt like the whole wheat bread def recommend p18 with regular  bread .
you could starve here while staring at the wait staff as they lean  on the counter looking out the window .
they have delicious paninis nutella crepes the outdoor seating is great and its bring your own wine what more can you ask for you have to try the pastrami swiss pickles mustard on an everything panini its to die for .
super inconsistent depending on the staff available pretty great when its thriving feels like a hidden  tv show when it isnt .
used to be one of my favorite little secrets but it looks like everyone found out never will you be disappointed by the well  sandwiches or salads good food good service an oasis in an otherwise quiet stretch of brooklyn  of quality establishments .
i cant believe they have a vegan menu and also serve foie gras that makes no sense to me foie gras should be illegal to make and serve shame on them .
great paninis soups snd salads this place delivers awesome nutella crepes also and not expensive .
portions on some of the small plates were almost non existent pricey for the quality and quantity of food .
i order from here all the time great food great coffee really nice staff .
my favorite lunch place in philly with amazing cheesesteaks for some reason took cheesesteaks off the menu that decision deserves one star .
best place in bensonhurst love everything nothing has disappointed me yet i plan on eating here on the regular .
honestly the sandwich tasted great my only issue is the lack of meat my god for 10 there was barely any meat just  onions mushrooms and that big ole hot pepper in the fire steak im not the least bit happy .
the food is delicious panini was so savory crepe was scrumptious nutella and strawberry is a must have i just moved here and im going to live in this place tonight im trying a salad .
italian pork sandwich was ok i thought the pork was a bit dry though garlic bomb is a very boring sandwich to me nothing surprising but fills up the stomach .
panino not only has a  and welcoming staff they have the best crepes and the best coffee brewed to perfection i had their turkey crepe it was savory with just the right amount of creamy basil dressing arugula and fontina cheese warm and deliciously cheesey yum .
sandwiches were ok i dont have a very strong stomach so i couldnt really handle the full on pig being butchered right in front of me as i paid at the register we got two sandwiches and only are half of both .
love this place amazing ppl and great food under one roof you can bring your own wine sit outside enjoy an expresso and the cheese platter is amazing my bf and i love going their if you want a great  with great food this is it .
eh go to paesanos .
one of the most  sandwich spots in the area i recommend the p20 cant give five stars because the service certainly isnt anything to boast about .
huh average at best pizza was nothing memorable .
cute cafe i ordered the salmon avocado panini the salmon was very fresh i think adding some cream cheese instead of goat would be better for me though the one  is its a small cafe so when the staff are using the  its really loud .
  shut down this week .
had  grilled chicken smoked mozzarella sun dried tomato panini the sandwich was pretty good and i loved the bread you have to get the creamy basil dressing on the side it is soooo good .
just ok .
another great meal smoked salmon panino with goat cheese avocado and red onions great beef barley soup also .
just another mediocre local sushi joint too focused on strange combo rolls and not enough attention paid to quality fish .
the food was terrific and there were so many choices i had the chicken with goat cheese avocado and balsamic glaze it was delicious we will definitely be back .
dont eat at this place while waiting 15 minutes to get a simple menu saw a mouse running across the floor we  stood up and left there was no soap in the bathroom if the customers are not washing hands nor is the sushi chef .
  consistently delicious paninis the p18 is my fave ordering sometimes takes a bit of time however during the arctic blast we had this week they allowed me to order under the minimum so i did not have to leave my house very kind .
good service but bad food .
good spot in bensonhurst food and coffee are both decent but finally a spot in bensonhurst that we can finally enjoy .
its overpriced and not worth for vegetarians but the service and the ambience is good .
i love this place i always order off grub hub whenever i get a chance and their food never fails to amaze my taste buds they are not pricy because of the quality of the food the food is healthy and taste fresh try their paninis .
this place wants to be trendy and special but it fails miserably service was average food was horrible made me throw up after leaving the place something was clearly wrong with the food after six weeks i am still waiting for the partial refund they promised .
we love this place been there a few times and always enjoyed the food service and atmosphere i would definitely recommend this spot .
the sushi portions were way too small and our  shrimp appetizer was bland and boring the quality of the food is lacking for the prices they charge horrible experience overall do yourself a favor and stay away .
hooray for panino  my coworkers and i often order delivery from here because their paninis are fresh plentiful and delicious they always get our orders right and delivery is quick and efficient .
really beautiful place good service ok prices sushi was average at best good happy hour .
very good place to get great tasting salads creeps and paninis amazing so happy this place is the neighborhood .
horrible atmosphere and mediocre food especially for the price .
i loved their food overall i usually have their panini which is pretty big i think they are closed on sunday which is a bummer .
pure crap over priced and the quality stinks .
polite and good service check good price for portion ratio check outside dining check cash only dinein doesnt bother me delicious food check 4 5 stars definitely will be making multiple trips back here .
 when a restaurant says is closes at 2 then gives its potential customers an attitude for trying to have a drink at 1130 either officially change your hours or suck it up and stay open  .
delicious panini and nice outdoor seating .
unclean  unkind etc just you better dont go there .
first time here and i must say it was delicious i was definitely surprised how unique it tasted especially the way the salmon was cooked in a good way the bread was very crunchy just the way i liked it .
saturday closed stopped by at 2pm the doors were locked and the chairs were on the tables time to update the website .
havent been to their actual location but they are def one of my grubhub faves nom nom .
owner is very rude he refused to serve some of our friends because some of us were wearing   very unprofessional and the hotdogs are just average .
we just moved to bensonhurst and our first day at our new apartment i decided to order lunch from here panini for him salad for me they were both incredibly delicious and delivery quickly by a nice man enough said eat here .
the hot dogs are horrible zero stars i got a burger which was pretty good my daughter got a hot dog took 1 bite and wouldnt eat it i took a bite and threw it in the trash for a hot dog specialty place dont go .
so yummy on a saturday around 1230 place was 80  full the salmon with goat cheese avocado and truffle oil was so delicious and i like the nutella and strawberry crepe affordable and delicious will be back friendly staff .
not a good experience hot dogs were covered with toppings and overwhelmed everything which led me to believe what are they hiding love man vs food but  got this place wrong .
im a fan of their smoked salmon panini .
its a glorified hot dog stand owners response to my comment is below what were you expecting fine linen and silver ware  showing customer service class and how small minded they truly are .
amazing place sometimes i order from here 2x a day .
cute place but the macaroon i got the other day tasted like it had been sitting out for too long sorta  up the taste of shredded gym shoe  .
5 stars hands down for finally finding a place that serves the perfect panini and does not serve sandwiches like other panini  i have tried the mortadella goat cheese and arugula panini would  a dead  im sure the iced  is phenomenal just go .
food was awful eggs were burnt potatoes were not good and the salad was super tiny drinks were okay but i would definitely pass on eating here staff was nice but overwhelmed and busy go for drinks but not for food .
great place for a quick lunch great food great service a must try .
dropped in for just a coffee and wont be back if you like your coffee bitter and burnt this is your spot .
this was my first time here had the grilled chicken panini and was very impressed food was fresh and the bread was delicious .
never been to an italian place where  deny you more bread pizza is burnt staff is slow and unfriendly foods overpriced .
this place is a hidden gem not only are their paninis incredible the smoked salmon panini o m g but the staff are so incredibly friendly and they deliver too .
mango milkshake was nothing to write home about .
p20 absolute heaven the ingredients were incredibly fresh and the pesto was perfection the restaurant is adorable and  totally worth the trip from manhattan i will definitely be back .
the food is decent but the customer service is seriously lacking ive eaten here like 30 times and the owners still act as though they dont know who i am kinda weird the milkshakes are delicious .
i went here for lunch today the sandwich i had was great and the dressing on the salad was even better wish i knew what it was so i could make it for myself the waitstaff were very friendly too bensonhurst could use more eateries like this one .
bland and not so hot for veg options ive given them a few shots and every time im disappointed by a soup whose broth tastes more like the  than any pho ive ever had head for  instead .
this little corner spot is totally awesome the food is yum and the service is excellent .
waiting nearly ten mins before leaving due to the servers lack of interest in making money place is also dated and in need of a deep clean as it smells a bit funky .
amazing food by far the best panni i every had i drive  from staten island to brooklyn just for a panni my favorite is the smoked salmon panni ive loved everything i tried there .
the bartender never checked to see how our food was and left us with empty glasses for a while felt completely ignored he was too busy playing dice with his loud drunk friends .
so glad i found these guys bottom line great paninis awesome  and above all great friendly service i love seeing new small business take pride in their craft and they do so here have been here 3 times already and it has been  good .
not good do not waste your money a lot of money by the way only thing that was half way decent was the desert .
decent takeout general tsos crab rangoon boneless spare ribs beef lo mein etc all appear to be pretty reliable lady answering the phone comes across as very curt so if you can deal with that its worth a try .
i have to say that i was not that impressed the original pizza was loaded with cheese  the grandma was decent but was really  out when the pizza man let out a huge burp .
best chinese food around every time i order chinese food i go to this place great service the lady is sweet speak some english not much the food is really good everytime i get it .
worst place ever food all changed with new owner someone should teach chef how to cook bad saturday tell chef to cook garlic it was white and raw in my shrimp .
my go to place on grubhub i have fallen hard for their pan fried noodles and  wontons .
fast service for delivery food is typical pizza place food not amazing but mediocre and fine if your hungry and not trying to spend a lot one time i found a staple in my soup and almost lost it i guess that could happen anywhere right .
love this place quick and easy chinese takeout they do a brisk business so food doesnt sit and it always seems pretty fresh .
pizza sandwiches are good guy at the front wants to tow my car before i pick up my order dont know what thats about i guess they want you to pickup your order by  but they dont have any bike  .
six of us dined at the restaurant on a monday at  p m service was courteous and prompt the food was very good and plentiful we all enjoyed our meal the restaurant is large and very clean highly recommend .
dog food terrible quality terrible service so many other places for italian .
sushi is always fresh chefs are awesome i like it .
bland food and slow staff pasta sauce was watery even the salad was lack luster .
 is always yummy i love getting a crew together and enjoying their hibachi they are very popular on the weekends but the place is so big there are never long waits its always an awesome group night out with friends .
nothing special with all of the great italian restaurants in the area why would you come here the calamari was chewy the sauce was bland the chicken parm was obviously reheated save your money .
best hibachi in new  the filet melts in tour mouth and the chefs are very friendly .
meh thats all i can say service was slow food was even slower and my family had stomach issues for a few days after enough said .
doesnt compare to  but the food and atmosphere were good 100 for two was a little pricey and the drinks were weak but overall if i had an extra  in my pocket that i dont know what to do with id probably go back .
when you get a good pie its awesome but otherwise just another pizza from jersey i loved this place growing up but something has changed and quality has paid the price .
a pretty typical hibachi place the food is good but a little greasy and fairly expensive but like i said typical hibachi .
yet another pizza joint in  there is a lot of competition and this one falls really really really short go to  or top of the park .
great food huge portions petty cheap spaghetti sauce was kinda blah garlic  were bomb hero was great delivery was 4ever but i tried it on grubhub  up calling and talking to an employee who  made of worth it .
charge for deliveries chicken look  no good food charge to much for what is this place to much bread in general tsos chicken no good at all .
one of my favorite spots i like the decor and the wings are the best the daily  is a mixed offering and although not a large portion its great to share and try a few different things .
i am not commenting on their food cuz the phone girl was super rude and that made me doesnt want to order any food from them .
this place is a great greenpoint secret the dishes are exotic fresh and pretty delicious brunch here is always magical .
a great place to eat poorly made food service zero its a buffet food is greasy and alway leaves me feeling used .
lovely atmosphere and super  service the food is delicious and although you might think the portions are small at first they are truly just right love this place .
waitress was a bitch we were trying to get our money together for the bill and she kept reminding us that the tip isnt included in the fee well that ruined her getting a tip at all .
my favorite local haunt super tasty inspired food cozy clean interior hospitable attentive staff easy on the eyes to boot and be sure to get dessert the panna cotta creme brulee and ice cream are all delicious .
for  only if you want average tasting food go at dinner time when there is high volume and then pick your dishes  needs to train the staff and clean the place better i only go here when my friends want to go .
moved to the area in july and ive been here 4 times already one of the best brunch is good and so is dinner even nice for just a quick drink .
i ordered the churrasco and a  and it was completely flavorless .
delicious restaurant great service try out the bali  salad and the market fish curry they also have expresso and affogato a typical italian ice cream and coffe .
good food but rude customer service inquired about an item and couldnt hear the first time cause i was  to so i asked again and was practically screamed at .
really excellent new flavors for us nice atmosphere great service do try you wont be disappointed .
prepare for extreme slow service specially when dining outside otherwise food at a good price .
had papaya salad fish cakes and market fish curry all delicious not too heavy good selection of bottled beer ciders and wines small but good selection of draft beer service was on point .
8 for  dogfish food was okay atmosphere is okay has tvs i guess good for the island .
wonderful representation of indonesia excellent simply plain white  brings positive energy in the dimly lit dining room and it s  i am happy .
it was ok .
beautiful bright crisp and friendly the atmosphere is enough to keep me coming back but luckily the food is amazing too i highly recommend the black rice porridge for breakfast and the nasi goreng for dinner .
had a good time and was slammed with a tip charge sneaky  even after we left a good tip so check your bill when eating here .
great curries made with fresh highquality ingredients and a perfect espresso bar .
the food is fair but the service is generally bad if you arent a known regular i recommend to go into midtown and go to one if the hundreds of other bars .
great addition to the neighborhood i visited indonesia a couple years ago and crave healthy hearty meals so happy to have this place so near my home thank you   .
i stopped ordering food from this place specially the roast chicken the vegetables were so  they were practically rotten everything else is also disappointing too bad .
absolutely love this place ive been several times for both brunch and dinner and it never disappoints some favorites are the nasi goreng crispy chicken beef rendang and finish with the ice cream the flavors here are just incredible .
nice interior thats actually quite authentic im english slow slow service and filled with suited men  really drinks were horrible bad wine horrible cask beer check came to 25 for 2 drinks never would go back .
fantastic service and food the waiter was very nice and it was all very interesting and new i would definitely go there again .
overrated service decent beer decent food decent seating was uncomfortable cockroach  my date not cool .
mmmmm delicious brunch on saturday my favorite part was how subtle and fresh and simple everything was lovely design as well all very clean and  and refreshing im definitely a fan and i cant wait to go back to try dinner .
used to frequent here something has changed over the last 6 months ordered a grilled chicken greek wrap they forgot the chicken quality of food is low and prices are high the delivery man is scary and  in multiple  whats going on here oh well .
great and fresh and original and sweet and cute and i recommend the appetizers all of them .
i usually write something clever or funny but not this time god awful do yourself a favor and go to wethersfield pizza house this place sucks .
five stars food is delicious place is awesome the van leeuwens are a brooklyn treasure get into it .
violently ill from the food there on one occasion extremely over priced never ever again dont bother .
great new restaurant i will definitely be coming back here soon everything was delicious the bali fish salad was a great way to start followed by the succulent beef rendang and finished with van leeuwens trio of ice cream what a night .
horrible have been in town and given them 2 tries worst tonight i paid 24 95 for a steak she said was  lies i asked foe medium i got well done and cold because th 45 minutes i was told turned into 1 12 hours .
awesome place to stop by for any thing big breakfast plate its great there bagels are out standing egg bacon and lox all day service is really friendly outstanding .
rude service crammed tables mediocre food no substitutions on the menu not even easy ones furniture and tableware in bad condition dirty bathroom yuck not going back .
mom n pop family owned business where you get that home made sandwiches made by mom feeling great alternative to your regular  line sandwich factory coffee is always freshly brewed and bagels baked each morning staff is also very friendly and remembers their regulars .
really below average food i cant understand the hype everything is lacking salt flavor i went for dinner did the mezze platter we did share a really nice salad with a pistachio crusted goat cheese that was perfectly done but everything served after that was a huge disappointment .
ive tried this place a couple times and its always good ive had the breakfast and  island bagels and they are really filling not skimpy on what goes in them also they have always been really friendly .
ehh dont know what the fuss is about bad service and okay fresh food but nothing special definitely not worth the wait at brunch .
stopped in for a burger and fries for lunch today food was tasty staff was very friendly service was quick and price was great cant beat that looking forward to trying their bagels next time im in the area .
i went here once and the food was barely edible yuck never again .
i stopped in for a sausage egg and cheese on an everything bagel i was really craving a good breakfast sandwich and this place delivered fluffy bagels and everything is done made to order and served hot really nice guy and woman behind the counter ill be back .
bland .
very good bagels love the egg bagel sandwich must come back for a lunch sandwich coffee cappuccino machines .
food was ok but nothing special did not like the couscous dishes which were more like a stew with too much liquid the appetizers were better .
great place to hit in the morning coffee and bagels are great and if youre there at lunch time have one of their sandwiches you wont be disappointed love their roast beef great service nice local business much better than any chain .
i dont like this place it is not expensive it is the only positive thing decor is not attractive food is dry and not tasty staff seems new all the time dont recommend it .
best sandwiches in the whole wide world .
im not tolerant of shotty service the last time i was here i got tomato sauce from the crispy dough poured all over me they did nothing to  the situation had to ask for napkins .
i love this place the food is amazing and so are the people that work there they always do everything in their power to make their customers happy .
they have an interesting take on chicken shawarma that i go back for its middle eastern takes on upper class the place is a little too dim especially on a bright sunny day the atmosphere inside is catered towards a cold winter night .
food is really good with great personal service and simple atmosphere go to this restaurant if you want to be around true philadelphians .
there were magots in my latte lots of magots i drank them the manager laughed it sucked its too bad i used to g there a lot i think that is too big of a violation for me to ever go there again check everything .
spinach homemade meatballs provolone omelette this place is awesome friendly welcoming we will be coming back this is great italian family place loved it so much .
awful customer service so rude they made it seem like it was my fault that they gave me a shrimp roll instead of a spring roll im allergic to shrimp .
like cheers for the breakfast crowd of this south philly neighborhood always great food always entertaining easy to get lost in a long breakfast talking to the crowd that  here .
if you want really good sushi go somewhere else but the chinese is pretty good the prices are decent i order take out every now and again just be prepared to wait an hour for your food .
food decent for a lunch place mozz sticks really werent good at all sometimes i go there there out of things but ill say it again place has decent food good place to go for a nice small breakfast lunch great service and workers friendly nice .
greasy pizza and very very slow delivery .
i absolutely love this place the south philly atmosphere is so inviting and the food is great and homemade the meatballs are great try anything on the menu and introduce yourself .
south whitney pizza is not good the pizza and the dough especially taste like it came from the hot lunch line in public school the bathroom was dirty and there was no soap in the dispenser .
lovely we just move to the area and while walking around find this lil corner place its like being home there the  are the nicest the food is great the atmosphere is welcoming and everybody is friendly nothing is fancy its just simple and great .
nasty greasy pizza yuck double yuck .
holy crap awesome spot tiny lunch bar with what might be a small dining area in the back best meatball hoagie ive had in my life hanks sodas too super reasonable prices i cant wait to go for breakfast .
i never really liked the pizza here i found it bland and greasy and overpriced .
make sure to  free dumplings offer but do it in front of the waiter very delicious not the americanized type of chinese food the real deal highly recommend spicy on menu is super spicy so be careful .
this place is nasty and the meat is cooked hard they dont wear hair nets or rubber gloves when handling food the people are rude and nasty .
love this place everytime i go i am never disappointed with the good they stopped being byob which is really disappointing i would say its comparable to han dynasty but closer and with out the wait for a table .
subpar at best if you are looking for good sandwiches in the area i suggest  in  or any  location .
this was first time eating in chinatown and by far this was the best chinese food i have ever had everything was delicious .
enjoyed this place until my  was stolen while waiting during the lunch employees were unhelpful in  me in  down the culprit s will not return .
so far the best place to get hotpot you get so much for what you are paying and they even let you take the left overs home with you .
at present this chinese takeout joint uses only gf soy sauce they have gf rice noodle dishes and fried rice but there can be a language  to it helps to bring a dining card if you want to check on something .
legit family owned chinese restaurant in the heart of philadelphias  food quality is excellent its on the spicy side though there was only two other  people there which was a good sign notably they dont serve a lunch special on the weekend .
terrible terrible i  be missing something here i ask for spaghetti bolognese and get meatballs on top of pasta  and chunks of pork what im disappointed oh and rude wait staff not returning .
4  was my go to restaurant for spicy food but this is my new love lol i love this place .
id rather eat my brothers ass .
authentic szechuan cuisine you can tell by their  and the  of the mouth afterwards this place is a good break from most of the fast service places in the area also they have  if you like to sing .
nothing about this place is impressive the food was mediocre well it sucked thats about all i remember wont go back .
authentic chinese food i go back for their  po tofu all the time service and environment are decent .
the pizza is absolute garbage and the people who actually have the balls to serve it to you should be fucking ashamed of themselves they should take that tip jar they have on the take out counter and  it in there fucking  .
i like e mei restaurant my friend recommended this place and now i strongly recommend it to you to be honest e mei restaurant is the most unforgettable part of my trip to philadelphia .
the pizza is super doughy the sauce is disturbingly sweet about the only edible thing on the menu is the white pie .
this place is great stopped in for lunch after a recommendation from a friend had the chongqing spicy chicken griddle pork ribs and beef with long hots everything was very tasty and appropriately spicy better than han as far as im concerned .
i read the reviews and thought we should try it out meatballs were  the lobster ravioli special was nothing special at all and service was fair plenty of better italian places on s i .
great variety veggie steamed dumplings were awesome lamb entree and scallops great very relaxed atmosphere when there are more non english speaking patrons you know you are in the right palace for chinese food they dont skimp on the spices our new favorite .
huge disappointment drove all the way here i made sure of the hours and it locked up and no answer guess ill never know .
so  recommend fish fillet in hot and spicy  i came here twice and i love it so  .
will never order from here again i use to love this place until i found a roach in my wonton soup a large nasty roach in my soup .
i always enjoy the food here especially shredded pork .
beware see pic above that does not look like hair from the head this was in my boneless spare rib lunch special dont order from this place .
went there with two friends both italian excellent food i especially liked the spicy chicken but the pepper steak was good too also portions are generous for the price .
super cute cafe great atmosphere but the food was so slow to arrive others were complaining asking where their food was food was nice enough but not worth the money or wait .
chinese chicken nuggets braised pork belly everything here is great you really cant go wrong unless you start ordering all the american chinese food like beef n  or sesame chicken but then again that stuff is probably delicious as well .
pretty much your  hipster coffee shop replete with all of the   attitude .
good spicy chinese food bring the heat .
food is good 75 of the time my drink is forgotten and another driver has to be sent out .
i am so in loved with this restaurant this is def one of my favorites come here all the time .
the store advertises that they open at noon on sundays i was there at 1215 and not a soul was in the store the lights were off and the door was locked .
really good food cant wait to go back again and order so more yummy dishes .
ordered wings and asked for half  half teriyaki they give us a bag with the bottom filled with a  soup and the wings themselves were soggy and the mixed up flavor  .
the hot pot is really good the water boiled beef is good and everything else i tried has been good .
wings were bland and wait was wayyy too long for take out counter guy was rude too wont go back .
yummmmyyy the dishes are spicy and delicious prob one of my favorite restaurants now love the variety if dishes they offer if you love spicy like i do definitely worth it try .
it wasnt downright bad but at some point someone is going to have to explain to me why anyone would wait in line for this simply mediocre pizza total disappointment service was excellent though .
yum yum yum my friend and her  and  came here for a late lunch this past sunday and the  cuisine satisfied both our  and our palates yay for leftovers .
a new haven institution but why ive had better pizza at pizza hut surly service never again .
 always has a ton of food ive been there a few times now and love how spicy the dishes are service is sometimes slow depending on how busy it is but they have some great dumplings also pretty sure its byob which is sweet .
nasty toppings including frozen spinach i just dont get the fuss  in west hartford is a million times better .
lamb with cumin yummy .
i feel that everyone in ct knows about pepes pizzas well it is overrated pizzas are ok not good not bad nothing unique because of the excessive reputation of the restaurant there is always a 2030 min waiting line it is not worth it .
been here a few times now and its got some authentic szechuan dishes the  pork is especially tasty as they use garlic leafs and cured pork to make it the right way to make it in my opinion also try the lamb dry hotpot amazing .
they live solely off their reputation pricy brick oven pizzas come out burnt on the  burnt and inedible the clam pies are very salty and smaller compared to other pies that are supposed to be the same size staff need serious attitude adjustment .
great authentic chinese food stick to the traditional menu with the authentic chinese dishes and you will be fine if you enjoyed han dynasty this is more of the authentic version of it the  style dishes are simply awesome and would highly recommend this place .
the pie was fine but the service was abysmal and  hostile with so many pizza options in new haven youd think at least one restaurant would want to  itself from the rest through its helpful or friendly staff .
tasty and huge portions really oily though but i guess thats ok if its your thing .
too long a queue for  slower than fette sau actually brisket was good sausages are decent ribs not so much on a lazy slow saturday its worth checking out otherwise pass .
best resturant at chinatown my favorites  hot noodle sliced beef in chill sauce pickled peppers chicken hot and sour potato  jean belly and  beef .
tried brisket and beef rib huge rib good but the brisket was way better try that not a fan of the beans and potato salad mac and cheese was pretty good though .
fantastic food awesome service very glad i checked yelp .
was excited to try especially since a texan  recommended it to us pulled pork sandwich was dry brisket and potato salad was delish beans arent my thing but definitely unique .
food was good service was good a bunch of asian ppl there the second u walk in only a few of the servers speak english but other then dat everything was great .
waited in line the guy comes back 5 min after telling they re closed for the next 10 minutes make up your mind when you wanna take a  break dont waste people s time your service sucks ass .
fun place to go and get a hot pot with friends .
came here after reading reviews arrived at 9pm on sunday and three main smoked meats were already sold out very disappointed way too much vinegar in the collard greens the meats for tender but way overpriced .
the best chinese restaurant in chinatown the food is really good and fast and tasty and reasonable pricing what else is to ask for .
went there for breakfast this morning had pancetta hash way too salty small and really not worth the price people who worked there not the friendliest bunch can you say attitude with all the other places on passyunk ill be going elsewhere .
solid chinese food .
we left before eating after a mouse ran across the floor .
oh the smell of chili oil as you walk in that delcious savory msg flavor this place is delicious compared to philly stuff i am a los angeles food snob and therefore 5 stars so good tad expensive but not too bad overall .
i heard that the original owners moved which makes complete sense because now the food for the most part is over priced they changed the bread portions are small and the sandwiches are not consistent the old owners were great new ones not so much .
spicy and delicious if youre in a  like i was give this place a shot order their chongqing sp chicken youll be happy .
really good place to eat but is always crowded i made a reservation but when i arrived i had to wait for 40 minutes .
food is spicy and cheap decently authentic i like it and will come back again .
third time not a charm very good in the past two months not tonight four different dinners equally disappointing tasteless food needs seasoning and flavor there was none to be found we went there with expectations we left with disappointment ps the service  the food .
its a great place for spicy food nice and clean but very pricy .
didnt stay for the food unfortunately so loud and noisy couldnt hear ourselves talk .
service was excellent food is amazing certainly a favorite from chinatown clean and tasty .
nothing really to write home about .
the service and food are both exceptional thanks for making my friends 21st birthday so memorable special shoutout to ah  who provided excellent food suggestions helped with the cake and candles and was generally just an awesome human being .
rude rude rude staff i will never step foot into  even if you paid me .
i like their lunch special a lot just go you will know what i am talking about by the way the boss is super friendly .
food took forever no time to eat it had to rush to atm to pay cash only maybe if we had brought wine we could have stood it hope the kitchen staff enjoyed our leftovers which were plentiful .
this is my current fave chinese restaurant in chinatown everything is always tasty and service is usually good love the kung pao chicken fish filet in spicy sauce squash cold chicken appetizer beef and tripe .
wings are drier than sand and very pricey place is dirty in appearance and the staff is very unfriendly .
this place is amazing hummus is so so good portions are kind of small but the taste and good service makes up for it will go back so good .
swings was always ok  is better by far i say that the best late night place to grub on some wings is the new wings over new haven dont get me wrong swings is good but i would rather go elsewhere .
love this place reasonably priced delicious and somehow unique mediterranean  you can go causal with dips and sides crazy baba is crazy good or go all out with robust entrees nice house wine and great service every time .
worst drivers ever dude wont even get out of the car and opened and ate one of my wings so grossed out never again .
amazing amazing amazing delicious delicious delicious the best middle was term vegetarian friendly good in nyc the food is to die for and have a ton of vegetarian options the staff is friendly and quick i highly recommend for a first date anniversary or special occasion .
certainly not the best wings ever especially completely sober but they do hit the spot when there arent many other options the regular fries are delicious okay ordered for the last time a few months back and they smelled very badly i almost vomited never again .
fantastic food everything we ate was amazing  atmosphere friendly staff  was excellent .
awful pizza i just dont understand why anybody in montclair would go here for pizza there are so many better options .
stumbled upon this gem of a restaurant while exploring williamsburg amazing all around from the presentation to the service atmosphere and to the taste of course you have to go do not miss out on this experience .
pizza very doughy food is just ok .
zizi  restaurant shes dead but this place  her name and just like her character on green acres this place is mediterranean and sexy as fuck go here just saying .
the pizza was ok the service was terrible .
i love this place a great set of foods that you can share or just order your own dish friendly staff nicely prepared food and comfy environment i strongly recommend and yes you can bring mom and dad there .
pizza is great went there for dinner and had the chicken  and it was gross sad cause the last two time i been there the food was great but this wa drowning in brown sauce so gross .
talented chef menu that  everyone vegetariansvegans and  and its really reasonably priced i cant say enough good things about this place ive been here a few times and have had consistently wonderful dinners .
nothing outstanding or  about the food here the pizza is ehhhh the chicken parm was bland the highlight was the friendly staff .
really great service the food was delicious and the atmosphere super laid back the kids enjoy it too .
 across the street is much better there are onion chunks under the cheese yuck bad sauce too .
nicest staff and delicious food .
a few months ago friend and i had a couple pieces of the pepperoni pie and antipasto salad unfortunately soon after leaving experienced bad case of diarrhea friend tried the place again recently and got sick after no thanks .
absolutely delicious wild salmon and short ribs were complex and perfectly cooked earthy perfectly cooked liver with crispy flavorful asparagus .
chefs specialty roast duck noodles edible but these folks need to be in a different line of work for sure .
some of the best middle eastern food food ive ever had theres a weird desert that looks like shredded chicken worth it if you saved room .
the usual chinese fare at the usual prices and with the usual amount of sauce salt and flavor .
this is an amazing spot in williamsburg highly recommend .
its been a while but i went here once on a whim and just found it to be soso 2 5 star if anything i just remember it being dark and the food was bland .
great dishes plenty of different flavors explode into your mouth nice atmosphere and decoration service is good too music is a bit loud at night we have been to this restaurant twice and will definitely come back more often .
worst service ever took forever to prepare the order for to go food is worst dont go .
good food good service .
ordered take out from this place chicken was dark meat and tasted horrible my wife got the dosa which she said was ok .
i love this little place the food is delicious and authentic great service and vibe .
very average food not a great buffet spread the curries tasted bland desserts were just ok small place so service was not an issue .
the food was delicious i liked the shawarma better than the  the service was friendly but the food took too long to come out .
reuben was solid but nothing amazing and didnt fill me up definitely not worth 11 or a special trip also the homemade lemonade was crap from instant mix .
prob one of my most favorite restaurants i usually dine here few times a week great atmosphere and friendly staff the  is a great guy and has a funny  i love the  cuisine highly recommending this place .
im upset with this place today waited in line for 15 minutes only to be told that theyre out of corn beef who does that  brisket house apparently not happy with them today .
 eastern food taken to the next level sophisticated with a lot of soul ambience is relaxed service is friendly all in all great for brunch dinner date or just hanging out for a beer .
ordered the brisket and was served a plate of fat sure i know brisket isnt the  cut but their brisket is repulsive expensive and awful .
great  that its not overly crowded or loud food is very good but im bummed they took the mackerel nicoise off the menu .
tried the brisket wasnt crazy about it its as if i had gone into some hipsters ironic restaurant of averageness and ordered a sandwich ill give them one more try but i wasnt impressed .
wow the food was excellent best  i ever had in ny .
probably only good if you get the real italian food dont even cook entirely in olive oil my sisters salmon was grey .
really good food and good atmosphere will def go there again .
good food nice atmosphere but felt very rushed came in at 630 and felt rushed out by 730 by 8pm it was clear we had  our welcome this overshadowed the meal .
buenisimo just order random stuff you will like everything .
its pretty hit or miss if youll get a good  or a good drink have gotten margaritas there before that were just sour mix .
came here with some friends for a meal on a friday night and it was delicious great friendly wait staff very small and quaint restaurant very filling and tasty food just need a few more cocktails on the menu .
if you want to grab a drink this is the place to go good atmosphere and delicious margaritas but if you want to eat good quality mexican food i dont recommend margaritas food is very very blend .
finally a straight forward mediterranean kitchen which is unpretentious and doesnt try to be something that is not stuffed cigars ox tail  artichoke yogurt semolina cake were all amazing highly recommended .
very mediocre food and the service is hit or miss margaritas are very good and are probably what keeps them in business for what they are doing they should be doing it better .
holy awesomeness  was such a helpful and welcoming manager i felt like i was a friend from the moment i got there the food is oh so delicious my favorite was the cigars yummmmmm and no meat i will be back again and again .
paid a cover sat down ordered a drink and then we were asked to move from the table smelled in there .
comfortable environment great service delicious fresh reasonably priced food ive never met a falafel i liked until i came here ive been here twice and ordered delivery once every experience has been great .
this place is pretty lame except for the drink specials why do all of the bars in montclair end up being exactly the same mediocre all the way around .
great food affordable great service and nice atmosphere what more could you want the passion fruit cocktail was amazing as was the gravlax appetizer the beet salad the  the  peppers the tahini the everything we got .
pros good beer selection good burger great steak fingers  bar outdoor seating cons potato pancakes are actually tater tots slow poor service hard roll for burger seated at the stage with no other tables around felt like i was on display .
been to zizi limona many times get that falafel  baba gravlax 3 small  is where its at atmosphere is chill bathroom is crazy nice .
we had a big party so we were seated in the back but apparently the drink specials cant be served in the back wth the food was nothing special the service was horrible it took the waitress forever to bring us  and just one glass of water .
this place is amazing .
terrible service stressful atmosphere servers constantly  meat in your face one even dropped a piece of greasy meat on my  food was solid but did not make up for the hectic atmosphere and poor service never again .
so far ive had a kabob sandwich moroccan sub and the chicken shwarma sandwich all have been extremely tasty lots of unique smokey flavors delicious and more creative than your average middle eastern cuisine also try the house made hot sauce .
the burgers were so dry i could through them on a wall and the pizza was nothing to brag about prob give them a try in the far future .
came here for brunch after everything else was too  or closed on new years day super friendly staff and delicious pita bread .
there are very slow had a 20 min before show stop by and order  12 minutes waited for my order was very upset .
i ordered from zizi limona for dinner home fries falafel shawarma delicious so glad to find good food for delivery in williamsburg everything is always just okay or just plain bad zizi is a very welcome addition to the local scene yum .
foods good portion sizes are way too small for the price especially for brunch plus no free refills on coffee is kind of annoying .
head chef   who hails from top restaurants in   and  has  the  of any single culture by  the flavors of israel italy  and greece a must try .
sadly my chicken was  overcooked scant sauce and under seasoned eggs were baked to death wine pours were minimal boring overall .
fantastic mediterranean fare highly recommend the sometimes a cigar is just a cigar for an appetizer which is crispy dough filled with mozzarella honey almonds and basil absolutely mouth watering .
the food is not bad however this is ny and so im not short of choice when it comes to great restaurants i guess next time i feel like dealing with 45 condescending b that congregate around the hostess  ill come back here read never .
i live around the corner they just opened the food was amazing great service but we did wait over 10min for the main i guess its because they just opened still the food was crazy good 5 stars yes .
for dinner this place is spot on great crowd good food avoid like the plague  brunch unless of course you want to deal with a bunch of inconsiderate parents that bring their loud screaming kids to brunch .
zizi rocks .
average food and ambiance .
the best peruvian food in town .
kind of insanely overpriced but if youre too lazy to find any of the other million italian places in new york than barbuto is a total  btw you can get the same dishes only better at bianca for under half the price nice interior exterior though .
excellent food drink and service our bartender was super nice the pizza guys were so attentive the only reason why i didnt give it 5 stars no availability to make reservations .
i got delivery from here it took a long time the sausages were good the sides i didnt like amd for the amount of money we paid it was incredibly expensive .
i love this place it is my go to place for great pizza and wine the staff is fabulous and always makes us feel special try the  pizza it will not disappoint its salty creamy and very earthy with the fresh rosemary they also have great specials .
local dive bar with bad dive bar food and cheep beer watch what you order or risk getting the gi  .
so fresh and tasty from the fresh ricotta cheese to the hand made pasta it all melts in your mouth we really enjoyed the chefs choice meat and cheese appetizer a wide range of flavor .
used to be great but lately the food isnt what it used to be the staff is polite but there was one new girl who actually seem as she was forced to work there so unhappy and rude hey management whats going on .
no ones pizza is as good as zavino i feed my addiction monthly and last night had the pear salad and polpettini pizza i love the cozy atmosphere the wonderful aroma and the friendly service .
chicken not good hot sauce  so so service is wack jalea not good the taste is like american food and ceviche was good but they  a lot so i might try again the following month and see if they got better .
good crowd i had a margherita pizza here and it was one of the tastiest pizza in philly .
update service has taken a  as of late not just once but the last couple of visits sorry but there is plenty of chicken places around here  el pollo  peru .
very warm ambience a little noisy i wasnt to fond of the television in the bar area pizza is really good nice location .
overpriced and tasteless food the first bad meal was the ton katsu the meat tasted like it was in the freezer for a year the second bad meal was the steak teriyaki seriously how do you screw up steak .
by far my favorite place to get pizza in philly cozy atmosphere speedy service and delicious pizza go for happy hour go with a date go with yourself just go .
as a tried to become a regular for my breakfast meals i slowly got more and more  with the service here customer service  got worst  need a how to treat customer 101 course badly .
another good recommendation from a ny coworker who had her rehearsal dinner here seating is a bit cramped but a fun bustling place a good variety of salads pizza and pasta my arugula and pistachio pesto pizza was delish as was my hubbys prosciutto and béchamel pizza .
been here a few times and its nothing like the old  its very expensive and the food seems to be all cisco heat and serve not very tasty at all the service was not too friendly either .
their cheese and meat plate is the best top quality selections it comes with some kind of sweet jam that is really tasty their pizza is great too .
just a disguised diner had some eggs over easy this morning eggs were cooked right but the home fries were a pile of tasteless bland potatoes come on guys this in nj land of home fries kudos for having strawberry jam for my toast though .
rosemary flat bread excellent diavolo great cheese pizza for kids very good draft beer hop devil very good seating outside brutal  sidewalk wobbly tables are tough w kids recommend absolutely but sit inside w kids .
it turned out outside drinks are not allowed we were not allowed in because we had smoothie in hands they said they could save the drink in the fridge but the smoothie will  after the meal that was not nice .
theres a warm place is my heart for this place pizza cocktails   board and charming setting make this place a real delight small draught list but a nice alcoholic selection overall go for a swanky second date or a great happy hour .
food is bland and too much msg overhyped and too modernized it doesnt taste authentic enough for it to even pass as a mediocre vietnamese restaurant .
best pizza in the city this place is great for a date or very small group the wine list is impressive and there is something for everyone  is a place i will always go to when i want pizza always fresh ingredients .
big  restaurant with boring food waiters are cloyingly obnoxious vegetarians beware they will try to feed you fish even after you explain your dietary needs vegans  only add eggs to the  list split the scene and go around the corner to vientiane instead .
great pizza i love it they have gluten free pizza and yummy olives too highly recommend the place is a but cramped and they dont take reservations so just be prepared to wait a bit on the weekends always have great service .
sadly the service and food has steadily gone down hill good drinking bar but the restaurant side needs attention menu is tired .
as far as im concerned this is the only place you can get good pizza in this city you can find ray behind the bar he makes the place feel like cheers only more refined .
ordered a french dip and chicken cheesesteak got an ice cold roast beef sandwich with no au jus and a chicken cutlet with cheese will not go back stay away .
every time i go to zavino i have a great fabulous meal and a great time love the pizza ive also had spaghetti squash and it was wonderful its fun to sit outside and people watch while enjoying your meal .
never ever ever again they had us wait for over an hour for our food while everyone else around us had ate and left the food was absolutely awful and they gave me a dirty cup to drink out of hello health department .
great front end service great salads but i think they forgot to cook our pizza as it took a long time to get id visit again though .
i was looking forward to trying  but i walked away very disappointed none of the dishes the appetizer sampler the coconut crusted tilapia and the arroz con pollo was very good i wont be back and i wouldnt recommend it to others .
great service and awesome food i personally prefer zavino over tria their price is comparable to their food quality and  im saying theirs is bigger remember bigger doesnt mean better love their spaghetti squash dish whatever that was its bangin i am coming back fo  .
great service and atmosphere but food was too greasy tho good presentation as someone else mentioned i prefer soul de cuba you might enjoy it if you dont mind  food but i personally cant stand it .
the place was wonderful attentive waitresses and good service the wine was good food was excellent and they had outdoor seating my only complaint was that it was a bit cramped seating was tight .
not great old cold dry rice with the pork entree and an average salad its very overpriced for what you get but even if it were dirt cheap i wouldnt go back .
third favorite pizza in philly love the hh specials cant go wrong with the marguerita pizza and draft beer selection is good with reasonable prices for a restaurant make sure you check the specials board inside .
food was okay its fast food essentially the food was kind of tasteless and they charged us for getting hot sauce .
i love this place its comfy and cozy great for when its cold or raining we sit near the oven and watch all the pizzas cook never a bad choice their house made pastas are amazing .
 service staff was not welcoming nor friendly it took ten minutes for a server to even acknowledge us only giving it two stars because my coworkers   breakfast and my cobb salad were delicious .
zavino definitely has one of the best cheese and meat boards in the city and the service is always great ive had sasha as a server many times and she never disappoints keep it up guys .
beautiful location zero wait and perfect spot to wander in after hanging out by the water however food was disappointing after all the hype surrounding the location on mott st .
we had a terrific experience outdoor dining on a friday afternoon cheese and meat plate with wine and people watching .
thanks for the dish water we actually ask for a coffee .
it is really all its cracked out to be i had the veal topped pizza and a bourbon smash and will be definitely going back for more before my work trip is over .
my wife i were seated for breakfast and were not waited on for 15 minutes i counted even the diners next to us were wondering where the waitstaff went we quickly left and went elsewhere .
easily the best pizza ive ever had and thats saying a lot the cured meats olives etc etc are all great also but the pizza is just ridiculously good .
croque monsieur it is simply not ok to make one using rye bread i mean would you bake a cake with rye bread what about rye bread donuts rye cookies rye flour anyone on the bright side probably one of the best bloody marys around .
this places pizza helped understand what life truly meant it tasted very fresh and beautiful also very great and  i ordered the joey and eggplant parm no regrets reasonably priced super service and overall great restaurant for an intimate date or small group outing .
ill only come here if im feeling snobby the food is ok but the atmosphere is uck what is happening to brooklyn .
had two different pizzas beat salad was excellent and the rabbit ravioli was amazing they make all pastas in house which i love .
they are not  friendly i wont go back i guess they dont want my familys business telling us to go elsewhere nearby when they were empty for late lunch .
ricotta of the day was awesome and the 2 pizzas we tried stache mortadella were delicious .
very disappointing incredibly rude staff and mediocre food my husband and i have been a few times and we always expect a better experience but we always leave disappointed i wont be back .
do not ever pass up the vegetable plate or the eggplant parm pizzas are tasty sangria in a warm day is a hit .
so slow to deliver the food we wait for  for the entrees dont come if you wanna get a dinner in a hour .
brussels sprouts appetizer and joey pizza were the bomb highly recommend probably should have sat inside because sitting outside felt a little like sitting in the street other than that great place .
2 stars is probably generous we ate there on  ordered the special pasta  the food was average at best service was incredibly slow .
delicious food very good service the vegetables here are absolutely fantastic great for vegetarians however can be hard to get a table love love love the food .
i want to like it and i do but ill never go back beer selection is excellent the food is good a little pricey but nice quality very quaint little bar one star is for service and thats all i am going to say about that .
did i mention that i am obsessed with zavino .
called at 1045 on a friday to see how busy they were and if the kitchen is open until 12 it went to  twice .
came in late on a saturday and found 3 seats at the bar service was impeccable and the joey pizza is one of the finer things in life cant wait to be back it was crowded but the  was bustling and fun .
interesting to try these oldschool cocktails but the stink from the oil lamps on all the tables made me eager to leave .
had a great pizza perfect size for two good wine good service and fair price we would def go back .
theres two floors the first one of which is a typical neighborhood bar and the second one of which is a  setting with ceilings too low stools that want to  over and waitresses that have better things to do than serve your drinks .
cute spot great location excellent staff decent prices food was mediocre id try again .
you cant make a reservation and trying to go with a group is a nightmare .
one of the best things i have ever tasted is their shrimp scampi appetizer the only thing wrong with it is that it isnt an entree this place has very unique offerings and is a great evening out very busy so call ahead first .
it took 23 mins for my halohalo order crazy lack of  on their part  pie is my fave part .
highly recommend the baby jesus and the veal meatballs both were cooked well and tasted delicious the pizzas are nice as well i prefer going to this place in the summer with the outdoor seating option .
i feel cheated i wanted to try the  burger today i open the box and guess what no pineapple or bacon it .
solid choice in terms of service friendly vibe at the bar and of course the food in other words i enjoyed it reasonably priced too .
i dont understand how they can be open for business when more than half of the items on their menu is unavailable my sister boyfriend and i went to  on a wednesday morning with a built up appetite and nothing we wanted was available thats ridiculous .
ridiculously good food in town from l a and cant wait to come back eggplant parm is amazing .
so disappointed came here at  on a tuesday to buy some lumpia and they were sold out id figure they would have lumpia in stock before the dinner crowd gets here maybe they didnt get  because of the  but its still unacceptable .
i had two great dishes during my visit baby jesus meat and cheese and the stache pizza i would love to come back and try their other menu items it is a little cramped in there so if your neighboring table tells a joke be prepared to laugh .
just pure nostalgia for  nothing spectacular about the food service and location hard to park during peak time one  thing i can say is if you grew up in jersey city there is a high  you will see a fellow  friend or  .
love this place philadelphias pizza scene is  and zavino is right out front very inventive super crisp pies interesting wines by the glass and a great cheese board to start .
just sat here for exactly 25 minutes without being acknowledged i wish i couldve tasted the food it wasnt too busy .
loved the place cute atmosphere and food was great .
food was fresh but it really wasnt anything special the staff was rude and not friendly in the least bit its a good last minute spot but not the place for a really good meal .
delicious pizza but a little over priced for what you get however i would definitely recommend this place to anyone looking for great pizza ill be back .
make sure u wont sit in downstairs it smells horrible the foods are just all right .
if i could give more than 5 stars i would the diavolo pizza is the best ive ever had in my life which is saying a lot coming from someone who eats pizza multiple times a week they also have great happy hour specials .
ill keep this short and sweet im on the trail of the best pho in ct york street noodle houses pho broth is bland their kimchi dumplings are too next .
best gourmet pizza ive ever had ever we had the stache pizza the beet salad avocado salad were both incredible as well we skipped wine went with beer so no comment there service was great even on a busy night will definitely keep going back .
love the concept but too much lettuce and barely any toppings you will understand after you eat there once its all salad a little less salad and more toppings would be nice .
amazing pizza wine atmosphere of a sidewalk cafe lovely evening awesome wait system they text you when your table is ready so you can explore some of the great shops nearby .
pizza tastes like cardboard the cheese was extremely oily and the sauce was nonexistent the staff was rude never coming back .
actually a decent thin crust pizza in center city the pizzas are crispy and flaky and the toppings fresh and interesting watch out as you  it down you may burn the roof of your mouth .
unfortunately i could only rate one star and not zero pizza was below average we had chicken marsala and it tasted like it came out of a can avoid this place and save your money .
had the chorizo pizza almost too much cilantro but very good nonetheless good service and atmosphere as well if they had ac it would be 5 stars haha .
had a quick lunch here slice pizza seemed comparable to any other places the meatball parm was a disappointment they must buy frozen meatballs at restaurant depot and serve it on a roll because it was pretty gross how hard is it to make a fresh meatball .
bam this place is absolutely amazing tasting board chock full of crazy good meats and cheeses with accompaniments eggplant parm stack veal meatballs packed with flavor and gnocchi so good we ordered it twice for wine sangria and  apps this place is the bees knees .
not a fan ive been to this place a dozen times hoping the service would get better but its a hit or miss .
my favorite place in philly ever .
very disappointing i ordered the cheesesteak with on a plain roll the meat and cheese had something foreign in it like grit i could only eat 1 bite .
sweetest staff cute spot good location very fair prices no complaints .
been meaning to try this place for a  recommended by a friend had the tuna sandwich good but got terribly sick after word also sage tea was nice .
great spot small and with a lot of character food was awesome and great drink menu staff was also really nice and helpful great lunch spot .
i ordered the spinach pies not very good soggy no real taste also got the artichoke chicken salad portion size was huge but chicken was dry .
as good as pizza gets in  the quality rivals that of the top nyc pizzerias .
 service soggy lukewarm spinach pie and  cucumber salad go to local instead .
highly recommend this place amazing pizza and very friendly fast service .
hmmm soso i cant much about it other than nothing really note worthy .
polpettini pizza the best pizza ive ever had the crust is amazing chewy and flavorful im pairing it with a  hope to be able to visit again soon .
hummus place is way better snack is a rip off i got a platter of three appetizers it cost 13 so i was expecting a decent amount of hummus but snack gave me three little containers and not even enough pita to eat it with .
everything about our meal tonight was amazing the outoftown cousins who are serious foodies gave it their approval and still our kids who wont eat anything weird loved their pizzas too we shared five pizzas six different small plates and two salads and very little was left over .
despite being an outdoor space they are not dogfriendly given that they are right next to the dog park this is a real bummer the restaurant that formerly occupied this exact same space was very dogfriendly .
love this place my husband and i come here often for pizza and a few drinks they also have delicious assorted meats and cheeses definitely a hidden gem in philadelphia and its way better and less expensive than stella .
my fish sandwich consisted of   of what seemed to be leftover fish bun was hard as a rock disgusting and the cashier had zero personality .
located in the heart of 13th streets restaurant row unfortunately it is often overlooked because of barbuzzo lolita and jamonera excellent place for wine and pizza highlights joey pizza baby jesus olives veal and ricotta meatballs no reservations though .
i tried their fish and chips i didnt like it the fish was not fresh and it was very oily .
the food is delicious i eat here every time im in town i love the margherita pie grilled shrimp scampi and the riesling the kennett is ok .
pizza wasnt great very bland ordered online and wrong order was delivered the order was fixed but with no money taken off nothing done .
they serve a thin crust pie and it would have been better if the center was just a bit more crisped but it was very tasty not bad pizza .
looks good on the surface with lots of different styles and options for pizza but both times ordering via eat24 led to a lousy experience subpar food order mistakes order from  instead .
not bad .
philly breakfast sandwich was disgusting  was way too big with no vegetables lettuce tomato etc and scrapple itself was gross should have gone to china town .
wonderful combinations and pizza the crust was outstanding .
i went there for sunday brunch and was unimpressed people who were seated well after me were served before me i had to ask more than once before they finally brought me some water and the eggs benedict were simultaneously overcooked and cold .
tasty pizza appealing atmosphere friendly wait staff .
the veggie burger patty looked like it was deep fried and was slathered with mayo youre doing it wrong kite key only reason im not giving a 1 star rating is because our server was pretty cool .
great atmosphere and staff the best pizza around and a great wine section to match had the mushroom soup with truffle oil and their veal meatball pizza wow always friendly and inviting with attentive management .
tasteless food service was ok person who brought our food seemed annoyed when we asked for ketchup fries seemed like they were microwaved breakfast burrito had no flavor even with the side sauce potatoes were too salty .
meat and cheese plates are delicious and plentiful pan roasted squid was cooked well and pizzas are creative and flavorful ambience and service perfect for a low key chill night in the city .
went here later at night for drinks and a snack there was a cockroach crawling on the wall next to our table the waitress did nothing about it and made an excuse it was  dont come late at night unless you want cockroach as an appetizer .
i loved this place not only were their bottles of wine reasonably priced but they were good great pizzas cute interior and the vibe overall was low key i wish there was a place like this in my neighborhood this was quite the little downtown gem .
cold food .
the best pizza ive had in philadelphia the pizza is unique and extremely fresh and the place has a cool vibe .
what kind of restaurant  corn chips to make them blue corn chips if youre hurting for a meal that will turn your poop a  blue look no further than kite  nachos .
best pizza ever cooks in an  degree oven for two minutes great atmosphere neighborhood outdoor seating .
food ok service slow restrooms disgusting 2 had no toilet paper 3rd had no lighting to find it thank goodness for my phones flashlight .
this is a wine bar that also has awesome food very rare combination but their pizzas are die for they also have a gluten free option that my  friends tell me is pretty good .
chicken as an app was good reuben needs improvement and  comes with coleslaw and no fries hamburger ordered cooked raw .
amazing pizza loved the atmosphere they take great pride in their dishes and the wait staff always had good recommendations combined with a strong knowledge of what they offered would definitely revisit .
dont make the mistake we made by coming here the food was terrible the burger was dry and had no flavor not to mention the service was bad the owner really needs to make some changes to his staff .
great place probably one of the best pizza places ive been to great  if meats to top your pizza and a great selection of beer to compliment that tasty pizza ill be sure to go back soon .
for a place called elbow room there sure is a lot of room for improvement they clearly havent read all these horrible reviews .
zavino is an excellent place for pizza with a great ambiance i ordered the mushroom and margarita pizzas and loved them both their wine list is well rounded too the 13th street area is quickly becoming a destination neighborhood for good food .
felt i was on restaurant rescue looked around for cameras but didnt see any worst food i ever had in west hartford real slap in the face  and seeing billy  across the street .
great place .
poor quality food generally  service no real ambiance to speak of im not sure how this place manages to remain open with so much competition within walking distance .
the food here is really good the sheeps milk ricotta was very flavorful and the bread was delicious every we tried was tasty and fresh it is definitely a nice little wine bar ill be back .
the kobe burger was dry and mostly  despite the fact that i asked for it medium the wine wasnt properly  and the waiter was rude and unapologetic never again .
just like all the other reviews i was impressed by zavino pizza was excellent environment was very good nothing negative to say not even particularly expensive but wow the pizza so tasty you really cant go wrong on the 13th street  block .
nice outside deck to hang out on  tables and floor are a turn off but a nice space .
lets keep this short and sweet delicious delicious delicious pizza still love  rustica but this is right up there too which to choose thats a great problem to have .
ive only eaten at the bar which is very small and the food was ok with so many choices so close by i would opt for somewhere else .
zavino is a great place for happy hour good pizza options good deals on wine and beer plus outdoor seating works for me they last time i was here there was a  band playing in the doorway kind of bizarre but equally awesome .
i used to have a great time at this place or great by west hartford standards anyway however the last time i went there something got dropped into the drinks of my friend and i and we spent the entire night  gross .
we love this place and cant say enough good things about the food staff and service .
i forgot to share the threatening message the owner sent to me about a year ago the friends who are writing the positive reviews should be ashamed he said i dont understand you getting so personal going after me i dont even know you now i do .
this place is consistently great the menu is not very large but the quality of the food is outstanding .
one word gastroenteritis my dad and i went over the holidays and both of us have had upset stomachs since then now i have to take antibiotics great .
this was the best pizza i have had in the longest time such an amazing variety of food with combinations that not only  the taste buds but ingredients that  each other bravo .
i hate to write a bad review of this place but ive been here about three times and although the  are unbelievably sweet the coffee and ambiance just arent up to par .
twice this week ive taken outoftowners there both crowds raved food is always great and the bartenders are fantastic .
quite honestly the worst cup of coffee i have ever had i cant even explain how terrible it tasted and i watched them brew it so i know it was fresh it tasted like vinegar its a shame because the place is clean and attractive .
delicious food great time definitely a great spot .
had a bad experience with this place took my sis along with me to this joint since we eat only chicken asked if they have chicken param they  the cheese pizza they had into chicken param soo the crust was like biscuits i couldnt eat them .
their meat and cheese tasting board is amazing great wine delicious beers and the staff is always super nice did i mention the pizza margarita delicious best pizza in philly we go every friday for happy hour .
ordered their special vegetarian pizza and buffalo wings pizza was very bland and ha brocoli on it wings are very bad will never go back to this place .
really good place for a quick pizza or a longer dinner not too loud for being such a small place the meat they put on their pizzas is really really good nice friendly service .
ordered a veggie pie and it was ok it tastes overcooked probably wouldnt go back .
good small plates and cool atmosphere hang out at the bar .
