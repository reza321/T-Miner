really didnt see any vegan items on the menu soy milk wasnt even listed as an option on the board i got a decent soy cappuccino but i have had better i dont need to go here again .
the coffee is just better hear than all of the options in the area i now actually walk out of my way to just get my iced lattes here the food is pretty darn tasty too .
noise good food ok coffee moderate price but much too noisy from a terrible heatingac system to enjoy a peaceful meal .
great location love the vibe food and love the service highly recommended .
great idea great menu awful food my sandwich had undercooked eggs and a hair on it .
the toast of town .
paid 7 for a bagel with lox to go i got one tiny sliver of lox and it took 15 minutes what a complete joke .
i think this is one of the cutest coffee shops ever visiting for just a night and staying across the street and been here twice already i am from ny so to some of the other comments nothing is expensive compared would definitely stop by .
u have to be drunk to eat the food here they should be ashamed to serve this i came her with my pregnant wife and she stopped eating in fear of the safety of our un born child they give u paper plates to eat off of .
excellent breakfast spot with very good coffee and of course wonderful toast .
worst pizza i ever had .
came here for brunch and it was very good friendly staff food arrived in a timely manner i love how toast supports the local art community by featuring work from local artists .
zero stars this place has no redeeming qualities whatsoever terrible food and the clientele is straight out of the hills have eyes .
i love toast my favorite café to study in also my favorite green tea and eggs benny toast .
horrible horrible customer service i literally just walked out because of the clerks attitudes never seen anything like it no thank you .
great atmosphere and great coffee .
tried a range of tapas pan tumaca churrasco arriero croquetas de jamon empanadillas de carne pimientos de piquillo rellenos they were ok but nothing that im craving to have again red wine sangria was ok not awesome .
i absolutely love toast i live by a ton of coffee shopsbrunch places and toast is my favorite very friendly staff best cup of coffee in the area and incredible bacon egg and cheese croissants a little on the pricey side but you get what you pay for .
absolute worst restaurant in manhattan terrible staff terrible food terrible time i would recommend it only to my worst enemy .
excellent coffee and nice sandwiches really good for a quick breakfast and relaxing cup of coffee the bagels are really decent and im a new yorker .
i really dont get the hype for this place the ambiance is by no means exciting and the food really isnt all that spectacular .
stumbled upon this great cafe when looking for brunch one day great egg toasts their version of eggs benedict in a variety of ways excellent coffee and espresso beverages and everyone is really friendly .
we had reservations for 10pm which was not honored we had to wait an hour before we realized we are not getting a table the host said he couldnt do anything about it which was quite disappointing .
finally a place where i can relax and enjoy the atmosphere without it costing a fortune it is very clean and cozy staff is personable great place for a lazy day or informal date .
rude rude rude service not to mention have racist signs taped to the window where you order seriously what is wrong with you people .
i have been here three times for breakfast love it the poached eggs with sausage cheddar cheese dijonnaise is great only downside is it gets hot in there when it is sunny they do not have shades to keep the sun out of your eyes .
a philadelphia classic spot but only vegetarian cheesesteaks make my menu no thanks meat eating friends enjoy theirs though but same as pats and many others in area govindas hip city veg and so many others that are better to me .
great atmosphere very clean and awesome coffee we needed a place like this for our neighborhood .
genos uses frozen gristleladen steak at least that is what it tastes like i used to be a chef at an expensive restaurant so i know what i am talking about far superior alternatives are pats joes steak and soda shop formerly chinks and tony lukes .
i have only had takeout here they make a great thin crisp pizza it rivals star tavern in orange toppings are abundant great eggplant .
the most disgusting philly cheese stake ive ever had froze ourselves to death for this garbage that we placed in to the dumpster immediately .
delicious wings delicious thin pizza love this spot to pig out .
came here after the philly marathon as i was craving philly cheesesteaks the cheesesteaks were okay nothing really special i have had better in other places also sucks theres no indoor seating when it gets colder but the fries were good .
its a good place to watch a game have a few beers and apps there is a decent menu im a fan of the buffalo blasts and the steak murphy wrap during the warmer months theres a tiki bar .
overrated i came here hoping to eat a tasty sandwich and it was far from it just plain and with no flavor the lady that takes your order seems like she hasnt smiled in decades completely disappointed .
best tacos in new haven .
gross chewy bread and racism served up hot how can you have a sign that says this is america we speak english when your staff doesnt understand an order unless its phrased 2 whiz wit go to jims .
they have a food truck which serves super mexican food theyve got seriously great food here to make it even better their prices are on point .
xenophobia and racism aside genos is still subpar at best .
cabbage no wilted soggy lettuce here just crunchy cabbage cheap huge and delicious i only get the vegan stuffs but at night i see them cutting hunks of meat down for the next morn all very fresh and everyone is always super nice .
just as shitty as pats but served with a side of xenophobic racism thanks for all the light pollution in my neighborhood genos .
this place is the best mexican in new haven the veggie tacos are flavorful and kinda healthy great rice and beans and no its not the place for romantic first date but i like watching the mexican soap opera on tv while waiting for my food .
the cheesesteaks are okay pats are better there are other good spots in the area this is a tourist trap to avoid they seem to be proudlyopenly xenophobic andor racist whats up with that .
for cheap mexican theres nothing better enchiladas mole is fantastic great service poor atmosphere but well worth it more selection than their carts .
no amount of neon and flash will make what they pass for a cheese steak any good there are so many good cheese steak options in the city and none of them are anywhere near this intersection .
love this place prices are very reasonably and food is delicious our favorites are the enchiladas for 6 including rice beans guacamole and sour cream you cant do better mostly takeout .
certainly not the best anymore but an institution none the less .
best sizetoprice ratio in a burrito in new haven handsdown without sacrificing quality bring tinfoil cause you aint finishing it .
not bad but personally i am a pats steak fan unless my steak was drench in cheese the meet was super dry i might give it another chance if i ever again visit down there .
fast inexpensive delicious and authentic mexican runs circles around the crappy excuse for mexican at fresh taco on elm st that may be fast and inexpensive but is also undelicious and inauthentic fresh sauces and very good rices and beans yum .
youre paying for the name .
the menu is huge and ive never had a bad sub here amazing customer service cheesesteaks are one of the best in jersey .
nope go to pats across the street for better quality meat more cheesesteak options on the menu and way better fries .
i was hungry and discovered this place near my bank very clean and relaxing atmosphere inside and every employee was pleasant i tried the buffalo chicken sub with jalapeños and it was awesome complete with chips and a drink it was 8 ill be returning .
real philidelphians dont eat here genos is for tourists who dont know any better or see their crappy obnoxious lights ask around the city to locals for a better place .
great product great service courteous staff clean environment they obviously care a lot about their business oh and the subs are great .
tourist trap outstanding cheese fries though .
awesome restaurant in of all places north haven ct we took the all you can eat deal and were very impressed the portions were plenty and the sushi was fresh and well presented will definitely go back and wish to try something off the very extensive regular menu .
way too expensive for what you get you can pay less elsewhere and get better food not all its cracked up to be .
ive only ever gone to formosa for the allyoucaneat special the sushi is the best around and they have great appetizers its a bit pricey so i usually make it a special occasion to go but its more than worth what you get .
im sorry all of the cheese steak places more or less taste the same i prefer jims mostly because its less of an eyesore .
amazing general chicken best ive ever had dumplings really good .
the flavor and lack of chopped preparation for the steak is a letdown for me alas ill stick with pats or dalessandros .
my favorite dish continues to be chili pepper tofu but i have had takeout and eatin across a good variety of vegetarian dishes and have never been disappointed consistently good versus occasionally great .
over rated .
pretty good all you can eat sushi was fresh and got large pieces nice atmosphere will go again .
genos englishonly sign is ignorant and unwelcoming the cheesesteak at pats right across the street tastes better anyway although i have to admit neither pats or genos was amazingly good .
ordered delivery last night and was totally impressed with the quality and taste of the food fresh flavorful and sizeable portions for a fair price and delivered quickly thanks yelpers for your reviews helped me to find this gem chicken wonton soup with spinach is a must .
typical tourist steak joint people from philadelphia do not eat here unless they are drunk at 3 a m .
get take out for lunch all the time great sushi rolls and even better dinners pricing is good and delivery is prompt .
steaks are ok not the best in philly at all but will never go there again because of joey vento and his hate mongering when he was alive .
ive been coming here with my family for years ive had some the best service on the weekdays best for lunchspecial style takeout and sushi deals .
geno steaks are not that good the place is over rated if you had to pick a place in south philly i would go with tony lucks at front and oregon .
love their chicken wonton so fresh and no mystery meat lol also try vietnam roll .
good food but overrated ate here a bunch of times but its really bad for you they make it very fast because of the long lines and dont really spend time cooking the meat correctly both pats and genos are going down the drain .
must ask for the authentic chinese menu the prices are on the expensive side but the dishes were absolutely yummy and i have pretty high standards for chinese food coming from southern ca .
ehhhh nothing compared to pats when you look at theirs next to pats its got wayyyy less meat and their wiz is more liquidy i wouldnt come back to this one when im in philly and craving a cheesesteak since pats just right across the street lol .
checked out this spot in newark staff was very friendly they gave us some bread at the table that was delicious i had the angel hair with vodka and shrimp food was great and the portion was huge for lunch time .
go for pats but i think theyre both overrated to be honest .
meatballs with angel hair al vodka 11 50 comes with small salad and bread great if youre hungry takes about 30 minutes to make call ahead .
i can get a better cheesesteak at my local pizzeria in nyc really nothing special frozen fries get rubbery after 5 minutes i really cant believe i drove down here for this maybe pats .
great sangria and atmosphere .
nope no comparison to pats and some rude ass service to boot go across the street .
if youve ever visited spain this is the place to go live flamenco every thursday and saturday night amazing tapas and sangria is on point a bit pricey but worth the money especially with the live performance .
genos is overrated its mediocre cheesesteak ive had better at a local bodega dont go here with high expectations .
we stumbled across this place and it was a wonderful delight the food was delicious and the service was great and very friendy wonderful choice of wine definitely recommend it if you get a chance .
ehhhhh the cheesesteak is forgettable definitely tourist trappy i didnt try pats so i cant compare but i probably wont go back to try them either also not a huge fan of the over the top patriotism theme going on here but to each his own .
love love love this place great vibe great food love that the plates are so small but so extremely delicious the blueberry sangria is my favorite amazing staff moved back to california i miss this place so much highly recommend .
genos is definitely an interesting place but its a tourist attraction and not a place to eat a cheesesteak if you want an actual cheesesteak find a pizza place the cheese fries are good but not really worth the price .
such a fun place for dinner especially saturdays or thursdays when they have flamenco dancers perform the food comes out pretty quickly the sangria is sweet and the staff is super helpful and eager croquettes shrimp with garlic bread with tomato and manchego and jamon all winners .
the definition of a bad cheesesteak for the locals the only reason i give them two stars is because the ordinary tourist wouldnt know any better this place is just an attraction pretty much as bad as it gets .
delicous food and friendly bartender came here on a whim on a friday night and had a great time .
tried it for the first time because of the hype really not what i expected after trying all the other cheesesteak places in philly definitely a tourist attraction usually the hole in the walls that dont have the lights glitz and glamour are way better .
one of my favorite spots in nyc the sangria is amazing and love the shrimp and meatballs .
try it just to say you had it i guess .
really good must go .
not good .
obsessed with this tapas place good food live flamenco fun times such a good place for a friday night dinner with friends .
great location for a boys ii men video you are required to speak english when ordering which is a drag go to jims on south street john goodman ate there once thats all you need to know .
delicious sangria happy hour runs until 7pm which includes 20 pitchers of sangria and 4 glasses the place itself looks quite romantic yet casual they offer a nice variation of tapas which average 7 for half serving or 14 full serving average more or less .
thumbs down i only came here to see what the fuss is all about the meat is too dry and has no flavor glad i finally got to experience genos but wouldnt recommend it .
typical east village vibe hanged out with friend over several tapas and glass of sangria variety of choices on the menu from seafood to meat and you might want to have every one of them my favorite is the braised ox tail with tropical sangria .
waste of money this cheesesteak looks like they put one slab of steakums on it the roll is good but im not paying 10 to eat a roll seriously just walk across the street and have a real cheesesteak at pats .
great tapas flamenco guitar n dancing show was fantastic its on the repeat list .
for tourists jims is better .
i went out with my wife and a family friend tonight it was awesome from the food to the setting the bartender was great and we had a great time .
the bread was chewy not in a good way the meat and onions tasted like mcdonalds they did have hot sauce which was great but they were rude dude had gross teeth and had an attitude go to rhymes with sat and starts with a p .
amazing sangrias beer tapas service atmosphere i even tried and enjoyed the sardines .
although the atmosphere can be fun gristle on a bun tourist trap have yet to find a philly native regular here .
we stumbled across this place and it was a wonderful delight the food was delicious and the service was great and very friendy wonderful choice of wine definitely recommend it if you get a chance .
below average customer service this place is wayyyyy too hyped up pats is better but height ones are impressive hell both these places should give me back the gas money i wasted going over there .
we had the patatas bravas escargot chorizo sautéed in onlions and mussels in a spicy broth overall excellent food great place for tapas cozy ambience we had the red wine sangria and the pomegranate sangria the drinks were great .
meh is right dont believe the hype these cheesesteaks are weak at best although ive had worse ive had better at many places including some of the food carts around town .
good tapas place can be a little loud but otherwise good date place recommended croquetas de pollo patatas bravas .
how do you say two dogfood sandwiches on floppy sarcones knockoff rolls please in telagu .
the food is great here so are the sangrias the service was well and i loved the entertainment it would be best to make reservations .
go to pat instead more of a real philadelphia feel than genos the proudly displayed sign of racism left a sour taste in my mouth .
good place small so make reservations we ended up eating at bar because even with a reservation it was a long wait yum tapas good drinks and if your lucky some entertainment .
how is this place even still open 0o .
really good sangria food was tasty and lots of good options there were still more items on the menu that we wanted to try more filling for your buck than most tapas places would like to return for the dancing .
can get more meat at other steakhouses in the city .
it was great .
theyre racist end of review oh and their look sucks .
good service great tapas my wife and i ordered about 5 dishes which were enough for both of us to share we went during happy hour so our drinks were cheap .
if i wanted an armpit wit cheese i would ask for it but you cant you have to order in a special language or else heavs forbid someone taint their holy earholes with a friendly hola neccessito mucho queso adicional para mi pinga .
this is a great place to eat large selection of tapas and sangria we split four tapas between two people and that was plenty the mussels and garlic shrimp were both dynamite definitely recommended and there are plenty of good spots nearby for prepost dinner drinks .
why would anyone ever want to go here dont waste the precious time you have left fellow mortal .
wonderful place friendly service came when it was 20 pitchers of sangria the food is deliciousespecially the fried goat cheese the mussels are also delicious and the blueberry champagne sangria is absolutely to die for .
just ok tourist trap nothing to return for had a better cheesesteak elsewhere tried both genos and pats and both fell short on taste .
great food awesome vibe and i would suggest making a reservation so that you dont have to wait .
i wish someone warned us that they were white supremacists pretty horrible america so speak american signs .
great food great server reasonable prices this place has it all definitely will go back .
there is only one reason to go its between 2 and 6 am youre drunk and just got out of a bar and had no luck and youre close to the restaurant otherwise stay away you can do better .
excellent portions delicious taste and reasonable pricing fabulous tapas and very tasty sangria the flamenco nights are out of this world .
not worth all the hyped over rated no flavor on the meat greasy and bland not enough cheese and onions very disappointment .
very charming place lots of good choices of sangria must haves are the garlic shrimp save some bread to soak up that sauce and chorizo dishes .
strictly for tourists .
tasty tapas with complex flavor maybe better then spain just sayin .
good hoagies awfully racist attitude this place doesnt deserve the attention it gets its definitely not the best philly steak ive had which is why im giving it two stars .
very warm and inviting place wait staf is helpful and very friendly tapas were wonderfully tasty especially the oxtail you will love nai .
i tried genos once i didnt like it stop asking me if i want to review things yelp .
awesome awesome drinks very good food we tried at least 10 dishes and were not disappointed with any we also went on a flamenco night and enjoyed the performance .
disapointment went to philly to take care of business and and eat at this place downer bread steak onions and peppers were soggy dry and not crisp service needs improvement as well .
amazing service food music cant recommend nai tapas bar more .
average steak and cheese .
all of our dishes were amazing the best ess the chorizo over playfully pepper and toast topped with fried quail egg and manchego highly recommend .
i dont understand what the heck is in the water when people think this is a great cheese steak i have had much better steves prince of steak .
great food we were in a large group and had a blast pulpo a la gallega was my favorite .
tourist place best steaks come from neighborhood places .
the food atmosphere and drinks give this place an easy four stars the service bumps it up to five the staff did an incredible job making outoftown guests feel comfortable with ordering tapas and were extremely attentive on both drinks and food love this place .
this is a tourist trap as far as i am concerned steak is tough and flavourless bread is gummy i would rather eat a sandwich that stayed together when i bit into it .
i absolutely love this place it is cozy the service is unbelievable and every single dish we ever ordered has been awesome .
no i was born and raised in philadelphia and avoid this place you can get authentic cheesesteaks elsewhwere .
great tapas place check out the pulpo a la gallego really good usually crowded service is very good as well nice staff good spot in the east village .
looks like my goto steak place is sadly failing both steak and bread were tough i think well be heading to jims and leave genos to the tourist trap industry in the future better steak better seating and better service .
it was a great experience the bartender was fun to talk with she said she was from zaragoza and very cool she recommended me great drinks the waitresses were very cool and you can have tons of fun with the food was ok the environment was wonderful .
touristtrap nonsense wrapped up in a fake rivalry dont bother .
excellent service and food my gf and i went there and it was a nice surprise great sangria and the tapas was really good .
the cheesesteak was really gross undercooked onions and the meat tasted very bland this place operates more like a factory than a cheesesteak late night place nothing authentic about genos steaks go to jims steaks .
i cant stop coming to this tapas bar certified best meatballs ive ever had in my life and the sangria is awesome not watered down or too strong great date night place with entertainment .
ass steaks .
i love this place food is great inexpensive and the flamenco really entertaining .
pats is better we got both and tasted side by side could not eat the fries they had a really nasty after taste and were under cooked i will say that the staff here is friendlier .
solid authentic spanish tapas nothing crazy or fancy just good food and great waiters .
good cheese steak and a must do for a first time or a middle of the night cheese steak .
went with a group of girls for a fun night out its the perfect atmosphere to sit drink sangria and try some tapas we absolutely loved the blueberry pomegranate champagne sangria .
tried and true this place has some friendly people however the cheese steak sandwich wasnt really the best its slightly very bland but the temperature and texture is just right worth the trip only if youre an enthusiast .
came here for my birthday dinner an had a great time not sure if the food tasted so good because of all the sangria we drank lol but i absolutely loved the meatballs patatas bravas and beef empanadas i would definitely go back .
youve got to be kidding me .
great place to eat the menu covers a wide range of food all good the service was great and the location is cozy i can not wait to go back .
so overrated and never go after any philly sporting event because that place is full of drunks peeing in the street there are so many places to get a better cheesesteak that wont give you diarrhea or heartburn .
fantastic service friendly bartenders great food and dynamite sangrias thursday night they had flamenco dancers that were just awesome definitely a regular now .
service was rude and arrogant which comes with the territory but i was hoping the cheese steak and fries would make up for it unfortunately i was disappointed .
yum great food and the sangria ay .
horrible place cheese whiz as an option should bring this down to a half star only popular because of tourist better steak shops in philly .
love this place the atmosphere service and the food were wonderful double points for the flamenco dancers who danced so amazingly i would definitely check this place out .
avoid .
great service and great food .
the wurst cheese steak sandwich ive ever had dennys makes a better cheese steak the bread taste like its out of the microwave very chewy the meat had no flavor what so ever next time i will listen to the yelp recommendation not go there .
nice selection great service and tasty food cant complain chorizo anything rocks i cant wait to go back again .
tourist trap nothing special about their food meat portion very low for the price small portion of cheese so so bread sad excuse for grilled onions .
absolutely wonderful great bottle of wine amazing tapas we had salteado de gambas mejillones rellenos pelotollas de queso de cabra esparragos rellenos churrasco arriero solomillo a la naranja all delightful service was great .
i am not sure why people love the place its very mediocre this would not make it on my top worse placed to eat if you understand what i mean .
great place very friendly good tapas good wine great performance of flamenco awesome music i didnt want to leave .
didnt really see what the big deal was i did like the cheese wiz though go during the day to avoid long lines .
a great place for music and dinner the sangria was excellent the tapas itself though hit or miss i would ask the waiter for recommendation next time .
absolute slop always has been always will be pats and genos serve up some of the worst toughest food in philadelphia .
get the blueberry pomegranate sangria the octopus and the fried goat cheese .
this place was a disappointment we took the train from ny to philly just to eat here and the bread was old and hard the cheese not even melted we ended up going to pats across the street and it was way bette than genos .
food is great been there twice the mussels are excellent with great sauce for dipping bread skip the sangria ive had better .
family of 4 none of us liked it the philly cheese steak at chase field is better haha .
excellent time my mom was visiting and she loves flamenco music and wine it was perfect we ordered the ox tailcroquetas de jamon and the calamari service was great .
just read my review of pats and just swap the name out same thing .
good tapas great service sangria was great tapas where yummy i recommend making reservations and its a good place for 2 folks to 10 folks that is all .
just about edible i live in philly and am born and raised and i have had a better steak sandwich in a neighborhood place which doesnt claim to be the best .
great drinks fantastic service and mind blowing food i definitely would come back again .
all i can say is old original does not equate to good eats skip this one .
this place is amazing delicious food great service reasonable prices .
cheesesteaks are ok cheese fries are awesome more about being there then about eating the atmosphere the pictures the lights the décor its all cool but this place is for tourists no real philly person actually frequents this place .
we went here with a group of 11 they were very accommodating the sangria was flowing and the food was amazing definitely go if you want a good show and good food .
the rolls and cheese fries are excellent the steaks are a different story my sandwich had more fat than meat .
hot steamy flamenco dance show waiter make lady happy food make me happy win .
surprisingly lame they grill then hold in a steam cabinet then regrill thats high school cafeteria shit .
great food and good sangria watch out for the old people that get pestered by big groups .
not my favorite food but its fun to take visitors .
great service and food .
a huge disappointment what an expensive sandwich for the lack of quality and amount of steak both of them are not worth more than 3 each i hang my head in shame 3000 miles for these two bad sandwiches pats and genos .
great food very nice establishment and beautiful .
cant stand the people always in the street and the racist attitude of the owners .
i love this place great food the champagne sangria is amazing and the show is really awesome def going back .
they show this place on the food channel so everyone goes ape shizz its gross spend your money at tony lukes .
great service even on a busy weekend they are an amazing staff not just one but the whole place the food was pretty decent not the best but definitely not lacking .
absolutely disgusting i didnt even want to finish the cheesesteak wit cheese is all you need to say wit with onions cheese slices of cheese 1 it smelled like pee somehow 2 it was bland 3 not much meat it was just plain bad .
i love this place the sangria is magical the food is very tasty and at a great price the bartender was awesome to talk to as we were sitting at the bar drinking sangria and eating our tapas def worth sneaking in this cozy little joint .
racist idiots terrible food .
absolutely delicious great ambiance and can usually make reservations on the weekends .
i hear the geico gekko likes it .
good tapas and sangria especially the meatballs and shrimp the grilled octopus was too mushy for my taste service can be slow when the restaurant gets packed pretty inexpensive for the quality .
genos sucks so does pats go to steves prince of steaks or tony lukes .
good food .
just dont why short change yourself into getting two small pieces of unseasoned frozen meat when you can go across the street and get a cheesesteak with actual steak in it say no to geno .
food is yummy and the sangrias are divine the wait staff is extremely helpful and awesome honestly they were so attentive and i experienced the best service .
in addition to the steaks being mediocre at best the people were extremely rude i will not come here again .
interesting tapas options and an intimate setting water boy was almost too attentive and the waiter kept bringing out more drinks even after we said we were all set thankfully he left those off the bill .
like across the street at pats .
this place is great great food great drinks and great service on a saturday night they also had great live music this is up there as one of my favorites in the city now .
id been told to come here by so people that i made the cardinal sin of not checking yelp first my bad my sandwich was awful in fact id had a tastier cheaper and healthier philly cheesesteak at charlies in the columbus airport before coming here z .
short and to the point amazing experience raul was great recommended several tapas and did not oversell good atmosphere and had no wait reservation was honored and would high endorse the experience .
i only go to pats king of steaks go ahead do a blind taste test there is no comparison .
the mango sangria is really good but might be a bit watered down the most memorable dishes were the clams mussels and meatballs all of them were really good stay away from the octopus and asparagus the octopus was slimy and the asparagus was soggy kinda gross .
hype and all flash no substance over priced got bad stomach pains tourist crap hey tourists there are way better places than pats or genos they have gotten sloppy .
funfunfun casual with great sangria yummy tapas felt like i was back in spain flamenco dancers and music a bonus .
more of a tourist attraction than a trusted local spot the steaks are greasy and fatty and make me want to gag .
very impressive selection of great tapas great music great sangria and moderate prices oh and live flamenco on thursdays and saturdays everything you need from any tapas place and mucho mas awesome .
not much to the sandwich and a lot of grissle in the meat .
a pretty good place to go to for dates as well something i didnt know before which i should have is that they have live flamenco on thursdays and saturdays definitely a place to try .
pats kings of steaks always plus they speak spanish italian and french .
the service was excellent the food was quite good especially the mussels and chorizo with onions the mango sangria was deceptively light but gave a nice buzz overall i would go again .
having once lived in the neighborhood one comes to hear stories and realizes how disgustingly racist this establishment is their steaks are no good and neither are their ethics if youre looking for an authentic philly steak try elsewhere .
we really enjoyed this restaurant the food was fresh and tasty and the service was excellent our waiter made very good suggestions as to what and how much to order i would definitely go back .
small overpriced cheese steak the staff is incredibly rude i mean maybe this is their schtick but i will not go there again btw clean up your trash .
i love this place everyone is nice they welcome you like long lost friends nai also has an excellent flamenco show and everything on the menu is awesome they even did a few great vegetarian dishes just for my husband i will always return .
another tourist trap much better steaks in philly than genos or the competing pats .
amazing food great service fun place to go one of those places you stumble upon that will stick with you forever the food is amazing and there is a great wine selection they have live flamenco shows .
pats .
great place good food and ambiance affordable prices .
pats is better did it because you have to if your in philly for the first time but will not go back they seem pretty adamant about expressing their political beliefs too nothing wrong with that but as a costumer that is a turnoff .
if i had to sum it up in 1 word it would be spectacular i loved the entire experience from the service to the decor to the foodnothing short of spectacular i will definitely come back .
racist bad cheesesteaks giving philly a bad rep dont waste your time here go to johns roast pork or tony lukes if you want a real south philly experience or even jims on south street is way better .
went with a large group had a reservation and the service was excellent it has a quaint cozy feel the staff was very friendly the food was delicious sangria very good the flamenco show was a nice touch excellent place would definitely go back .
ignorant and racist signs all over the place dont support these people .
great ambiance dancers and singers wonderful wait staff and delish food .
if you have to go to one of the tourist traps go to pats genos is overpriced and not nearly as flavorful as some of the other well known spots .
good food great service in a nice space wine selection was inexpensive and good give it a shot .
genos is a solid two stars ive always found the meat to be a bit grissly in order i prefer tony lukes jims pats then genos for a chicken cheesesteak you cant beat ishkabibbles on south street .
came here twice for the flamenco show and it was amazing the staff and delicious pitchers of sangria def will put you u in a great mood the food was good but def not as memorable as the show or the sangria .
racist sign on the front window id rather eat at pats where the service is friendly and they actually listen to your request .
amazing food service and entertainment the food was great and very reasonably priced service was attentive and the flamenco was amazing but dont go here i want to keep it all for myself .
i didnt really care for this place the staff was kinda rude and the cheesesteak wasnt that spectacular it was not enough meat and it was barely hot glad i tried it but if im ever back in philly i will just walk across the street .
great place they had awesome live spanish music with dancers food was amazing and reasonably priced .
why go to genos really why cosmis is very close to genos and is a top 5 cheesesteak i dont think either genos or pats is superior but pats isnt bright orange and doesnt have neon all over it .
great service happy hour and most importantly really good food great date spot if youre trying to impress but not break the bank .
mediocre overprice cheesesteak cheese fries are good stay away from this tourist trap go up the street to georges sandwich shop get a real cheesesteak with real cheese .
fantastic service and delicious food best tortilla espanola in the city the service is super friendly and accomodating .
tried them once and wasnt thrilled much better steaks from local pizza joints philips and dans steaks are far better and no bs with the ordering .
this place kicks ass .
visited for dinner yesterday and lunch at pats good portion and nice roll size but a bit light on the whiz and a little bland even w the onions slight edge to pats cheese fries were decent used excess cheese on sandwich .
affordable tasty food lovely wait staff great bar live flamenco musicdancing on saturday night good crowd wasnt too crowded enjoyed it very much wine was good tortilla espanola was delish .
the worst cheese steak in the city never go here .
love it great food and amazing prices fantastic staff flamenco shows killer happy hour prices ideal location what more could you want .
i was here over the weekend but i like pats better heard that teresea from long island medium was here .
first time in this place and the food was amazing the special they had was so fresh and good i tried the carapulcra and my friend had chaufinita which was really good the drive was worth it .
nothing compared to pats .
tried out their lunch specials today and their chicken with fries and rice with that amazing green hot sauce keeps me coming back .
guy dont use gloves handling my food meat was chewy although it would make decent drunk food .
walked in here unexpectedly for lunch and food was amazing they have great lunch menu so was tempted to try so glad i did its a brand new restaurant and so happy i gave it a try will be coming back .
dont waste your time standing in line you can get better steaks at random restaurants in the same neighborhood genos steaks are subpar if you want to wait in line at a famous steak place you should go to jims steaks instead at least their steaks are tasty .
a coworker and i did the side by side challenge with genos and another well known cheese steak place and we both agreed that genos was a better sandwich cost wasnt too rough and no wait at all .
genos and pats perhaps the worst quality steak you can find in philly but if you love stomach pain diarrhea standing inline with drunk idiots from out of town who dont know any better you will love this place .
respectable cheesesteak but not as good as pats .
well if you really want a cheesesteak in the italian market this is one of two alternatives better to hoof it to center city for numerous better alternatives campos for one .
dont know why the overall rating is so low but i love this place the cheese steak is really great only bad side is its kinda dry but its better than my expectations and i would definitely recommend people to come here for philly cheese steak .
my friend still went to genos after i told her not to so i asked her so was i right her response you were right nuff said .
love this place great to bring visitors from out of town really get a feel for philadelphia this way something is always happen here always buzzing .
not impressed the meat isnt very good and the bread was kinda stale i dont think i would ever eat at this place again really underwhelmed with pats and genos .
i wish that you could sit down and eat food was good .
tourist trap worst cheesesteak i have ever eaten boiled beef and onions on a bun just plain nasty .
i dont eat red meat but when i do its a cheese steak from ginos in south philly a must for a bucket list .
over rated steak meat fatty condement area fithy employees rude tourset trap .
better than pats and always a fun time waiting in line with others who are getting ready to enjoy one of the best cheesesteaks in philly .
pats is the real deal .
oh yeah this place is doing it right steak is good cheese has flavor bread is toasted all in all a steak sandwich done right tip bring cash cash only .
there are much better steaks in philly steves and jims by far better .
yum always great to eat a philly cheesesteak here a famous place even if there is a line they are on the ball wait on everyone quickly .
if you need to vomit definately eat here both times i ate here i was violently ill afterwards its a good thing i spent so much money on it or it wouldnt have been as memorable go to jims .
genos steak if youre having genos might as well try pats cheesesteak since its across from one another seems to be more modern in terms of the set up from the cash register up to the store front the long line and long tradition makes it worth while .
bad attitudes over rated food .
the best cheesesteak ive ever had fast friendly service id come here everyday if i lived nearby place is very clean but i gave them 1 less star for using ammonia glass cleaner smells horrible while eating and enjoying my cheesesteak .
save your money this is probably the worst sandwich i have ever had they barely give you any meat and they didnt even melt the cheese into the sandwich seriously you would be better off at steak and shake .
so good make sure you know what you want before you get in line .
racists .
love cheesesteaks here i like how they cut their meat thin slice and easy to chew it was tender and love onions was cook on the point the only thing is their service wasnt friendly .
its a mustexperience kind of place but the cheesesteak quality is quite sub par .
if you choose anywhere else for a philly cheese steak youre not from philly its just the way it is order correctly and enjoy .
more pomp than anything deuchey owner deceased if i want a fast food cheesesteak ill stick to pats .
every time i go to south philadelphia i make it a point to stop at both pats and to genos i love them both there is little difference between the two .
read my review for pats same thing applies here the steaks are gross .
yummm love their cheese steaks best in philly .
overrated over priced tourist trap the food is ok at best .
we loved genos steaks were going tomorrow .
ive have better cheesesteaks in suburban boston how disappointing btw this is the 21st century take credit cards .
i have to say not passing judgment but from out of state and had to try both sandwiches from genos and pats i enjoyed both places for grub maybe on my next return ill get scoop from locals .
not a fan i like my steak chopped up and with condiments on them when i go to sit down and eat .
went to pats for years loved em but recently they use very little meat and it was dry at that needed my cheesesteak fix and went to genos didnt expect it to blow pats away but it did .
ew gross jims on south .
hands down the greatest steak in philadelphia or the world for that matter the key is they dont cut up their meat they keep the steak in strips and that paired with the delicious amoroso rolls makes it irresistible .
tourist trap tastes like youre eating rubber on a bun .
amazing cheesesteaks friendliest people serving you if you can get over the fact that they dont offer a1 or bbq sauce then youre all set .
not a fan of genos or pats they were both either rubbery or dry and the amt of stk used is very little .
2nd best friggin steak in south philly eat it .
hit pats across the street genos is all flash 2 best words to describe this place tourist attraction .
steaks are better than pats fries are better at pats genos has better soda both cash only both get packed but its worth a try for sure get with onions and wiz .
ive gotten better cheesesteaks at jersey mikes even as a tourist im new to philly from the south this is disgusting generic bland possibly stale bread dry chopped bland steak and for what you get it is way overpriced .
come on people its fun the food is alright but most importantly its fun and a must so philly experience dirty and over priced but worth it eat one at pats too do both in 25 min its a guy challenge .
late night drunk food fights in line while waiting no thanks the steaks arent that great either .
pros the bread was delicious and the sweet peppers were tasty cons not enough cheese the steak wasnt as plentiful as one would have hoped when they visit a renowned establishment such as genos they only accept cash .
worst steaks in philly save your money save your wasteline and try eating from a real cheesesteak place .
genos cheese steaks are what they are a staple in south philly and a dam great cheese steak now with that being said i need a cheese stake right now going to genos .
i wish this place would just shut down and save electricity .
i ordered from both pats and genos steak shops for dinner both the food and experience was good at both shops but i liked pats better before ordering it is a good idea to look over the menus for options and remember to say yes to onions .
pats is better and i only give pats 3 stars .
genos is not the original pats across the street is however genos is usually cleaner in the outside eating area try both and compare for yourself .
i am a pats girl sorry folks the steak is too thick and it looks like the steak you get of out of the freezer .
this is the real deal and was by far the best cheesesteak ive ever had as long as you know what to expect you cant help but give this place 5 stars .
the cheesesteak was not good rather dry and flavorless the business is also pretty racist and goes beyond patriotism to something quite offensive not worth waiting in line for and theres not much space to enjoy your food once youve gotten it .
when in philly you have to go to genos not only for the delicious cheese steak but also to say you have been to genos .
gross its a tourist attraction but they do not make good cheeseteaks .
amazing place .
purely for the pats v genos debate i prefer jims on south .
genos is much better than pats meat has flavor and not chewy the bread also makes a big difference hands down geno .
cold meat unmelted cheese rude staff there are probably a thousand better cheesesteak places in the city i have no reason to ever return to this place .
yummers nuff said .
food was ok employees friendly but they are racist and generalize which was disrespectful for them to be an attraction of pa big no no .
tried both genos and pats both are equally good .
this is a definite tourist trap and locals really only hit it up late night when they are extremely drunk and nothing else is open i have had better cheese steaks around town overpriced greasy and gross .
we bought one from here and one from pats this cheesesteak was far superior i liked the bread the cheese and the meat better the meat is cutuch better and more chese is used at genos overall yum on a bun .
always great people watching especially late night the drunker you are the better the steaks still even sfaced not that great whatever do it once and make your own opinion its worth the experience at least .
watched this on a tv network when i was still living in my native country i didnt let it pass when i got a chance to request where i wanted to it and its at genos their cheese steak is simply tasty .
tourist trap plenty of better options elsewhere .
a bit pricey but the steak meat used is very good quality and steaks are done very consistently menu is limited but these guys are geared to move product get your steak whiz with and dont dillydally in line .
pats and genos are philadelphia institutions terrible terrible institutions save the calories if you are a tourist go here for the experience then promptly go somewhere else for your cheesesteak .
while i believe most philadelphia residents are over the whole pats vs genos thing and know very well that they can find similar or better cheesesteaks elsewhere i still have to admit that genos despite their politics is the better of the two at this particular intersection .
genos used to be great the last time i went there the meat in the sandwich had a lot of fat in it i wont go back .
i havent been there in a few years but last time i was there it was good could have used a little more meat on the roll and a few less gd tourists at the window kind of pricy but the ingredients are good .
tourist trap on to the next one .
you gotta try both of em once .
highly over rated both ginos and pats .
oh hell yes .
having tried both places genos is definitely much better than pats compared to what else the city has to offer however genos just doesnt cut it .
stopped in while on vacation parking is rough if you cant parallel park your screwed not a ton of places to sit but just meet some new friends sandwiches are amazing and totally worth the trip .
noone goes here but friends family and tourists .
always love genos steaks definatly go there careful the hot sauce its hot and i like spicy .
genos has one of the worst steaks in philly and the owner seems like a xenophobic jerk to boot so yeah dont go here .
best cheesesteak in the world great owner god bless him just order and taste for yourself enough said .
come bye to take a photo then go and get a better cheese steak somewhere else there is nothing special about these steaks and they are 9 bucks not worth the trip .
love this place .
eek methinks not if you are a true philadelphian you know that the best cheesesteaks can only be found at your local corner store and youd never wait in line for a 10 dollars steaks nuff said .
yep great place classic what you can come to expect from a solid philadelphia cheese steak joint .
chewy bread tough steak not enough cheese whiz .
prefer it to pats cant say why .
bland dry steak is seldom better when you serve it up with a side of racism pats by far and if youre local try jims or tony lukes .
genos over pats everyday all day but steves prince of steaks in the northeast is still the best .
worse than pats .
their bread was soggy but the meat on point delicious better than pats king of steaks did a taste check with celina and steve between geno and pats king of steaks and geno takes my vote .
a bunch of racist bigots that sell sloppy cheese steaks tourists only .
whenever im in town its one of the spots i have to go good steaks good prices and you gotta love being in s philly lifelong fan .
overrated jims steaks in west philly and tony lukes are waaaaaaay better .
this place has the very best cheese steaks in philly other then pats either way i cant go wrong .
interesting ambiance but the food quality is like the customer service rough steak was dry and mystery meatlike provolone was paltry the bread was ok .
win we did the taste comparison to pats and genos wins hands down the meat taste like its better quality and the people were super friendly i was visiting from cali and the nice guy gave me a pen for a souvenir .
rude gross done .
great steaks great philly vibe i would definitely go there againrecommend to a friend .
not good at all i dont know why ppl go there no taste no salt no pepper no dressing nothing just the meat and the cheese .
great .
touristy average quality long lines and wait time .
its good when your hungry after a night out .
genos and pats for that matter is just the philly posterboy for cheesesteaks there are 8 million places that are infinitely better all over the city .
good and yes sometimes its better than pats but pats is still better by default at this point .
this is the epitome of a tourist trap try tony lukes instead .
cool vibe real south philly cheesesteaks this is a fun place with pictures all over the walls of celebrities from the past til now who have been to ginos .
ive lived in philly long enough to know that genos is a low quality overly greasy cheesesteak unless youre starving and walking by it dont bother there are a ton better places for a cheesesteak in the city .
you cant go wrong with wiz wit and an order of cheese fries its a place that anyone living in philly or visiting philly should visit at least once .
disappointing meat didnt taste great and wasnt chopped enough pats across the triangle was better but both were disappointing save your witwitout wiz onions and peppers requests for jims steaks or one of fifty other places around these tourists traps are simply for tourists .
its the classic philly cheesesteak what more can you say ya gotta go i cant decide between here and pats theyre both damn good and pretty similar go to both you decide .
its gross and theyre prejudiced people if you have to get a cheesesteak go to jims .
equally authentic as pats i love it just as much .
crap steaks and worse service all because theyre overhyped never again .
i know its a tourist trap and i dont like the signs either but i love love love these cheese steaks and i am not ashamed to yelp it its a must have any time i am in philly .
food 3 5 service 1 5 value 2 .
a philly original .
standard cheesesteak in philly meat is bland flavor less and bread is stale good thing this place is a tourist trap so genos will continue to make money .
great sandwich and cheese fries bread is amazing will stop there on my next trip surprised it has a 2 5 star rating deserves better .
overrated no seasoning and the bread was oily and stale this place is just hyped up by the food shows and tourists flock over here .
we go here consistently every year its definitely a winner .
if one place could ruin my love of cheesesteaks genos would be it there was minimal meat cheese and onions genos bread was slightly better than pats but overall it was lackluster i also dont understand why you need to order fries at a separate window .
awesome .
at least i can say i ate here but it was a waste of money this place is a tourist trap there was more bread than meat nothing tasted seasoned if i ever visit philly genos would never get my money again .
good not great gets 4 stars for the history .
for all the hype just pretty average .
definitely gotta hit up genos every we come to philly gotta order the philly cheesesteak with onion and cheese wiz .
what a disappointment in taste quality visualappeal hygiene and customer service pats was dramatically better in every category as we tried them at the same time why this place is famous at all completely confuses me .
soft bread excellent overall steak and cheese whiz wit .
i had to go through philly bc i missed my flight to nyc so i decided to try this place out dont know what the hype is about the meat was dry and not much flavor .
great steaks .
very little meat and not much flavor the frys were bland as well i rather go to pats .
im personally a pats fan but its a cheesesteak so of course its good pro tip know your order and have cash at the ready .
this establishment is proud of being racist need i say more last time i checked this was the city of brotherly love .
not necessarily the best but no complaints .
wow that was marginal was not worth the attitude or money a true food factory though from the time to order and get our subs three minutes great philly cheesesteaks the kiosks in front of home depot .
its not as good as jims but good enough to be famous .
pats beat genos hands down how is this even a competition pats is more flavorful more moist and i feel like its got more meat to bread ratio i had to add a bunch of hot sauce to genos sandwich just to finish it .
neither one patsgenos is perfect for my favorite steak in philly i choose jims but if im in the area and have to choose i choose genos they are cleaner and they have better meat .
im paying for a meh cheesesteak not obnoxious smallminded ethnocentric propaganda .
this place is the best it has the best philly chesesteaks ive ever had no visit to philly is complete without visiting genos .
its historical and all but if you want a real steak go to tony lukes thats where it is at to get a philly steak .
delicious a little out of the way to get here but definitely a good try .
tough tasteless meat stale bread rude service and xenophobes oh and grossly overpriced just stay away .
best steak in town its all i want when i am traveling to philly wiz on the steak and wiz on the fries 1 in philly hands down .
1 for rude staff 1 because ive had better in nyc 1 for ignorant signs 1 for the bread 1 because of pats across the street which is marginally better enough said .
good stuff but its a definitely a tourist cheese steak .
the cheapest white bread roll poisonous cheese wiz and apathetic expectant employees im eating a cheesesteak in the airport right now that is 100 times better dont waste your time only redeeming value is that geno supports the troops .
i love going here after a concert or a ball game in the city ive heard the staff can have an attitude but i have yet to experience that tasty cheesesteaks from ginos are the perfect late night meal .
tourist trap small greasy steaks .
geno the owner is fantastic he is not a nazi and hes a great tipper learn how to order your cheesesteaks before you come in they move fast thats their tradition give them some love .
really not that great staff isnt rude but not nice steaks are ok and the neon racism is just un called for .
oh come on most of the 1 and 2 star reviews are a little harsh its 3 5 star food and a bonus 5 for the checkthebox .
would rather rate this place a zero one word tasteless dont waste your time and money coming here pats is by far a better place hands down .
great first time ever came from puerto rico and did the taste test both genos and pat have their unique style and both taste awesome .
if you want an overpriced blend and most of all sh tty cheese steak this is the place to go also racist xenophobic and homophobic sorry for the all caps just wanted to give everyone a fair warning wooohoo .
awesome .
pass on this one find a street vendor .
quick service sliced steak with american cheese nice bun very filling liked this better than pats .
this is the epitome of tourist trap pats has at least a passable product genos is the pits bad chewy meat not enough cheese and a heaping serving of xenophobia .
steves prince of steaks is actually the best and now that there is a center city location i am ecstatic they both lack in meat but the taste makes up for it .
please go to by george in the reading terminal market better service and food no rude person taking your money and you can use a bathroom fu cash register window lady so rude to everyone .
i am personally choose pats over genos but you really cant go wrong with either .
genos has lost the cheesesteak battle against pats rude cashierfolks bad tasting cheesesteak bland meat no taste in cheese clean er environment than pats okay pricing for size revisit not i .
great stop after a concert or event in south philly gotta learn the lingo so they get the order right nonstop battle with their neighbor pats for the crown of best philly cheesesteak .
very touristy but a fun experience .
i prefer pats but i wont ever turn down the chance to come here if someone wants to go always wiz wit good for breakfast brunch lunch dinner late night dessert .
we went because it was a must in the cheesesteak war but i am glad we also had a pats sandwich which i liked more genos was just ok .
the lines are outrageous but the cheesesteak makes that ok have your cash ready and be willing to answer the milliondollar question wid see south philly accent for more information on that good sandwich for about 8 .
owner is a douche and pats is better .
i love there stakes hum hum good .
meh skip with endless options for cheesesteaks in philly this one is not worth the trip the bread was not particularly great and the meat was very fatty rudeapathetic service soggy sandwich and overall underwhelming of the two pats is definitely better .
i was certainly worth the wait even though the line was wrapped around the block it went very quickly certainly representative of a real philly cheesesteak if youre in the area it is definitely worth a look see .
booooooooo pats is better .
genos is good but pats is definitely better but try both and judge for yourself .
dont drink the koolaid as many yelps have already reiterated the rankings of pats genos as the best place for philly cheese stakes is nothing short of a long standing marketing hoax save your money and go to jims on south street for a decent steak .
ah the famous who does it best i definitely liked the cheesesteak here i really wish they could have an enclosed awning during the winter when i went it was freezing .
very disappointed with genos the cheesesteak was not seasoned the onions were raw and we asked for provolone and there was a small amount of cheese .
im a vegetarian and i liked it because they made me the best veggie sandwich .
was not impressed when i tried genos the meat was dry and the service wasnt that great i wish my first philly cheesesteak experience was better but i was disappointed .
genos was better than pats wouldnt drive to do it again but coming from dc made for an interesting trip .
bread was hard and seemed either stale or not fresh they didnt have green peppers the meat was dry i threw half of it away this place was really disappointing .
you have to stand in line and try this philadelphia landmark the sandwich was great and it was worth the wait do yourself a favor and stop by .
sorry genos but pats has a better cheesesteak i did add hotsauce to to the cheesesteak thought i was going to die so that may have distracted me from the actual cheesesteak itself i can say genos fries are better than pats .
best philly cheesesteak ever went here my familys friend took us here we stood in a crazy line but it took us only like 10 minutes to get the cheese steaks greasy but soooo damn good we wanted to come back for more .
cheesesteak just okay but cheese fries was hella good .
tried the original cheesesteak with wiz meat was less tough and juicier than pats genos you win eh 4 stars is still being generous though 3 5 .
i can get a better cheese steak at some ghetto corner store overpriced tasteless and tough to chew this place is just living off of the tourists who are not smart enough to realize they are paying for overpriced slop .
my first trip to philadelphia came here to get the cheese steak one of the best sandwiches i had even though it was rather greasy .
the meat was a bit gummy and way too much fat on it i liked pats better than this place go to pats instead its right across the street and if youre looking cute the guys working there will let you know so .
yummy steaks and soft bread i like the cheese and effeciency of the workers making my sandwhich its not gourmet its a steak shop and they taste great .
epic fail half raw meat on stale bread who comes back and eats this stuff or is it just tourists who like neon lights go to jims on south street or chinks for a real cheesesteak .
my favorite parts are 1 the line is long but moves fast 2 the people working there move fast 3 their cheesesteaks are the best in philly and 4 you must order in english .
this shit was horrible bland dry meat on some break smh they onl get business due to the history smh and they charge too much annddd they are rude .
many steaks later this is my first time here compared to all of the others genos is just as good the rolls are not as good as tony lukes but they make up for it with mucho meat go eat one .
utter disappointment heard about this place from food network and saw all the lines so i expected some authentic cheesesteak that would blow me away boy was i wrong meat was flavorless thin and rubbery bread was soggy nothing special at all .
my husband and i did our own food test between pats cheesesteaks and genos cheesesteaks genos was much better the meat was more flavorful and it was just a much better cheesesteak than pats .
a dry slab of steak between even drier salty bread yum .
yummy and customer service is much better then pats i found their cheese steak flavorful and after tasting this location and pats my group of friends also agreed this was the better of the two locations .
one of the most overrated places in the city the steaks are mediocre at best i can name ten places i would rather get a cheese steak from and the service there is horrible .
this is a really good sandwich you cant go wrong here in my humble opinion i would still choose the other guys across the street pats but this is still a great sandwich nonetheless .
genos has better bread than pats but thats about it in the pats vs genos rivalry pats wins .
i love going to genos steaks yes i know its touristy but who cares its a great experience and a solid cheesesteak from authentic south philly folks pats across the street is good too but i still prefer genos even though im in the minority .
terrible service terrible food and terrible atmosphere only english spoken here oh i no speaky engrish guess ill take my business elsewhere .
sorry folks but im a genos fan .
its overpriced the light bill must be astronomical here its all lights and fluff from the celebrity pics i would take a pic and say hey ive been there and get a cheesesteak elsewhere i should have spent my 10 dollars elsewhere i wouldnt recommend .
love it got to go to this place .
really bad served with a healthy side of attitude nothing can save this place just bad elaborating anymore will just give me agita .
above average cheesesteak i didnt go to pats so im only comparing it to previous cheesesteaks ive had steak was cooked well and the bread was super fresh .
pats vs genos pats by far the provolone cheesesteak sandwich was very dry and bland the meat was flavorless .
loved it worth the trip to south philly to try genos for the first time cheesesteak wit with whiz was perfect also tried pats too which was across the street to properly compare the two places .
i was so sickened by the antiimmigrant signage i ended up ditching my sandwich and heading across the street this place is so rightwing that they refer to their fries as freedom fries unwelcoming atmosphere overall skip it .
genos is a great place to stop after a phillys game dont let the line intimidate you it moves quickly .
i just dont get it why people are so crazy about this philly cheese steak i wont mind the line and the jammed pack intersection it reminds me of the philly cheese steak at a bad food court .
steak sandwich was delicious but the fries werent as good as pats the cheese whiz at genos was better but my family convinced me to go with pats enjoyed both places though philly is lucky to have the two duking it out in there streets .
i deeply regret eating here a few hours after consuming the greasy cheese steak an unbearable unsettling pain developed in my stomach i threw up in addition to its low quality ingredients coated in grease the location is less than ideal avoid this place at all costs .
you cant miss the lights or the 200 people waiting in line wish i could of got double meat but their way has been working all these years who am i to change it up get the cheese fries too .
this place is an eye sore and there cheese steak wasnt that good and they have no public bathrooms is that even legal .
i love genos every time i go to philly we stop here definitely better than pats in my opinion .
i came to philly to try the authentic philly steak cash only 9 final thoughts delicious but pretty plain the bread was soft but i wish it was toasted the sandwich was composed of only sliced steak and grilled onions thats it overall it was a boring sandwich .
out of my top 3 favorite philly cheesesteak places genos ranks 2nd the roll is always soft and my wiz wit is always consistently good i also love their cheese fries .
good but what really makes it is the roll .
the cheesesteaks are really good the line is long .
i wish i could have mixed genos and pats genos had thicker meat super moist and cheesy but didnt really have any flavor and the attitude yea im from nyc and even i say thank you and please to the rudest of people .
i tried the big 3 genos pats and jims on south st but genos won by a landslide .
our first stop during our food crawl trip to nyc tried both genos and pats both were mediocre and definitely not worth the detour should have relied on yelp in lieu of tv shows .
not only is it a philly institution its called genos what more you want .
wow this was really bad lukewarm meat on an average roll ordered american cheese cheese was put on cold roll with warmish meat cheese did not melt same problem at pats go to steves prince of steaks or ishkabibbles .
my first philly cheese steak experience had a whiz wit and it was dam good the meat wasnt cut up and it wasnt all greasy like pats the bread held everything together perfectly .
just okay i think i prefer my meat chopped up i liked their hot sauce very hot obviously xenophobia is hard to swallow even with a nice helping of wiz and onions im glad i tried it but ill stick with jims .
perfection melts in your mouth gotta get it with cheese wiz if your not from the area skip the sides and just get 2 sandwiches you will never have another one like it .
i give 1 star for the lights and 1 star for yelling at me after i bought a cheesesteak from you ive had cheesesteak in california better then genos in fact i bet ill make a better cheesesteak then genos definitely overhyped .
with out a doubt beats pats out the water .
go else where for a cheesesteak there are better options the regular sandwich has a soso bun and the meat was dry the fries were average overrated went there based on the name only go else where .
i went a few weeks ago with some friends the food was good the service was very fast im not a fan of the lack of seating long lines but overall a must for philadelphians and tourists .
cold and chewy cheesesteak got it within 5 seconds of ordering cash only 9 pat vs genos none both suck .
love their cheese fries .
if you like bad cheese steaks and racists this is the place for you if not go somewhere else .
line is long but moves fast good steaks deserving 4 stats but we prefer pats .
cheesesteaks arent my thing but this place was okay the wait in the cold the cash only and the xenophobia of this place arent worth what you get and especially what youre paying for .
i dont think ive ever eaten as fast as i did here got the philly cheese steak with american cheese onions a few minutes after ordering the line was super long the only bad thing is limited seating and gaudy lights .
went all the way to philadelphia for this so disapointed guess ill go run the rocky stairs .
i have to give genos a slight edge over pats we did the taste test and genos roll was fresher and they serve coke products .
i used to be a genos guy but it seems just ok i would not drive out of my way to come here again disappointing what happened .
sandwich was very good didnt like it as much with provolone cheese versus the cheese whiz id prefer extra cheese though the bread was very good also soft but still firm enough to hold the juice from the meat .
not a fan for many many reasons .
wiz with need i say more .
crap tourist trap not filling the best thing on the menu are the cheese fries ive had better philly cheese steaks in ft lauderdale .
too close to call genos and that other place are both very good and worth the trip got two wit and wiz very good .
had just the standard philly cheesesteak wasnt impressed it also made me a bit sour that they just had the sandwich sitting there at the window and slid it over to me the meat wasnt very flavorful and the cheese was meh too .
better than pats .
if you are around this way and want a cheese steak just go to pats not they they are much better but they are by a little .
very good just pricey for what youre getting .
fuck this place bad food and bad service fuck the all the minimum wage workers that work there cuz they all got bad attitudes .
i liked it better than pats bigger and better .
very disappointing tasted like stakeum with cheese wiz anyone who can even cook just a little can make a better philly at home i just dont get all the hype the owner was very rude he has lost his passion if he ever had any .
great fresh bread from local bakery and super moist and tasty love it .
sandwich is boring and thats being nice the decor is great if youre a racist or just plain hate those who may be different from you .
genos i miss you so much and i think about you all the time like many thousands of people before me i visited phili and did the obligatory sidebyside comparison with pats to me there was no contest genos wins without a doubt .
rude cashier and a 9 meh sandwich man v food you have failed me if i make it back to philly ill try pats .
great cheesesteaks nomnomnom .
i went here on my last trip to philly it was pretty decent couldnt complain but i think pats tasted a little better its not as crowded as pats but it is cleaner for sure all in all it was a cheesesteak but jims is way better .
all time best cheesesteaks wiz wit sorry pats fans im all about the cheese on the bottom of my steak for whatever reason ah the college memories of standing in this line at 2 am im getting hungry just reminiscing about it .
geno you are not american im probably not the first to say this nor will i be the last your steaks are good but i will not go back due to your preference to be a jerk to nonlocals and your bike shop sucks .
im not a huge fan of the bigger slices of steak but it works within the sandwich the seasoning they put on the meat might give them the edge but the folks working there are dbags .
racist bastard .
went for breakfast while in town the lady at the register was very courteous and my cheesesteak was made pretty quickly benches are outside the shop for customers as well as condiments loved seeing the englishonly signs this place is what america is all about .
the steak here was skinny flanks that was bland in flavor try pats king of steaks instead .
after eating a 9 cheasesteak places in 2 dasy genos is it the bread had a unique flavor and differently soft the flavor of the meat and wiz was great .
terrible service terrible cheesesteak terrible .
they say this is a tourist steak place but i disagree i always get the wiz with out and i love it never had a bad steak here .
the line is way to long for this place i tried genos and went right across the street to try pats to decide which was better and i think pats is .
genos vs pats genos .
very disappointed stopped by phila on the way to ac shouldnt have wasted gas the bun was cold meat was very average at best i was expecting much more but i guess it more of a tourist trap .
wiz with wiz fries make even the longest road trip seem so far away in my mind thank you genos for bringin it when i needed it the most .
the cheesesteak was gross the bright lights were annoying and the decor was blatantly xenophobic .
the sandwich and cheese fries are on point they just have terrible customer service they act like you the customer owes them something what a shame because the food is pretty good .
ugh .
i just came back to philly from dc if you want a more juicier and less saltier tasting cheese steak go to genos way better then pats the fries were ok i would defintly go back for the cheese steak .
toooooo much hype the food has no flavor .
the legend what else can i say pure steaky cheesey oniony ambrosia bread is perfect steaks are perfect i got mine with onions and american instead of the goopy cheez wiz definitely a bucket list stop .
this place sucked dont believe the hype i tried both and pats is way better then genos but i will never come from ny for either again i make better at home what a let down .
legendary cheesesteak house competing with pats on the facing corner as for me i prefer genos to pats i think the cheesesteaks are better the only way to know for yourself is to try it yourself .
highly overpriced and overrated pats has a better cheesesteak even though they are overrated as well i also heard this place is racist .
well to answer the big question yes it was worth the trip my first ever philly cheesesteak and it did not disappoint at all be prepared for a little bit of a wait but it is well worth it .
i live 1 block from genos and i have only been there once even when im drunk and starvin i will never go back it is the most tasteless food i have ever had .
as all other people i tested the genospats rivalry pats asked for the order and gave it to me before i even finished my order genos on the other hand granted my request similar steaks but id go with genos .
staff is so arrogant and rude standed on line outside and stunk of their mediocre food there are plenty of other places to get a better cheesesteak without the attitude thumbs down .
had some pats and immediately walked across to genos to compare gotta give to to genos by a nose but i prefer the classic feel of pats .
checked out the website heard the stories ginos is a bigot and very arguably a racist do not support this establishment i sloppily finished my pats sub at ginos in silent protest .
genos is the best way better than pats and the people that work there are really nice too its the best with prov onions a tad of hot sauce and ketchup mustard yum .
it happens all the time whenever a successful business is created someone rips it off with a crappier model right next door and steals 10 of their market share if you usually prefer the fake over the original youll probably love genos .
sup with the bad reviews 2nd best steak in philly under jims .
not even good drunk 2am .
i tried both pats and genos on the same night just to keep the taste test fair genos was better imo the meat was more flavorful that was the major difference they were both good but genos was just a bit better .
sorry genos but in a side by side taste test pats won genos bread is better than pats but overall the whole package just didnt cut it .
tried both genos and pats im a fan of genos sliced meat yummy bread and cheesewhiz .
as a lifelong pats fan im reminded of the immortal words of blair waldorf you are disgusting and i hate you .
i like i like definately better than a pats i will get everytime i am in philly by the way the difference is tiny they are both good cheese whiz wit and a diet coke .
onions are good but this place is pretty pedestrian not a fan of the sheets of meat either i guess its in business because of suckers like me from out of town shoulda just gone to jerrys .
the best either way their both fantastic just make sure you know what you are going to order before you get up to the window .
pats across the street is much better these are just sub par to ok not really worth the hype imo .
personally i think this is better than pats the hot sauce is phenomenal .
i waited until i tried both pats and genos to write my review and im going to have to side with pats genos wasnt horrible as i have had worse cheesesteaks in my life but the steak at pats was juicier and wasnt overpowered by the cheese .
as good as it gets for a sliced cheesesteak although i prefer chopped american wit nuf said .
it was ok did not live up to the hype ive had better cheese steaks at the jersey shore the peppers and onions are from jars not fresh very disapointing .
im not a cheesesteak expert i loved every cheesesteak i tried in philly this one was good because the line moved really quickly .
checked out both pats and genos not sure what the big deal is no flavor all i can say great tourist trap .
good cheese steaks at a good price .
genos pats are slightly different but both are pretty sloppy and not that great plenty of restaurants have them beat in quality service tastiness you only go here for the experience because they claim to be the original philly steak .
best cheesesteak i have ever had quick service great staff geno still works 7 days a week he was there and took pictures with patrons great stop .
i find that those small carts throughout center city makes a better cheesesteak than genos .
the best in the land no matter where i go genos is still the best anywhere .
this place is not good i was not impressed i ate here with three other people who have traveled many places and we could not see how anyone thought this was good i would rather get a double cheesburger from burger king it would be more satisifing .
have done a taste test between this and pats twice i would have to say that meat is by far more lean and the bread rocks over their direct competitors always a line though for good reason of course .
i speak perfect english and not only will i not order in english here i wont order at all pats across the street delivers steak sandwiches fine without accompany xenophobia very few americans have ancestors who could have ordered at genos without discrimination along wit it .
second best fries after ishkabibbles and they are ohsocravable .
also totally ok bland but better bread than pat kings unless you like soggy bread .
mmmm they do not hide behind flashy lights genos wins in my book .
i think they are both overrated but pats was my clear choice although i liked the fries and pictures in front of genos even though i give a low rating this is a must see and this texan tourist still enjoyed the taste test .
genos is an institution in philadelphia i love a place that has direct competition across the street pats but still remains and considers cheese whiz a food group the cheese steaks are tasty if you are ever in philly try genos .
we usually go to pats across the street .
i need to reiterate how amazing this place is i am adding two words to my previous review cheese fries .
sometimes i like to take friends and family who have never been and get one from pats and one from here and see which they like best its fun just dont forget and take a steak over to the other area youll get bood out of the place .
genos pats whats the difference i grew up on this slop and it still tastes the same regardless of what cheesewiz they use .
the cheesesteaks here are terrible .
if you have a cheesesteak at lunch you wont need to have dinner .
the atmosphere and tradition are the reasons for the two stars i was not very impressed with the actual food seems like there was too much bread and not enough meat on the sandwich will try pats across the street next time .
the wiz w cheese steak what can i say ummmm yummmmy .
worse than pats is having said been there done that really worth a crappy overpriced sandwich when there are so many better options in this city i dunno good things cheese fries and hours bad things pretty much everything else .
hottest steaks in the illadelph .
overrated overrated chant it with me next time im in philly im going to try some of the local spots this place is for tourists cheese fries were money though .
this place is so good but not enough people go here help support them they have amazing food and service .
love their cheese fries but their steaks send me straight to the bathroom tmi but true lol dont forget you must order in english at genos haha .
love it take out is quick and always hits the spot owner is super friendly and if you bite the bullet the thai spicy burns in all the right ways brown rice is extra though .
genos is better than pats but in all honesty these cheesesteaks arent that awesome bland meat low quality bread and processed cheese meh .
i normally dont like any type of coconut curry but man the red curry here was on point yum .
your review helps others learn about great local businesses please dont review this business if you received a freebie for writing this review or if youre connected in any way to the owner or employees .
warm intimate authentic food served by husband and wife owners small menu allows the kitchen to really shine impeccable service that obliges both causal groups and the many dates that the new york style dining room invites must eat meatballs green curry fried rice pad kee mao .
super excited about trying a famous genos philly cheesesteak unless their horrible cafeteria food is the definition of an iconic sandwich pats right across the street was better but still was quite atrocious we stayed in and cooked cheesesteaks the next night .
i visited last week the food was delicious i ordered the lemongrass soup and the pad thai very tasty and lovely presentation i definitely would recommend it .
theres a reason we call philadelphia murdelphia or killadelphia because if you dont get shot well kill you with artery clogging tourist traps such as genos not to mention that the service is ridiculously almost comically rude .
great food nice atmosphere will be coming back .
this place is bogus the rolls are bad the meat is bad the circus lights are horrible take a pass on this if youre from out of town dont judge a cheesesteak by eating one of the monstrosities .
enjoy your meal with cool place cool service cool price the food was delicious and seem like you have dinner in thailand both of boss khun tom khun ann are very nice they take care every clients by themselves its great have a worth dinning today .
dont even bother not worth the hype .
very yummy it was my first time eating thai food so i stuck with what i knew fried rice i had the beef fried rice and it was so good my hubby had duck and it too was great overall great .
we checked this out immediately after grabbing a sandwich from pats while their wall of celebrity pics was impressive their sandwich was less impressive i liked the quality of their bread a little more but the meat was drier than pats i wouldnt go back .
we live in ca so we eat thai food all the time the noodles at this place are so tender i cant believe it good curry and one of the friendliest waitstaff ever .
the question of all questions pats or genos and the answer they both suck .
most likely the nicest owners of an establishment ive met they are so caring and will go very much out of the way for you i love the pad see ew and my boss always has the roasted duck .
decent cheesesteak a little dry though for my tastes .
always a winner great wellpriced food and super friendly service byob phad thai and crispy duck are always good .
i know its a philly institution its long lost its quaintness the cheesesteaks are mediocre wit or witout and its really out of the way trust me cheese whiz does not make a cheesesteak great quite the contrary .
it little cafe which have great food awesome green curry and shrimpburi salad if you want smt exotic tasty u will find it here love it .
is the cheesesteak really any different from pats hm no is this place just downright obnoxious a definite yes .
very very good restaurant the food was sooo good and the service was great too definitely coming back again .
so effing expensive so effing racist better than pats on taste but i mean thats not saying much if your view of cheesesteaks is so myopic it just considers these two touristridden disasters both places give me diarrhea .
incredibly friendly service and owners homemade authentic food and a warm interior make for an excellent experience i love everything about this place they also are very conscious of vegetarian vegan and glutenfree needs .
all you need to know about genos is across the street at pats no comparison pats is the best do yourself a favor and head across the street .
just loved everything i ate in this restaurent chicken satay green curry are unforgettable .
my fiance and i tried genos after experiencing the awesomeness at pats genos does not even compare to pats genos steak was chewy and fatty the fries were soggy and disgusting next time we go pats it is .
excellent pad thai delicious thai iced tea definitely recommend very small space doubt they can accommodate more than 6 in a table nice people slow waiters .
steak is good needs better bread not the right ratio .
its a really cute little cozy place with super friendly staff and very prompt service the food was very good as well no complaints .
good steaks or not this establishment is owned and operated by a xenophobic racist piece of shit do not patronize these cocksuckers go to pats .
we just left after enjoying an amazing lunch chicken shrimp fried rice and chicken stir fry mindy was sweet and was very attentitive plus the entire menu and thai tea was the best .
between pats and genos pats is the winner sorry genos but i dislike your neon lights and your hard bread in comparison to pats plus you were mean to my friends friend nadsbakery com201005d… .
very good thai food one of our favorite neighborhood spots love that it is a byob .
rude owner and employees never make up for halfway decent food .
update i cannot tell you how much i love this place .
not worth going out of your way .
pad thai was delicious and service was excellent .
awful the only place worse is across the street at pats if youre from philadelphia or have lived in philadelphia you wouldnt be caught dead at this intersection .
fantastic experience with a group of six on saturday night staff was great food was fantastic so affordable and delicious a great addition to the neighborhood we will be back .
overprice overrated steak dirty tables employees with major attitude you would have to pay me to eat here .
the food is great and the staff is extremely nice i love all the fantastic vegetarian options and the fact that its byob .
downright terrible their bread is the only thing thats worth eating the meat is bland and tough if you end up in this neighborhood for cheesesteak go across the street to pats .
large jerk chicken and rice is 10 bucks out the door the chicken is deliciously spicy and tender the rice has an insane amount of flavor as well i really cant say anything else the people are friendly and the food is great .
got the whiz wit i like the bread and onions at pats better i also like the chopped steak at pats better the guy who took our orders seemed like he was really sick of dealing with tourists .
had lunch there small place essentially counter service i had the goat stew which was good wife had a jamaican beef patty which was great definitely will go back .
seriously wtf the obvious success of genos reminds me of the contemporary hiphop music industry people put out utter crap that any 2bit idiot could yet somehow achieve success the likes of us will never see fml .
one of the best pizza places around great choice for anyone looking for real traditional great pizza taste .
overrated clap clap clapclapclap go to chubbies .
consistent quality a broad selection of italian favorites and good service it is a go to for many who work nearby their salads are particularly good i have to say the pizzas are great as well .
sucked sandwhich wasnt good the service sucked the tables were really dirty and not worth all the hype dont let the bright lights draw you in take a trip to tony lukes if you want the best .
go to piccolos for the pizza not the pasta reasonably priced for the regular or special slices buffalo chicken and their white pies are some of the best choices other choices are alright went there once and the pasta was drenched in oil for the most part .
yum i love my south philly cheesesteak this one is good but i prefer pats i would have given it 3 stars but the staff is so freaking rude and the limited outside table areas are not always kept very clean .
pizza only i always get the margherita slice thin crispy crust fresh mozz tomato topping i miss this pizza dearly apparently byob .
the steak was ok a little tasteless its the philly hype pats is the same its the hype cheese fries were good just a little too filing lil sicilys is the best in philly for a cheese steak .
great spot to bring your own wine with a reasonably priced menu full of standard selections and some great specials a great spot if you live in central jersey and are meeting people from the philly area as its right in between .
this place is a freaking tourist trap its terrible cheesesteaks its competitive wpats as the worst place in philly .
we have gone here numerous times for pizza and finally sat in the dinning room for a dinner we were not disappointed we had the chicken francaise sp and chicken parmesan food was good and liked that is is byob better than most local places will go again .
genos oh you mean the giant bug light and mess at 9th passayunk skip it there are much better cheesesteaks in the city the locals dont go to pats or genos but if your going to go i vote pats .
i dont like pizza if anything i like chicago deep dish but i love their pizza .
better roll than pats but that is where it ends youll find better steaks elsewhere but if youve never been to philadelphia before you have to try a steak at genos then at pats to compare for yourself the fries with whiz at genos are pretty decent .
like the best pizza for me that comes with wide variety .
greasy but ok went there on a business trip because of all the speak english hype at the time its located in what i consider a sketchy part of town but probably ok in south philly standards .
chicken saltimboca was very good service very attentive nice family restaurant .
i dont think ill eat a philly cheese steak ever again it does not look or taste appetizing and my stomach definitely did not agree with it t its not good for breakfast brunch lunch dinner late night or desserts .
we eat here all the time the food is amazing vodka sauce over angel hair pasta is the way to go the fish and chicken dishes are also very good .
hot sauce my a is still burning and i have been banned from the sheraton maid required a hazmat suit to clean the bathroom thanks genos .
best pizza in mercer county hands down dinners are great as well good customer service ive been going for some time to this place never bad service or food .
someone wrote sucks less than pats that sums it up really well consider this item it is at least one hundred times cleaner than pats .
for the little hole in the wall feel this place has it has an amazing beer selection great people very solid food live music what is there not to love .
i came from va with my family just to try those two famouse places n we r so disappointed because taste is really bad nothing special .
loved the look and feel of this place and all the cool history that goes along with it i usually go for the live music and food on the weekends the staff is very friendly and great place to just chill out .
horrible all the hype for nothing just another tourist spot not worth the trip the bread was hard the meat dry and nasty really not worth it at all there are better philly cheesesteaks closer to downtown philly go there instead .
this place was a surprising find we were looking for some place to watch some football while visiting friends they had an pretty impressive beer selection and 5 wings on sundays too bad its not closer to where i live .
joey vento served me my steaks at 6 am these were simply over rated cleaner than pats however neither were delicious i believe this to be a tourist trap .
nice cozy little spot in the middle of bloomfield passed it a million times but it was worth it if you went to bloomfield high you are guaranteed to run into someone here .
this place creeped me out with all their hostile sinage and then the food wasnt even that great if youre in the neighborhood just go across the street to pats .
i come here at least once a week the food is great as well as the service by the way if you like specialty beers they have them all the also have a beer social club where you earn gift cards this is hands down my favorite bar .
too much hype to this place w too little to show for just like the rating meh .
the atmosphere is great the bar is clean and up to date the food is awesome had the quesadillas and their death seat burger was unreal loved the beer battered and deep fried crunchiness a must taste if visiting the place i will be visiting them often .
take a picture there then leave if youre unbelievably famished then order the cheese fries .
great place to eat at and fun place to hang at cooldest tap beer around great staff and friendly bartenders a place to vist to have some fun love this place jp .
steakumm comsteaks htm .
great place for drinks in the evening with friends and dinner with the family in the daytime fast friendly attentive service been back a few times and everything on the menu has been great definately will be going back .
love the lights but i was really expecting more from such heated competition and um when did south philly become the arbiter of proper english .
love the burgers and the serversbartenders good drink specials and shuffleboard go here and bring your friends its a great local bar owned by local guys that deserves a chance .
had the pork sandwich it was awful had better ones in school cafeterias plus the surly attitude of the staff just makes this a no brainer skip it and save your money .
you cant ask for much more in a local bar recently re opened and dusted off the old canal inn has it all the regulars literally haunt the place be careful where you sit ask the bartender where the death seat is .
for all the hype ive heard about this place i expected a whole lot more the steak wasnt bad but just wasnt great i think ive had better cheesesteaks in ny and cali .
came here for brunch last weekend delicious veggie wings with fried brussels sprouts mixed in then i had the toad in a hole which was huge and full of delicious chorizo would highly recommend it and look forward to coming back when the deck is open .
1st place to sell philly cheesesteaks multiple celebrity pictures quick philly service decent fries not good philly cheesesteak .
im updating this because ive recently had infinitely times better service and i found a menu favorite the tempeh reuben i think i was too quick to judge this place before they got settled in i wish the menu had cheaper options because id go back more .
worse than pats big signs controversy long lines bad meat bad rolls annoying policies expensive why go read my pats review if you want something more indepth .
love this place food is great and the service is always good best happy hour in fishtown .
the 2nd best cheesesteak at the intersection which puts it at about 83 overall in the region the meat isnt good the rolls arent good and all the lights and whatnot are just way too overthetop but still ive had worse a tourist trap and nothing more .
good vegan options and the wings tossed in bbq sauce are so so good im happiest here at late night happy hour and brunch time ive really come around on cedar point in the past two years .
my classmates and i tried 5 different cheese steaks places during our cheese steak crawl and genos pats where the worst two they are both too greasy their bread is crap and they give you much less meat than other places e g cosmis .
premium bar 2 kenzingers on mondays get here .
this place sucks meats not marinated bread is soggy tasteless go to the great steak escape at your local shopping mall instead .
fried egg blt is the best cheap good beers never a wait when i go and friendly service .
mierda de perro nada mas .
my neighborhood go to place great food and relaxing atmosphere love the outside deck part and the service is great would love more veggie options though .
i dont think their cheese steaks have enough meat also the bread was too hard too bad this was my first philly cheesesteak after moving here i dont think ill be back again .
nice place great staff and good ownership who is willing to fix any problem i recommend the cobb salad very good and great beer n drink specials and always a change of food specials .
greasy boiled meat of which there was little of in my cheesesteak culturally offensive signs in the windows annoying 2 tier ordering system .
the food and atmosphere at cpbk are great i am a big fan of the wings served with brussel sprouts and the kale burger rocks the outdoor seating is great and the bar is beautiful with creative and delicious cocktails and friendly staff .
awful unchopped and gristly meat with a side of ignorance all soaked in that burning 24hr neon glow .
brunch was delicious bill had red beans and rice with andouille spicy but yummy i had red hash great flavors beets sweet potato and poblanos both dishes with eggs over easy went perfectly with a cider and a moscow mule .
vom it was all grissle and fat i hate this place .
great food and drinks great catfish yall .
out of all the places to get a cheesesteak in this cheesesteak capital i loathe genos the most its gross simple as that even if im drunk and have burned all my taste buds off its still gross .
really nice young place friendly staff good draft menu out of this world crab cake sandwich love their choice to have potatoes instead of fries .
yuck nothing about it was good i get better cheesesteaks in san francisco .
love this place i loved a full plate their past restaurant and now i love this place just as much food is delicious great drinks and great atmosphere i recommend the tempeh ruben and beet raviolis they are delicious great outdoor deck for summer nights too .
im not a big fan my experiences at genos are always disappointing the meat is too tough and fatty but hey if you like eating tough and fatty cheesesteaks under ridiculously bright neon lights then go to genos enjoy .
my idea of heaven is eating cedar points chicken and waffles while soaking up some sun on their awesome outdoor deck the friendly service and yummy bloody marys are added bonuses .
well i couldnt review pats without reviewing genos so to sum things up in a nutshell crap .
greasy but oh so good i had the fried pickles yum and a blt sandwich that had a lot more of a bite then i thought it would delicious but spicy couldnt stop eating it yummy cheap beer too .
genos is inferior to pats for two reasons the first is their meat which appears to be tougher and gristleier than pats the second is their ubertacky sign which makes that corner look like reno which isnt a good thing .
we started with brussels sprouts veggies wings and they were the bomb also we tried some yummy cocktails from here dont remember the name but they worth it friendly staff cute decoration exciting atmosphere would definitely go there for friday night .
id eat at genos but i dont know how to speak english .
awesome restaurant in our neighborhood with creative and delicious menu beer selection rotates and will never leave you thirsty we love brunch here and sitting on the patio outside on a nice day is a great way to meet up with friends in the hood .
the cheese whiz variety was better than the provolone and the condiments station was very nice however i prefer my steaks without evil politics lay off the antispanishspeaking antimumia garbage and let me eat my cheesesteak in peace you psychos .
great menu awesome service even though i only eat at the bar try the cedar point lemonade .
didnt get to try out pats because it was closed but the cheesesteak here wasnt that great we also tried out jims right before so comparably speaking genos was below average .
another solid trip to cedar point the wings with roasted brussels sprouts were great cocktails were also very good .
overrated for too much grease and tude sheesh humm just prefer more veggies somewhere beyond the friedsauteed onions .
been here twice now and the burger and wings are some of the best you can find in the city amazing flavors cant wait to go back .
all i can say about genos is its better pats but i have had some of the worst cheesesteaks i have ever eaten at both of them i just can understand why people make such a big deal about them other than local rivalry .
great beer on tap at a great price had a bunch of small plates and a burger which was very good i even liked the vegan food that we ordered i never thought id love brussel sprouts even my 6 year old ate them .
nice people but food is very sweet we had the pad thai and massaman curry and couldnt stomach either .
awesome place walked by this vacant restaurant for a long time always looked like an awesome deck so happy this place has finally become a great place to eat outside and have a nice drink on a warm summer night .
unless you have hours to spend sitting in a one room house structure dont come here just one waiter and it literally takes an hour for the food to appear the food is good though but i dont think its worth the wait .
we were from out of town and we found this great little place the fried green tomato po boy was the best i ever had definitely a fresh yummy southern food place .
service is slow waitress was sleepy ignored my request for mild spices food arrived way too spicey wake up waitress listen to me when i say mild spice .
excellent beer choices laid back ambience eclectic foodie selection of munchies and helpful wait staff ive been back several times and not been disappointed .
as usual the service is horrible took half hour to get pizzas when the restaurant isnt crowded food ok but only get take out never sitting down in here again .
a solid addition to the fishtown area vegetarians come here their vegetarian selections are innovative and delicious reubens vegan cheese plate veggie croquettes veggie wings they have all of these plus more .
i tried the pizzeria with my colleague today it is way overprice besides the pizza dough tasted like undercooked i will not come back again .
i didnt come here expecting anything a friend promised me wings and a beer on a friday night i walked away from kellianns having eaten one of the best pork tenderloin sandwiches ever im hooked .
i only come here for take out as it is extremely close to my home the food is decent but the staff behind the counter is always rude i stopped coming in after a few times the food is not worth the bad attitude its served with .
great neighborhood spot must try the burger tasty food good service and moderately priced beer strong drinks and nice patrons a little small and a bit divelike but still very nice place during the week .
i was here for a private party luncheon and the food was really bad it was barely edible avoid this place at all costs .
there is a reason this place got only 4 stars the mens room is really small i have a 54 inch waist and i had a hard time turning around other than that i liked the place .
me and my dad saw our friends band perform here its a dive bar nothing special its just not my scene but i do remember ordering food and wut i had was good just cant remember wut it was its been a long time .
hard to park but go around back to do it quite little irish pub they also serve food have a guinne and enjoy .
went there on a saturday at about 700 an order of onion rings took 45 minutes burgers followed at the 1hour mark food was nothing spectacular there were only 4 tables filled in the place so the delay was confusing .
nice dive with good cheap drinks good outside seating in the summer i wouldnt recommend dinner here though .
there is no way that im going to pay 13 for the same burger i paid 9 for 2 years ago the beers have gotten smaller for the price and their liquor menu has been adjusted for cost booo .
great corner bar friendly bartenders and relaxing atmosphere this bar is the quintessential neighborhood corner bar they serve my favorite irish whiskey clontarf which very few irish bars in philly actually have havent had anything but a great time here cant wait to go again .
i tried it again self punishment just sucks .
sat at bar ordered a burger off the specials menu that had long hots the pepper in it it was slammin the fries were really thincrispygreat as well the beer was wet outdoor seating looked cool yeah eatin food .
while i love this place for the closeness to my house and the awesome wings the service sucks there arent enough people working so while the bartender does try their best they just cant handle the amount of people neighborhood dive bar that needs more staff .
im here right now and the music is great the food is great and im loving the blackened shrimp caesar salad my hubby absolutely loves the wings and the bartender waitress is so nice i will definitely come back if i am in the area .
went here had a pint and some wings the wings were average not anything spectacular like the menu would have you believe small place but nice to go watch the game at .
clean atmosphere friendly staff good location and great dogs too many options beg for many visits online ordering helps for take out .
every morning i walk by kellianns and noticed the delivery of bread on a few occasion all of the bread was thrown across the floor i dont step foot in the place anymore the bathrooms are nasty .
mac cheese on a hot dog genius and delicious the bbq bacon dog is awesome too highly recommend this place good food at school price ive only been able to make it down there once so far but i cant wait to go back .
food is not that great service sucks they play favorites with their customers place is better when adela is there when she goes away look out cause when shes not there its a bust .
finally a hot dog made to perfection very friendly staff easy to locate and the hotdogs are amazing all the time made your way and topped to your liking this place is the best .
who the hell decides to fumigate on friday night when there are customers in the restaurant casa adela .
they have the best mac and cheese their hot dogs are amazing my personal favorite is the kielbasa try jordans you will not be disappointed .
they ran out of rice and the food was alright people who give it 5 stars obviously dont know good food the service was horrific and thats an understatement .
stumbled on this place accidentally while ducking into the bakery next door and dude its great the service is friendly and efficient the hot dogs are top notch and the menu is compact but creative come here also i noticed that they deliver for those in town .
overpriced paid 7 for a small chicken salad sandwich that came with nothing but an under brined pickle .
they stayed open for us after hours and the hot dogs were awesome .
dont believe the hype brooklyn staple doubtful food is awful service is worst cleanliness questionable dont eat here .
amazing ive ordered from jordans twice and each time was great food is delivered fast hot and with a smile the georgia hot is classic and yummy the mac supreme is indulgent spicy and filling i also love the deli pickles .
iconic place but they probably have slipped their standards in recent years got served a stone cold omelet for breakfast .
if you dont like this place you are a bad person .
i found this place on yelp with the higest ranking i spent 15 min to reach that place and it was closed waste .
great little hot dog joint family owned and run nice people support small businesses .
we had to wait in line for like half an hour and then when we go inside it was just mediocre diner food wtf there are mediocre diners everywhere just go to one of those if you want that kind of food .
on 11262014 ordered takeout 2 chicken mofongos and 8 pasteles the price 45 00 cash they do not accept credit or debit the food was delicious flavorful fresh .
people said this place was good for pancakes its not belowaverage spongy greasyspoon diner kind of things that get tough after four minutes on the table really not good .
one con cash only other than that all the food was amazing just like my grandma makes it we had the mufungo pernil beef stew arroz con gandolez plus chicken soup its amazing amazing amazing omg omg i would go there every day for every meal .
sorry to say i was pretty disappointed service was rushed all 3 of our orders arrived with mistakes cheese in an omelet that wasnt requested sausage instead of bacon sauce not on the side tiny table for 3 people pancakes were tasty but the rest meh .
good cheap puerto rican food ive had lunch here a few times since its right by my office theres a bit of wait for your food but everything comes fresh and piping hot .
forgettable they served better food to me while i was waiting in line than when i actually ordered i dont understand all the hype i know its an old institution but they need to step their game up .
the best puertorican food ive ever had i wish california had a decent ace like this if we come back to visit ny we will definitely come back here .
sorry do not understand the hype the coffee tasted like bile the lemon ricotta pancakes tasted like regular pancakes with pledge mixed in i love good ole greasy spoon diner food as much as the next person but this was a letdown .
so far i only ordered delivery but their rotisserie chicken is mind blowing it comes with delicious rice and beans perfectly delivered i was keep ordering from señor pollo before but casa adelas seasoning made me switch to them highly recommended .
its aight typical diner food the cherry drink is good .
had flan and a cafecito delicious creamy tasty just the right amount of everything will def come back to check out their meals jani says 5 stars for the ensalada de pulpo .
we read the reviews and we thought this would be a great place for breakfast my bf got the cranberry pancakes very thick almost undercooked in the center lots of food i got a burger with fries and it was ok nothing to write home about .
the tostones were amazing the rotisserie chicken was flavorful pork was cooked perfectly service was quick and the cafe con leche was to die for .
i honestly hate this place and hate that it gets such raving reviews there are sooo many better places to have breakfast and lunch in bk now if youre into the whole diner scene then this place works out perfectly for you .
loved the mofongo pernil and sancocho amazingly kind staff great value great place to cure a hangover or a longing for a homecooked meal .
maybe im a food snob but after clinton streets pancakes toms pancakes were not delicious like so many of you claimed i dont know i guess i expected better .
they get 4 stars for food but 1 star for phone etiquette and orderingdelivery attempts via phone .
in a word overrated .
i had the mofongo which was really good in other restaurants it is sometimes dry but here it was pretty moist and they also give you a side of garlic butter sauce also the staff were all very friendly .
one word overrated .
amazing chicken everything tastes like it was slow cooked in my abuelas kitchen so happy to still find some authentic puerto rican flavors in les gentrification hasnt managed to destroy everything .
was very underwhelmed with this place as popular as it seemed to be with the line out the door and all the food was nothing worth putting any time into writing about so in short unless you are severely lacking in options i wouldnt be bothered .
very enjoyable dinner in a comfortable setting the sancocho was delicious my wife loved how they prepared the yuca salad was nothing special platanos were great .
huge disappointment pancake was like lead coffee bland line ridiculously long theyre not handing out gold people i could name three other diners that are better off the top of my head .
best puerto rican food in the city .
alright place pumpkin pancakes too tangy homefries better than most diners dont understand the long lines the free oranges coffee while waiting on line were a nice touch .
the food here is like eating at your grandmothers kitchen counter authentic generous and jam packed with love and flavor the mofongo is especially excellent with the chicharrones also the byob option is excellent thanks for an amazing meal .
eh whatever nice decor indifferent service .
this place is the shiiiiiiiit been coming here for a few years best meal in the neighborhood for under 20 bucks hands down .
yuck .
this is a real puerto rican family resturante and with the best food made by adela for more than 30 years in loisaida amazing .
i went for lunch i got the taco special it was 3 tacos the tacos i make at home are better i dont know if i will go back to try anything else cause lets face it if you cant do a good taco need i say more .
mofongo just mofongo the pollo the everything everything is delicious i love that i feel like im walking into a puerto rican kitchen and you have aunties in the back cooking for you its a hole in the wall and i love that good food good prices .
papa rellena hot on outside cold on the inside coffee watery guava pastry stale croqueta mushy service hospitable but sorry will not be back .
like being in the island love adela whoever she is .
food is very mediocre empanadas were soggy and the black beans and ropa vieja werent impressive .
had them cater my sons birthday party amazing rotisserie chicken and superb pernil reasonably priced super friendly staff .
why come here when there are so many other dinner spots that offer better food service and atmosphere tonight was my last attempt to enjoy a place that lacks in every category .
two words 1 phenomenal 2 mafongo cant wait to go back sweetest people .
nice spot for a drink but very disappointing kitchen the strip steak mussels caesar salad and flat bread were all disappointing .
superb authentic mofongo reasonable prices the location is a pain in the rear but worth it .
knock knock whos there rude ass bartender rude ass bartender who the prissy one with the plucked eyebrows .
best puertorican restaurant authentic puertorican dishes and fresh made small but confy staff and music makes you feel like you in puerto rico .
this place has a nice bar the food is terrible greasy poorly prepared without thought tasteless food awesome bar staff drink here and skip dining .
very cheap very delicious authentic and friendly i am not sure what else you need if you like food from this region of the world then you will like casa adela for a more detailed review read the review directly below this one couldnt agree with it more .
lets be honest the people who like this place are townies loyal to woody you get better tasting food from a tv dinner and the service esp at the bar is queeny and not in a funny or entertaining way and slow pathetically slow even for philly standards .
super authentic and good i can imagine this is how it feels to be in pr at some local joint .
the 2 stars are strictly for the food the service is horrible i wont be going back .
i could eat an entire meal of just the yellow rice and red beans rotisserie chicken and steak with onions are both excellent .
i went to get feood to go and i waited about 15 minutes and left because these waitresses have no manner they ignored me and kept walking by me a hundred times and none of them took my order and i was the only one waiting terrible service .
good food but not great the portions are large which is good and the food is great i had the yellow rice with chicken and beans all was good and i would definitely go back if in the area .
very disappointing dont waste your time the pernil is dry and tasteless buffet style food that is just not good the neighborhood is not the best neighborhood either you can definitely wind up down the wrong block if you dont know the area .
good authentic down home puerto rican good hiding out in alphabet city service is so friendly to spanish and englishspeakers alike .
expected it to be better with all the hype executing a good hot dog shouldnt be difficult but in the end what made it lack luster was a poor choice of bun the bread just aint good tryharderphilly .
havent been here for at least six months but if its still like it was then im heading back roast chicken and rice and sweet plantains and black beans and awesome .
what happened to standards bun was ice cold not a chicago dog in my book and so filthy as in a dump this used to be my favorite dog joint in philly but like jims has lost its standards such a shame .
amazing authentic perfectly made anyone who says anything different doesnt know puerto rican food super cheap too .
i was intoxicated when i ate here yet still found it nasty the bread needs to be warmed up more and doesnt taste fresh i guess theyre pretty creative with the different dogs but quality was horrible .
just tried casa adela and left with a full tummy and a huge smile i dont eat meat but had no problem having a terrific feast here black beans yellow rice sweet plantains bring your pork loving friends and chow down .
meh overpriced hotdogs in a basement focus on making a good hot dog not these fancy named silly ones also this is a garden levelbasement setting thus it lacked ambience .
the cuban sandwich is awesome and a side of rice and beans will definitely feed more than one person i like coming here because i always have lunch for the next day too .
meh underwhelming and they charged me 1 50 for a cup of water wont be back .
delicious my mom discovered this place off of the food network i think it was tiny homey almost kind of out of the way but definitely worth the trek the staff was really nice as well .
food was all around ehh save yourself the disappointment and find a better place to eat .
absolutely wonderful roast chicken theres not much else to say .
waiter took so long that gave me time to really analyze menu and realize how pricey dishes were based on ingredients food bazaar buy 6 plantains for 2 waited more walked out .
whole rotisserie chicken 8 50 yellow rice 4 50 wellpriced delicious manhattanbased pollo rico y aros priceless .
had lunch there today food was not good at all and spent 80 00 should have just thrown out car window calamari was over cooked ox tail was not right meat tasted off good luck but i told u all .
this is alphabet city at its puerto rican best i can imagine this is what good pr home cooking is like chicken off the rotisserie is delicious stews are rich and flavorful flan is amazing almost like a cheese cake plus the staff is super nice .
food is okay but very pricy for the quality appetizer for 15 bucks and entree for 18 at minimum .
what an amazing puerto rican restaurant being from puerto rico myself i miss the food terribly but every time i come here i leave as satisfied as if i ate at my grandmas kitchen and the best part of all is that its super affordable and byob .
mediocre food .
totally solid its pretty amazing what you can get for under 10 here so cheap and the 12 pollo is really good ill definitely be visiting this place again on a side note its byob if you dine in .
ok food expensive for what it is slow and crappy service if you want to try cuban cuisine this place will do but not really a place you would return multiple times .
wepa homemade puerto rican food como mi mami authentic cheap delicious forget ambiance or detailed service youre here for the food and the flan everything on the menu is always spot on so just order whatever youre in the mood for terrific tiny spot .
yikes this place is unbelievably greasy maybe im used to better cuban food but there was oil literally dripping from our dishes as we left and walked around the side we could see into the kitchen we havent been back since .
my husband loves adelas coffee beautiful pictures you can feel the history of the place very nice staff the food smell great cheap .
horrendous service absolutely horrendous the food has also gone downhill i used to rave about this place after three occasions in a row with terrible service and mediocre food i will not return .
love the cuban sandwich with its fresh pork thats prepared daily smothered in melting cheesy goodness and finished with plentiful ham and theres pickles and mustard and its 4 cheaper than porchetta competition is good for the market right .
our food was horrible qdoba taste better than this i enjoy qdoba but we all know its not authentic .
all i can say is that it really feels like home to me reminds me of my summers in the carribean the coffee is absolutley great the pictures on the wall are also captivating and tell a rich story about les .
very small place great food but when you have a restaurant this small owner cant be so eccentric that they throw a birthday party for themselves that practically closes the place down during dinner hour wtf was this owner thinking .
amazing service and food pricey but its well worth it great ambiance but the service just awesome .
literally smelled like urine giving it two stars instead of one because we didnt actually taste any food before leaving so who knows .
some of the most skilled bartenders in the city work here the wine selection is killer and the menu is great .
omg 1pm on a friday and they ran out of brisket we came here just for this what are you going to tell the dinner people also you cant get corn bread or beef ribs at lunchtime i guess this is a part time restaurant .
this place was fantastic the drinks the food and what i really loved was the upscale contemporary atmosphere expensive but worth the price for a stylish night out .
despite the food being pretty good the service and management does not have it together and they are not ready to be open yet .
this place was fantastic the drinks the food and what i really loved was the upscale contemporary atmosphere expensive but worth the price for a stylish night out .
so much potential with a great layout unfortunately upkeep is horrendous greens and fairways need to be cut down payed 48 on a sunday afternoon and walked out without finishing 18 because my husband and i were so frustrated with the course .
ocean prime made my bosss birthday the most memorable ever wondering what took them so long to open for lunch .
terrible pizza often cold on delivery and rather bland its marginally better when dining in say what you will about supporting local businesses but if there were a dominos in the area this wouldnt survive .
had the fillet mignon and the blueberry cheesecake steak was so tender and cooked perfectly delicious the cheesecake was smooth and amazing .
walked in looked around saw the all you can eat heat lamp heated pizza and salad bar with crusted over beans took a peak in the kitchen and walked the heck out .
i thought the food and atmosphere was awesome the food was fantastic and the service was too i would highly recommend .
they take way too long with delivery the food was okay and was not super hot etc .
amazing mac and cheese and the pasta as good too the place itself has a great ambiance and ritzy type feel as expected .
theyve changed their chef to someone who doesnt believe in pizza sauce on pizzas so now its not even good as take out .
sooooo delicious the lobster mac cheese is the best maccheese i have had in my life excellent service very upscale place everything i had was divine .
we had the place cater to us we had them deliver our meals to the hotel and there was nothing special about eba the food was alright when we ordered they did give us all the essentials that we needed .
the service and food where outstanding from the calamari to the chocolate cake also the bubbling berries drink was good and exciting to see it bubble .
terrible food terrible service dirty floors sat me at a table with crumbs on it get real or get out of the business .
we have been three times and each time the food and service were excellent the sides are served family style and each one was great love it there and would highly recommend the restaurant is very pretty inside with a really nice bar cant wait to return .
food was mediocre yea but being able to order food online as youre walking back to the river from sudikoff was a niiiiice option who else knows where the river dorms are .
i came here for center city sips on a whim and im glad i did this is one of the classiest restaurants ive been to in center city and the atmosphere is nothing short of alluring for an anniversary or other celebration i would highly recommend ocean prime .
really bad food all around their buffet looked like they were all leftovers pizza is definitely not up to par with any restaurants even the chains .
theatrical drinks theatrical drinks need i say more gorgeous place the decor and ambiance reminiscent del friscos but this is my new favorite spot .
bread sticks miniature loaves of bread with square pieces of what appeared to be american cheese melted on top marinara tasted more like ketchup eww .
excellent service by drew excellent food and beautiful atmosphere perfect for a night out or a special occasion .
dont bother the food is gross .
i really enjoyed it here great food great service and great ambiance it is a bit loud when crowded but what do you expect i will definitely be back .
only as a last resort no offense e b a s but lets face it youve been around long enough to figure out how to make better pizza .
very good service and great food the staff is good and dont rush you out the door i would recommend to anyone .
waited 40min for food no interest in coming back asked for what happen said there busy .
excellent food great service atmosphere is beautiful management ensures great service from the second you arrive one of phillas best .
yuk noise level was very high food was very mediocre most significantly the chair was so uncomfortable i will have to go to a chiropractor to get my back straightened out making my dinner there one of the costliest ive had since moving here .
food was fantastic serive was fantastic the ambience was fantastic a very nice dining experience indeed .
i asked for a cappucino with whole milk it definitely wasnt that the club sandwich was cold i wont be back .
omg best service best food and just seriously everything to the best there is d even fixed a none alcoholic beer for this poor foreign boy d honestly best night of my vacation so far a its a shame not to have gone here .
arrogance stressed staff and an aura of we are too busy to serve you attitude awaits if snobby attitudes are what you are looking for this is definitely the place .
great happy hour great selection of 4 00 bottled beers 7 00 wines and mixed drink specials the calamari is killer at 7 00 as well beautiful inside and friendly staff this is my new go to place .
too much flash not enough substance that was the worst pad thai in a 20mile radius youre lucky i was hungry .
sit at the bar popcorn unbelievable drinks amazing bartenders friendly and the food salad scallops steak all delicious i highly recommend it and i cant wait to go back .
went here for business lunch this place is gimmick and trying to be trendy not worth it .
love this place it is classy without the fake posh and circumstance fun atmosphere food was awesome drinks were exceptional service was first class this is our new favorite place .
my wife was more excited about their couples seats that hang from the ceiling on the second floor than their food the food was just ok .
another fantastic lunch this is a must stop by local italian restaurant you cant pass up plenty of space where you dont feel crowded and can have an intimate lunch or dinner .
i really love the atmosphere and ambiance the food was delicious however i did not like the hostess at all not very upbeat but maybe caught them on a bad day will try again .
great great great bring your favorite wine and have a great meal lunch or dinner .
great ambiance but the bartender was pretty much useless if you wanted anything not on her menu of six classics how can you work in a bar that specializes in classic cocktails and not know how to make a sazerac .
i used to go here all of the time because i was a sales rep great food great service great people i loved the specials they offered esp the spinach quiches so yummy hope to go back soon .
on a sat too crowded the roof deck is the size of my bathroom .
still the best fast food chicken around the sides are pretty good too location was clean and tidy service was a bit lackluster overall a decent meal for 6 .
noisy noisy noisy and the food was just eh i did not like the lobster orzo and cheese they should stick to the original just an opinon i dont think id ever go back and wouldnt recommend .
great fried chicken as you would expect from any popeyes spicy lightly battered tender and moist it hits the spot every time i knocked it down a star only because they tend to be busy and the service seems slow .
if youre from out of town come here if youre from philly dont be seen here ever .
i always forget that this place exists but they have one really great pizza ordered a large pepperoni for pickup i recommend .
drinks upstairs is nice esp when its nice out from the outside it doesnt look like a famous restaurant or anything fancy i thought it was a diner but the food is decent but the drinks are pretty bad and overpriced its an interesting decor though .
delish pizza from a rude old man prices are great ignore the grouch and take your pizza to go .
great food nice atmosphere horrible service .
this place is awesome a large pepperoni pie for 11 seriously you cant find that anywhere and the pizza is good much better than any other place ive tried in bayonne .
i dont recommend you bother over priced drinks terrible think food poisoning bad food on the upside the decor is amazing and the staff are great .
the slices are thin and delicious im partial to the plain but when i feel like getting crazy i may get a white or a chicken francaise order some garlic knots 51 go for broke .
great roof bar but like a lot like the other steven starr restaurants there is little love in the food you pay for the theme .
the brunch here is amazing the omelets with spinach or mushrooms came with amazing french fries the pancakes and the omelets are a must the only problem is only cash but there is an atm at the door the service is nice and fast .
youre serving my grey goose martini in an acrylic glass and charging me 20 for the privilege of being at your rooftop bar please think again continental .
toms is the go to place when you want to have a great huge breakfast toms specializes in all things breakfast but my slant has always been towards their fresh fruit pancakes delicious bacon and perfect java .
crowded strange scene and the food was very subpar i left quite confused with no possible reason to ever wish to return .
delivery is off every time but the quality of the food in the restaurant is great best pancakes i have ever had besides mine of course are the lemon ricotta pancakes and the banana walnut ones too so yummy .
not a fan weird scene upside is the roof deck food sucks service blows crowd is lame .
always solid and efficient service its very much a diner not a fancy place just good food made and run by good people .
food is delicious i enjoy eating here but unfortunately they are a stickler about when they close we wanted to order another bottle of wine and were told that unless we can finish it in 15 min we probably shouldnt get it what restaurant turns away making money .
everything is good especially the sweet potato pancakes with homemade flavored butter along with turkey bacon and scrambled eggs dont forget the hot chocolate with whipped cream oh the portion sizes are plenty so bring a big appetite .
the food is always excellent but they never never honor their reservation time last night we waited 50 minutes beyond our confirmed reservation .
crab cakes florentine with spicy sauce and french fires as your side chocolate pancakes blow your mind everything is amazing .
caution my jacket was stolen right off the coat rack while i was eating at the common table mgmt could have cared less .
lemon ricotta pancakes were to die for had so much food friendly staff pretty gooooooodd .
went there with a group of 6 on a saturday night had to wait for 1 5 hours for a table so we grabbed a few drinks next door service was great but the food overall was average i got the lamb chops have had better before .
very good cheeseburger fries are great and i like the place .
food was ok and serviced was rushed as they overbooked i heard the waitress tell the table next to me that they had to be out by 930pm for their next reservation they didnt even order yet lol .
sorry to hear of gus passing i love this place i love being greeted in such a nice and comforting way me and my boyfriend made this place our official go to place for breakfast each year on our bday .
very average food there are better greeks that this i ordered the pistachio lavraki very plain dindnt like it the 3 dips hated it but the bread was good and shrimp pasta was ok wouldnt come back but the place was nice but too loud .
toms gets packed like no ones business something about the pancakes the brunch here is cheap avoid the scrambled eggs they over fry them the lines are long but the waiters are friendly toms an institution of brunchery .
i have been in nyc for 6 days and this was the only meal that i found unsatisfactory the fish was fishy and had bones and the wait people were pretentious the portions were tiny and mediocre yuk .
come early or you will be waiting in a line that reaches to the outside for breakfast my food was fresh and delish i am not really a fan of diners but i enjoyed my experience here .
its fine only one vegetarian option which wasnt that great im sure the wine was good ill go back for wine only not dinner the decor is pretty sexy though .
they have homemade butter to go with their pancakes strawberry pumpkin cinnamon the cinnamon one was amazing over the pancakes it remind me of roscoe chicken waffle .
last minute stop bagels were ok nothing spectacular service was friendly prices average .
always loved this place the decor is filled with memorabilia from past to present the crab cake florentine is to die for i always have a great experience when im here .
rude cashiers when they messed up my order and went back to get it fixed they got it wrong for the second time this time one of the cashiers gave me an attitude insinuating that i must have given the wrong instructions .
i love the pancakes but i hate the wait ppl are nice and its a good place to go with family members .
the workers are so rude they even charged me for plastic plates they take forever to bring out the food that only tastes mediocre for its price .
the pancakes their selection is absolutely amazing all the food arrives promptly and youre seated relatively quickly the only downside is that it is cash only its also extremely noisy but thats due to the young customer crowd and is no fault of the restaurant .
food is usually good service sucks waited in restaurant at table for a half hour for cheese pizza and was told they lost the ticket but would start then we left .
the food is amazing on point cool resturant and spot for breakfast lunch and dinner yummy .
第一次来费城，看到评价很高就来了，结果。。。。发自内心的说一句，特别特别不适合中国人的口味，千万别来­吃啊！！！！面包硬的挑战你的口腔，各种奇怪的意式酱真的。。。总之，同行的朋友都没怎么吃！不过估计外国­人特别享受吧，他们应该很喜欢！ .
oh yes my kind of place we got in an sat down right away they service breakfast all day ive had grits and eggs and cornbeef .
i just got swindled no indication if they were open tonight and got charged for an order thinking about filing a police report for fraud stay away .
easily the best diner ive ever been to absolutely delicious fries are magical we had crab cakes florentine and blue cheese burger unbelievably good .
this place has awful service we couldnt get seated for 15 minutes so we left what a waste .
had the cinnamon pancakes with bacon very very good food not the best but very fulfilling the butters are amazing .
bizarre eccentric menu and slowasmolasses service adds up to a subpar dining experience at this gowanus eatery pick jowl or pigeon or pigs feetthe choice is yours either way the wait will be yours too not worth it .
excellent place i go every weekend with my girlfriend for brunch the quality and amount of food is unbelievable and the waiters are really nice .
never consistent except for the pigeon wings how cheap can u be go anywhere else .
the pancakes are really good especially the lemon zest one they are fluffy and exactly right the egg benedict however was a let down due to low quality of the ham i would recommend this place any time .
try the milano panini roast pork broccoli rabe tasted below average and the bowtie pasta salad is too greasy two stars for the food just order takeout cannot comment about the service .
love the food environment and staff i definitely enjoyed the service i would love it if the venue was larger but that adds to the ambience doesnt accept credit cards .
its like a jersey shore episode in this place weak food over priced and just plain sleazy zucchini cakes were meh and the lamb was over cooked felt like a scene and not a place to get good food why does this place have such a high rating .
i think the hype is kind of undeserved but my friend did most of the heavy lifting waiting and my mexican omelet tasted good enough still for a somewhat better than average greasy spoon the votives on yelp seem misplaced .
average food high prices incompetent service .
this is a little gem of a diner near prospect park quite busy but we quickly got a table i had the pancakes pure heaven accompanied by all those delicious flavored butters it was a nice touch .
wasnt that big of a selection for dinner its either ribs or pork and thats it food was ok but i personally wouldnt be running back anytime soon the place itself was nice but just really not that much on the menu to choose from .
who else serves you cups of coffee and gingers snaps while youre waiting in line on the weekends nobody thats who 15 years of happy meals with friends at toms and counting dont change .
small portions and overrated id rather get something in chinatown .
delicious food quick service the line was out the door but we were in in less than 10 minutes great breakfast .
this place is ridiculous it is the worst filipino food i ever tasted small plates not worth it overpriced for no reason not authentic filipino food seriously need to reevaluate their menu the only good thing about the place is the music .
supreme pancakes i will never look at ihop the same .
not sure what all the hoopla is about had the sisig signature dish and a few others very greasy waiters looked like lost kids who accidentally wandered into a restaurant cute decor though .
nice neighborhood breakfast cafe fabulous pancakes i had the sweet potato pancakes and they were delightful its tucked away in prospect park area and was pretty busy during the weekday i imagine weekends are horribly busy for this neighborhood gem .
the staff made me feel stupid and unhip enough for their restaurant waiter said he just moved to town i grew up around the corner .
loved the ambience wonderful veggie breakfast highly recommend the home made fries .
planetprinceton com2014… .
the line can be quite long the place was packed but it was worth it today was my first time here but i will definitely be back the staff was very friendly and the food was great i am so glad this was my breakfast choice .
mediocre if you like that sort if thing dont expect to be blown off your feet here just a more expensive applebees good place to bring kids for a quick easy meal .
loved it came over from london for just this kind of experience real american diner with a proper breakfast just dont have a milkshake at seven thirty in the morning felt pretty ill portions are huge thoroughly recommended also very baby friendly .
amazing ambiance and history with so much potential however this bar and restaurant continue to disappoint in food and terribly poor service its great for one drink but thats about it .
this is my first time in ny this place is awesome great prices for a homemade meal its worth waiting in the long linethey pass out free pancakes and whipped cream strawberries .
had two dinners here one at the bar peppered salmon good good beer good bartender one outside food was lousy waitress wasnt very attentive .
food good service good atmosphere great price good overall i enjoyed it everyone is new york nice food came quick you will definitely wait during peak hours but they do bring you food coffee etc .
ambiance is great food was poor at best service was just ok .
went again last friday with my hubby i had the fried chicken cutlet with scramble eggs and french fries toms does not play around the cutlet was the size of the plate the food was delicious .
did not like the service took a very long time to get our order taken after 25 minutes had to flag somebody down and once the food came some of the ingredients promised on the menu were missing from the food will not be back .
the only place i ever want to go to breakfast ever again in my neighborhood best pancakes in the free world .
2 5 stars sure its probably a nice spot for a meal earlier into the evening however friday or saturday night is an entirely different story especially on thanksgiving weekend too many people too few bartenders too much broken glass and spilled booze on the floor .
the waiters are so nice even though i feel like one of them hit on me in front of my boyfriend its clean and quite and the food is amazing the hot chocolate was so yummy will go back again .
the food is ok and pricey they use to be better on quality most of all seafood if frozen they do have good coffee .
its a breakfast diner you wait for a table and eat breakfast not anything crazy unique just simple delicious breakfast always a safe bet perfect for those mornings where you just want to eat and not think about where to get some fancy brunch .
we went last night greater not friendly had reservation tried to sit us at bar area very noisy most food ok ravioli light it was in canned sauce never refilled water would not go back again much better restaurantts .
there was a line out the door but worth the wait good food and friendly service we were served coffee while waiting outside and cookies with whipped cream it was a nice extra we will definitely go back .
food was delicious .
most home grown place ever everyone is so sweet and they give you treats while waiting in line i have never not stood in line for brunch at this place totally worth it the food is great and priced very reasonably .
cheese in dishes was served cold instead of room temperature soup was watery waitress was rude excellent bread it is a pretty place but the prices are too high even for manhattan desserts look lovely .
delicious and well priced ate the belgian waffle home fries eggs service was excellent only complaint is how small the restaurant is but the line to be seated moved quickly definately a place to check out i plan to eat here again .
worst viennese restaurant in the world soggy wiener schnitzel batter fried in oil tasting of fish meat if it was veal not pounded thin sachertorte insults hotel sacher mixed salad insipid coffee like dishwater .
first time in my life im giving 5 stars to anything that isnt my boyfriend whos tom anyways is he hot .
overpriced mediocre food with a decor thats nowhere near nice enough to make up for it .
what a cool oldschool diner line was out the door but servers brought out little treats to keep us happy while we waited definitely worth the wait but make sure you save enough room for what you order the portions are pretty big .
the room is beautiful the food is mediocre the portions are small the prices are large the upper east side formula for the ladies who lunch cant they at least get some real sausages not some typical pumped full of chemicals supermarket brand .
delicious food fast and friendly service old school feel of brooklyn you have to squeeze yourself in the bench minimal sitting space great place for breakfast .
too foo foo and too expenive for my taste great for chicks to hang out and have coffee not good for kids or groups just small tables sorry sabarsky the food was good it is close to the park .
simply the best egg creamawesome and creamy pancakesfluffy and sweet baconcrisp and salty perfection .
overpriced tryingtoohard food and extremely slow service this is the kind of place you take your grandparentsparents or a penn professor to because you know whos footing the bill .
fantastic service in a casual positive environment ricotta pancakes reuben and meatloaf with egg white were all delicious overrated cherrylime ricky and limited parking in the area .
the foodoverpriced and barely edible easily the worst burger i ever had the words pink slime come to mind when describing the quality of the beef .
good food good customer service and the breakfast is amazing i love to get scramble eggs with bacon home fries and a nice bowl of hot grits next time i dine here ill try another dish this diner is definitely worth coming to and the prices are decent .
10 or was it 20 years back it was one of my favorite restaurant i have not gone back for last five years as the experience was not pleasant tried again just feels dated pricey and food is very ordinary not going again .
what else is there to say opened in 1936 theres a reason it hasnt closed service was surprisingly amazing better than ive had in some of the nicest restaurants in nyc food is exactly what you would expect and priced accordingly definitely recommend .
not sure what all the fuss is about .
danish pancakes still thinking about those danish pancakes their beef sausage is very good too and they make their own flavored butter incredible .
after white dog changed owners i felt the food quality had stayed the same and that the presentation had improved but as time went by i had more and more mediocre to negative experiences there now i only go if someone i know wants to go .
good belgian waffle hot chocolate well balanced not too sweet good atmosphere and well hidden overall good breakfast .
its about location not food stick to the bar menu .
line when we got there but it went fast and they give out samples of food while youre waiting love it service was fantastic and prices were very reasonable dishes are big and can easily be split between two people food was amazing loved it .
i had the lunch special it was some type of chicken salad and cream of asparagus soup honestly the chicken salad was the worst attempt at hiding yesterdays left overs the soup was decent overall a lackluster experience not worth the high price .
great little diner with a great wait staff i asked about their egg cream and next thing i know the waiter brings one over for me to try the eggs benedict were also fantastic .
food and atmosphere was great way back when now its just a shell of what it once was sunrise sunset we have no bananas today .
delicious brunch spot amazing selection of pancakes and delicious savory options get there early to avoid the inevitably long lines however .
cool atmosphere but the food was mediocre .
our daughter brought us here for sunday breakfast and let me tell you the food is unexplainably good the pancake dont need any syrup and the corn beef and hash are the bomb if your in brooklyn its worth the visit and the wait .
i want to love it but i just cant the bartender is just lousy and miserable the pub food is ok and the main restaurant has gone down hill buy the cookbook and make the original dishes yourself .
i love this old fashion place i enjoy the good and the customer service the food is great and the menu is out of the world i love the crab cakes .
i respect white dog for what it stands for but the food frankly overrated the space too crowded the service not so great .
best breakfast in brooklyn .
stay away from the veggie sandwich i just think for a town that is so veggie friendly they could do a better job and make at least one decent veggie everything else is good and the creemees are to die for .
love this place so good to their customers there was a long line and they brought us fries and sausage while we were waiting i always get the eggs benedict but i know the pancakes are to die .
this place isnt very good like most pizza in hartford it tasted cheap doughy and soft not much sauce or cheese its like public schools pizza .
amazing food amazing services will definitely return .
what a joke service is rude and deceitful though your choices in the area may be few you can do far better seriously go to burger king youll be much happier in life and thats really sad .
toms restaurant established in 1936 about a mile from my birth place i love this place for its civility and food if toms doesnt have it youre not hungary where else can you get a lollipop when you leave one of brooklyns best .
i dont know what happened but clearly new owners or a new chef must have come along because the food is just so mediocre now its truly disappointing .
the egg benedict tasted amazing and the sauce was good too however it would be better if they use the canadian bacon instead of regular ham the french toast tasted alright but the two pieces of ham was not worth it other than that it was delicious .
i dont know what is going on with this place just ordered the keema paratha and it smells like rotten meat .
food was awesome quite small for such a busy place .
if youre looking for great authentic indian food here is where youll find it .
best banana walnut pancakes ever no hyperbole .
worst customer service ever do not order from them they are inept they delivered my food to some random person without even asking i had to call grubhub twice to rectify the situation absolute disaster and terrible customer service will never order from them again .
great dinner great price great service the moussaka was amazing the portion was perfect and it came with a side salad the service was unexpectedly friendly for new york .
i really like the food but i would appreciate it if you could put a fan that way doesnt small a humid inside .
amazing 100 worth the wait pancakes are delicious .
folks are not friendly here the portions are big but the food is below basic at least they serve la colombe .
the food was ok but it was too crampedcrowded for me .
ordered on a friday night for delivery took one hour and twenty minutes the delivery person nor the store apologized surprised had ordered multiple pizzas in advance and it was fine very disappointing for this delivery .
cant think of one negative thing to say abut this place you just feel warm and tingly inside every time you walk in and if there is ever a wait they will pass out cookies this is a place everyone should go to at least once .
consistently rude were amazingly helpful on a lastminute catering order though so they get 2 stars even then though not a friendly experience at all .
the fries are very crispy w spicy chipotle sauce crab cake florentine was tasty w extra holidaise sauce food is very comforting breakfast is great good servings .
bleh too expensive 3 90 for a pasta slice and did not taste its price probably not going to go there again .
service is friendly and fast good peoplewatching good wallpics creative breakfast options delicious speciality butters served with pancakes pumpkin cinnamon and strawberry nice overeasies good salty sausage and good prices .
overpriced this place serves 3 food for 8 stay away if you have other options .
while the wait can be long on sunday for brunch the food and excellent service more than make up for the wait i highly recommend the pancakes and homemade flavored butter .
i was a stromboli virgin until today i want my vcard back .
best brunch spot around be prepared to wait if you go on peak hangover recovery time as the place gets super crowded once you get in you will see why they love it go here its worth it .
just ok the desserts tasted a little overprocessed i had a pastrami sandwich and boneless buffalo wings and bread pudding the wings didnt have enough heat the bread pudding was basically oily soggy bread .
maybe the best pancakes in brooklyn and certainly the best budder spread around as good as breakfast gets .
good food good wine dmv quality service .
a brooklyn institution the last 70 years popular for a reason everthing ive ever had here is delicious sweet potato pancakes banana walnut pancakes real maple syrup and a range of delicious homemade butters my mouth is literally watering writing this review mmmmm so good go eat there .
very bad place to go owner isnt polite with customer .
eggs benedict is my favorite the food and service is great just expect to be a little uncomfortable in the small chairs but its all worth it the food makes up for it .
we enjoyed dinner but we bought a cake from the outside and they are charging us 20 to just cut the cake i have never heard such a rude thing not cool pio pio management .
best pancakes ever try the lemon ricotta pancakes you wont be sorry .
price is double of what is advertised here the staff or owner is not apologetic about it either its a kind of service that makes you question the entire approach of this restaurant i wont recommend it .
cookies while you wait on line egg cream dessert and more faux flowers per square inch only add to toms multiple flavor pancake appeal debate the suzanne vega reference over eggs or waffles but enjoy brooklyn s best diner at the orginal washington avenue location bklynmike com20130128… .
worst staff in the front desk clearly wont last long unless they start caring for customers more .
i couldnt go a whole week without another toms fix despite rain and a 45 minute wait toms still exceeded expectations while waiting we received coffee orange slices turkey ham delicious and vinegar french fries with chipotle horseradish sauce were decided to become regulars .
food is not that great service isnt too great either seems like they rush you out when they have people waiting had better peruvian food .
the worlds best pancakes 15 varieties an old school diner circa 1936 great food 3 kinds of butter and great vinegar fries if youre in the prospect park area definitely a place to check out a hidden gem .
the food was good but only give little amount for a high price the service is just horrible they make you wait even when you ask for the same like three times and still nothing not coming back .
amazing breakfast you have to try it atleast once very classy old school diner need to go for the pancakes they have every kind of butter very quick and good service .
unbelievably loud .
large menu and portions no reservations or alcohol good times and food .
food was pretty good but together with the horrible service not at all worth the price .
not too much more to add other than the fact that they give you coffee and snacks in line makes the wait immensely more enjoyable .
went with a group of 17 people for lunch service was horrible took over 90 minutes for meal drinks were not filled very much when the food eventually came it was good the bad service over clouded the food .
that is right new york style diner they serve best in the area pancakes nice one for breakfast so if you are fan of american food this is right place .
the chicken was soooo dry it was like powder in our mouth do not order the cold potato dish either .
love love love having breakfast here .
food is fabulous but the hosts and the waiters are horrid definitely needs more professionalism for such a known restaurant does not live up to expectation .
decent coffee pancakes i want to sleep inside of wake up to eat my way out perfect homefries fast service the place still stands with charm you can tell its been around for years serving delicious fairpriced breakfast to earlymorning neighborhood workers and cops .
came here on a whim cause i was hungry i must say happy i stopped here because the food was great .
great service healthy portions and authentic american breakfast and lunch go for the mexican omelette or pancakes and remember to linger over a cup of coffee in a place where people have taken a break from life for almost a century .
went here twice first time was good second time became ill on the seafood dish would not go back again .
loved the waiting snaks though i did not have any we loved all that we ordered and got great service i just wish they fixed things up a bit and cleaned up a bit more .
be really careful here the waiters will charge you more than what you actually put down on the receipt for tips .
cheap and tasty .
stay away you will be sick .
im kind of torn about this place from a food and service standpoint this place is great the girl i was dating at the time broke up with me shortly thereafter eating here with her so i associate toms as the last supper oh well life goes on .
totally unacceptable celebrating my sisters graduation and weve sat down for 20 minutes and they havent taken our order yet it also took 20 minutes for the waiter to bring us water i didnt even want to rate any stars for this restaurant .
never fails to please and run by very nice and generous people while you are waiting for a table during the brunch rush they serve free coffee lemonlime ice water french fries etc excellent breakfastbrunch fare at very fair prices love this place .
ordered a margherita pizza pick up it felt saltier than usual margherita pizza its not omg this is the best pizza ever but i guess this is ok for grab and go wont go there again .
an experience crowded at 10 on a saturday had a good time .
the bread is old and it looked moldy the hygiene of the cutlery and dishes is pretty low the dishes do not even try to resemble italian however the entre course was nice the personnel is friendly but behaves frustrated overall never again .
a legend the lines move quickly and youll be well treated with goodies while you wait these folks really know how to treat their clientele even though they dont really have to given their reputation .
got the veal burger this might have been an ok burger but the cook burned the bun thats all i tasted why wouldnt he just give me a new bun had the pizza here and it was ok at best this was the last try at this place .
delicious like literally everything was delicious may come back tomorrow one star off for only accepting cash .
serves was good but the food was a c at best seasoning was good however the food was dry and could have used more sauce .
pros the pancakes and flavored butters are excellent and the vibe is awesome cons everything else long waits on saturday and sunday to get a table and lets face it this is just diner food people .
what a disappointmentespecially curious about pizzatried the goat cheese usually try plain first but what the heck no flavor crust not crustly give me first and last or the usual new haven crowd pizza anytime would not go back .
these were the most amazing pancakes of my life i dreamt of them every single day we were in new york i will savor my picture of them forever lemon ricotta all the way .
8 for 4 tiny cold veal meatballs not given any bread sorella burger dry and disappointing not going back .
this was the best place i think i have ever eaten at i loved it so much and i loved the location because i lived in prospect heights for years everyone is very nice and the food is great i love you guys .
not a good spot for hanging out at the bar if you are with a group of 5 or more too crowded .
tasted pretty good on the first try my girlfriend wasnt satisfied with the steak because it tasted of too much charcoal the flavor of the meat was overpowered by the taste of the grill my meal on the other hand was great will try again .
the service here is terrible the bartender is incredibly rude and the food is mediocre at best the main bartender yelled at us and was very rude to us because we wanted to pay a check between three credit cards .
onion rings walnut pancakes and a chocolate shake accompanied by genuinely friendly wait staff and truly strange decor couldnt make me happier on a sunday morning when im on the hunt for a decidedly unpretentious brooklyn brunch thank you toms i am still full .
not worth visiting extremely incompetent staff poor service incredibly rude disgusting trashy regulars go elsewhere old news with the emphasis on old .
this breakfast is banging .
been there a couple of times now has decent live music but the place was completely empty maybe 130 was too late but a little surprised how dead things were supposed to be some sort of historic place but was generally unimpressive .
good food long wait .
mediocre bland food nice old building but its not like new york is wanting for those i shouldnt trust a single local opinion over checking yelp i thought as we ate here with a friend but it looks like yelp would have failed us too .
good food really good coffee had the spinach and cheese omelet my friend had the lemon ricotta pancakes my only ding is that they brought my friends food out like 10 minutes after mine yeah id probably go back .
had better chicken then this place .
mango pancakes cherrylime ricky eggs over medium beef sausage toast grits and oh steak lol can you tell this is my favorite breakfast spot in all of new york despite the long line when my family comes to visit we go two days in a row .
the ambience here is amazing the setting service is great especially in the warmer days but 34 for two tiny crab cakes is absurd will definitely come back as its a really fun place with beautiful view but only for drinks .
i loved this place so olden timey and fun sure you have to wait on line outside in the freezing cold but they bring you coffee and their sausage amazing which makes the wait well worth it get a milkshake .
all i can say now is this place got bad again if they didnt have such a great bar and outdoor space they would probably go out of business food no longer good just ok prices went up not worth it to me any longer to go bakc .
my favorite breakfast in all of brooklyn you cannot beat the ten differents kinds of huge pancakes for 7 .
this was a serious disappointment drinks were lousy food was expensive and served cold for what they charge for a steampot i would expect more than 1 piece of 3 crabs go to clementes in sheepshead bay better food and lots of it for the money .
the staff is nice the food is cheap and the decor is rad the food is consistently good although not mindblowing but ill keep coming back because this place always transports me out of ny for a much needed moment two eggshomefriestoast 5 bucks .
you cant eat atmosphere .
get the 222 2 eggs 2 pancakes 2 bacon banging delicious but with toms either you get it or you dont if you dont thats your fault and nobody elses .
smells like a porta potty first floor only had 2 beers moisture was building up inside their hard liquor bottles .
tom has never fed me anything not good here 1 star for the wait time but 1 star for their samples during the wait .
nothing special about this restaurant the food was tasteless and not filling plus the portions are small and bad quality the only enjoyable thing here was the atmosphere the views and we had a great waiter the setting 4 stars the service 4 stars the food 1 star .
best pancakes eggs are average specialty drinks are exceptional no longer live in the neighborhood but will make the train ride back without food just to get breakfast .
did not live up to the hype it was kind of like an overpriced captain ds very overpriced the location was cute but if you are going to eat dont .
fyi the cherry lime rickeys get one free refill per glass and they taste great .
youre paying for the view otherwise not very exciting manhattan drink prices .
stumbled in for a meal while waiting on my car repair great old school diner atmosphere got my usual cheese omelet and homefries hard to mess up but few impress food was great will definitely be back .
if you dont want to pay 8 for a hot dog for your child you can walk a block over to ikea and get one for 50 cents that said if you want the chips and drink too youre looking at 2 25 .
orgasmic breakfast crab cakes and cinnamon and banana pancakes yum .
not just disappointing but really really bad food and it wasnt even a busy night the beer was flat and the crab cakes were like hockey pucks they were 28 and only came with a sad piece of kale on the side .
wow toms is a great restaurant with top quality food fair prices excellent service nothing foodie about it no coulis or reduction to be seen thank the lord just yummy yummy food try the mangoblueberrywalnut pancakes .
bad biz management 40m wait 2 of 3 floors empty huh policy make diners wait to slow kitchen bad biz to not serve cust mgmt 101 keep customers there offer drinks specials and apologize for understaffed kitchen dont send us away bc your shorthanded dumb .
well everyone was right the lemon ricotta pancakes were delicious as was the cherry lime ricky everything was decently priced and the service was friendly gotta love classic new york diners .
ridiculously overpriced for totally blah food a regrettable experience fool me once .
holy crap amazing food and very reasonably priced i got the crabcake florentine with a side of beef sausage it was incredible i will absolutely be going back .
two stars because the space is really nice in the evening for sunset but the food was such a profound disappointment fried clams and oysters are coated in way too much batter cant even taste the seafood like eating fried dough gross .
this is probably my favorite breakfast place when theres a line they hook you up with plenty of snacks during the wait make you feel like a king then once you get your table the service is solid and the food is amazing .
just awful lousy inediible food terrible service you need to go to a cooler and get your own water and crazy prices but breathtaking views and nice mini golf go to lobster by the pound or little neck for good seafood or alma for great views and service .
this one lives up best breakfast in new york hands down .
if you want to get ripped off and deal with the worst fucking service imaginable then yes come here also why is there still a wait stop coming here .
classic brooklyn this is one of my very favorite brunch spots awesome pancakes and special butters the prices are good and so are the decorations .
ok just get a beer at the bar beautiful view not expensive however i made the mistake to eat here 1 12 hour wait sit down and are told that about a third of the entrees are not available food mediocre and really expensive for what it is .
amazing brunch .
crazy anal chick waiter with braids and sweater needs to take a fuckin chill pill was yelling at us all night when we just dropped over three grand at their joint in one night would have been a pleasant experience without the tude .
other notable pancake joints have gotten praise press and have their fun marketing ploys with monthly flavors you know who they and you are sorry but toms still reigns supreme consistently good they have their style of doing things and it works pancakes omg the freakin pancakes .
the prices are cartoonishly high so many better seafood spots with reasonable prices no thanks .
this place is the shiz you get orange slices and cookies before your meal its a historic kind of place dont expect fine dinning just good honest grub .
been here two hours plus havent had a single piece of seafood but the oyster crackers are delicious definitely no stars .
great place to eat they feed you free food while you wait on line and they have hamturkey bacon yum the service is outstanding .
love this restaurant but i just had a bad experience trying to book a private party with them this business needs to find someone else to run their private party booking .
if you want comfort food thats tasty and reason toms is the place to go the service is amaaazing they even give you slices of oranges as you are waited to be seated in that looong line 5 stars .
i adore fish in claypot with vietnamese caramel sauce nuoc mau the version here is not that good the sauce was too salty kind of thin and it was more expensive than the cheap vietnamese places i usually go to .
blueberry walnut mango pancakes never stood a chance fantastical fruit festival in my mouth a must for brunch .
perhaps vietnam was too hyped but i prefer pho ha in south philly .
classic new york diner with an excellent breakfast it was entirely packed with an early crowd prices were very reasonable .
usually love this place especially for take out but they are getting really rude on the phone .
the line was long and the food worth the wait 30 fun minutes outside the place with the chef bringing cookies fruits and coffee awesome .
got dragged back to north third against my will still the worst service in philly super obnoxious female bartenders especially in the back bar and mediocreoverpriced food skip it and go anywhere else youve been warned .
okay toms i have to admit it was only a first date and im still on the fence as to if i should call you back or drop you a text as i know how many other suitors you have but damn that mexican omelet was delicious .
have not been here in over a year and the special menu was the same .
legendary and almost always as good as the hype the mexican omelet is my goto they are ultra friendly and usually fast though service can be unfocused and inefficient at times bottom line good enough for susanne vega good enough for me .
totally overrated can i get a flashlight so i can read my menu same boring items for years now try somewhere else .
a consistent and classic crowdpleaser .
crap food crap crowd not much to say about this place if you already go somewhere else for pints and food dont stop but if youre familiar with the neighborhood i probably dont have to tell you that .
the snack guy gave us a plate of fries while we waited the whole thing i was ridiculously hungover so this was the best thing to ever happen to me that day at least .
i guess i dont really understand the hype ive had a few dinners and one breakfast here and thought the food was mediocre at best service was ok but i did have an amazing bloody mary .
good food good service everything was prompt and delicious .
im sure this place is great if you go at the right time but i went at 3pm just as brunch was ending and i got what tasted like microwaved food for a high price .
i love this restaurant great food wonderful staff fabulous atmosphere inexpensive only its not open sundays which is my favorite day for brunch .
bread was good but the food is saltier than nonas personality and thats pretty salty .
best diner ive been to in a while banana walnut pancakes were off the hook recommend to go early after 12 pm line out the door .
this place food wise is extremely mediocre its not worth the money they charge .
i cant wait to go back for the lemon ricotta pancakes damn they are good so fluffy and tasty .
my friend convinced me to go to northern spy there is a line for sunday brunch and i dont understand why the food is marginal and the place is cramped the table next to us is 4 inches away this place is all hype .
delicious clean bright comfortable yummy breakfast all day and its the toms susanne vega wrote the awesome song about thats a plus the only downside no milkshakes great chocolate egg creams though .
if i could give zero stars i would refused to seat me until my friend arrived which i could understand if it were moderately busy however this place is literally empty save for one table of three in a corner really get over yourselves ridiculous .
yummm the wait was a little long but it was worth it we got water coffee orange slices cookies strawberries in whipped creme while we waited in line the food was great get the homefries .
oof came here with my girlfriend for the duck fat fries and each plate was met with shoulder shrugs and at least the fries are coming then the fries came and we were left even more disappointed .
haiku to toms by julie k lemon drizzle pork pumpkin pancakes so scrumptous tickles my insides bottomless coffee you are my morning glory mmm mmm mmm mmm mmm .
brunch limited menu do not order the pulled chicken sandwich there is nothing that resembles pulled nor chicken it had a terrible metallic taste like boiled chicken biscuits were quite good though .
its been a while since we ate here but i remember it being very good affordable and the owner was so awesome .
do any of the staff actually want to work here i came here yesterday for brunch and it was an outright frown fest frowns all around frowntown and slow service and small portions the food was good but turn that frown upside down .
friendliest service ive ever seen in a diner great atmosphere if i lived there id be there every weekend for brunch im sure many people have spoken eloquently about this place i just wanted to add my little comments .
meh not worth the wait better options for the money tried cornbeef hash and pulled chicken sandwich would not go again .
best eggcream in the city i live on the same block as this place and it takes huge amounts of self control to not go down there and get a chocolate egg cream every single day that said go get one youll thank me .
rude host small portions unjustifiably pricey dont let the hype fool you the food at northern spy food co falls way short from remarkable .
they have a new chipotle sauce delish say hi to gus and his wife nonnie when youre there try the tuna melt im a die hard breakfast fan harvest pancakes with sweet corn and cranberries are tasty but recently made the switch to tuna melts and im hooked .
the dishes all were too fresh in terms of flavor maybe its the chives dinner for 2 housemade head cheese watercress salad freekeh risotto long island market fish fettuccine with mushrooms housemade ice cream carrot cake .
this place looks like my grandmothers plus i am in love with the location and the fact that it hasnt been laid siege to by the painfully hip everyone there is just looking for some goooood breakfast man and thats what matters .
this place is kinda dead not really worth checking out the drinks are pretty cheap and the dj seemed to be pretty good there was just not much of a crowd here when i went during a friday night .
guilty pleasure .
still the same tired place owners have upped the prices and djs play the same music every night not worth it .
great pancakes .
its not your typical new york style pizza theres less cheese and more unusual things are experimented with youll get a 2 inch tall monster of a slice so dont order 2 imagine if hamburgão made pizza .
i like this place they serve you cookies and oranges while you wait for a seat their breakfasts are good and the pancakes are even better so what if the tables are really close together who can say no to an oldfashioned type establishment .
soooooooo when did it become ok for people to not wear gloves when handling food definitely not cool and i wont be coming here again .
fantastic we just went for the first time the decor is great the service is great food is good very nice experience .
hot slices cold service not worth the price but not bad for where it is .
its really sad that people dont have time for breakfast anymore but if you do please do yourself a favor and stop by toms they serve those really great big traditional breakfasts itll make you start eating real breakfasts again .
my wife and i went last saturday evening were seated next to a large noisy obnoxious party totally spoiled the dining experience our waiter nor the manager were able to help to quiet this crowd and were not proactive in moving our table until i had to complain .
i order from here often usually get the dealers choice subs theyre pretty good and big the nachos are also good the mozzarella sticks and curly fries are a must have .
the atmosphere is nice however the waitress was annoying pushing us to buy more and more the sizes of the plates were ridiculously small and offensive they were so small that make feel sad additionally it was fatty and oily so why such a high price .
when i dont have lunch i go to this place and they have excellent costumer service they are all very friendly and i love their specials and i really like their chicken empanadas .
really really not outstanding im not sure what philly mag got all worked up about a highlight was the agnilotti food took forever to arrive octopus primi did not even rival dmitris save your cash .
i enjoy their food and especially their smoothies those are delicious the staff is also friendly .
i was going to try this place out but the guy in the pix with no gloves on holding a chili dog said hot dogs dont taste as good wit gloves on so ill pass shrug .
definitely some of the best cuban food ive had i love their croquettes especially the cheese one also the saturday special ox tail is super delicious the regular ropa vieja and roast pork are also really yummy the staff is really friendly and we received great service .
dont ask for more tzatziki sauce it will cost you 1 50 quality and quantity of food have sadly gone down hill there are plenty of other good diners to choose from where you wont be upcharged for any extras .
i love this place its authentic cuban food and fairly priced .
smells good when you walk in pretty much a normal dennys type diner but the food was kinda gross and the service wasnt great .
great service good prices great food my fav is the cuban sandwhich and the ropa vieja yummmmyyy .
quick take overrated try to go for dinner and order breakfast items that way you wont have to stand in line for 23 hours good luck .
the beauty of a sales life on the road you find little gems like this along the way authentic and delicious cuban food inexpensive as well enjoy .
waited one hour and half on a saturday not worth it at all pancake was soggy omelette was bland like many other yelpers who came here because of its popularity on yelp i would not recommend it at all .
got to hand it to this place tasty affordable food with great service i feel like my grandma is working the kitchen empanadas are solid and only a buck papas rellenas at 1 50 cant beat this place no need to go into newark to get caribbean cuisine .
would not recommend this place 23 hour wait took my phone number and never received a text or call as they stated plenty of tables were open in the restaurant process for seating people seemed very inefficient .
so good love this place great non pretentious down to eart cafeteria cuban food .
honestly the food is good but its not the best i feel this place is a bit too commercial for the neighborhood just a tip get there early for the line .
much better than expected the juices are simply amazing .
bad service automatic 20 tip high prices charge extra for sauces not impressed really the waiter was rude probably because he thought hed get his tip anyway he didnt .
love the cuban food the service and the prices .
its a pretty good pancake place but its one of the try once but never ever go again i dont think any pancake is worth a 1 12 2 hour wait .
the best cuban restaurant in kearny hands down loving all these new local places fridays they have bacalao my favoriate .
i wonder how they got a 4 star review extra 2 dollar for additional syrup are you kidding me the food is nothing special not worth the 2hour wait they asked you to wait while there are empty seats .
very good food they make you feel at home .
tourist trap .
excellent food prices are low everyone is very friendly i can eat from there everyday .
sorry i am not able to rate the food it may be very good but i am not willing to wait for two hours just for some breakfast on top of that with a very stressed and unfriendly waitress no thanks .
stumbled into this restaurant with my family while strolling the streets on a nice evening very friendly very professional very good service and we all have a great meal .
food is overpriced for what you get i mean its pancakes folks ihop does better pancakes for alot less and you dont have to be squeezed into a tiny table and wait 2 hours avoid .
omg to be far away from home and to find the place that made us feel at home and welcomed generous cocktails fabulous appetizers dinner still to come .
overrated im sure theyre a pioneer in the brunch scene but great brunch places are popping up all over manhattan now so theres no reason to wait the ridiculous duration for a table here .
being an out of towner i was quite pleased with the atmosphere and the drinks if i had to pick something bad id say the service could be a little better overall though its a great place for a drink and meeting up with friends .
sunday 1036 am nobody answered the phone pick up the phone .
great places for dinner and drinks the short ribs are fantastic and so is the caesar salad .
just a very hyped restaurant the pancakes were okay but nothing more i would not recommend waiting in line for this place in my personal opinion the food and service of schillers restaurant around the corner was superior .
a great place for friday afterwork drinks and dinner one of the best in the city .
i wish i could give this place zero stars everything is great like really but the hostess was just too mean last sunday seriously im not at some random truck around the corner and i expect more professional people oh and with better visual qualities as well .
came here with a group of colleagues nice selection of wine beer and specialty cocktails i had the steak medium rare it was cooked exactly the way i liked and well seasoned i would come back next time im in town .
nothing tastes worse than bad service and rudeness blueberry pancakes were good but i cant say for sure because the attitudes of the servers induced indigestion .
chill bar in center city definitely worth stopping by for a drink or two food is yummy as well .
cornerstone nearby is a much better choice better cheaper faster and the nicest people dont waste your time waiting here check them out on yelp .
best fresh food excellent cocktails i can truly relax laugh and be myself here .
did i miss the pancake boat i dont get it the pancakes are fine but nothing to write home about even instagram couldnt make them look tastier than they are .
scallops are really nice the veggies are also very good the waiter was relaxed and funny very nice experience .
ive been here twice the first time a few years ago and the later recently i didnt consider the pancakes to be necessarily fluffy or all that tasty i really didnt care for the butter maple syrup which was like lard this place has a lot of tourists .
love love love it here thats all no big lines or 45 minute drink orders best food and great atmosphere perfect for dinner and some drinks and great conversation every time we go here we make new friends .
over rated over priced 100 bucks for 3 pancakes and 3 shakes crazy .
one of my favorite gay bar in the city great place for happy hour lunch brunch and dinner the staff are wonderful and the drinks are strong a great meeting place to get a cocktail or two before heading to the other great barsclubs in the city .
eh its an over priced ihop pretty standard and seating is packed like sardines .
flatbreads sausage ones with brocolli and asparagus with lobster meat mac and cheese with bleu cheese how yummy it was the decor was quite warm and inviting and service was excellent what a great find in philly .
very long wait for very ordinary brunch the girl who gave people tables was extremely rude i would never recommend this place but if you go the only ok dish is the egg benedict .
i really love this place in the gayborhood its elegant and has charm the food is good and there wine list great it can be pricey so i used my credit card but well worth it during the warm nights you can sit out side .
long wait to get a table longer wait to get your food nothing too impressive i dont know what all the hype is about this place the tables are really cramped not an enjoyable place to eat breakfast lunch or brunch .
in the back this place has perhaps what is the greatest piano lounge in the entire tri state area and yelps description doesnt even mention it they run it each friday and saturday evening .
overrated i have tried the pancakes and i have definitely had better the line is not worth the food go somewhere else .
i loved knock the atmosphere was upscale and fun and the food was very good will definitely return on my next visit to philadelphia .
what the hell how is this place worth a two hour wait is beyond me dont get me wrong the food is decent but nothing spectacular definitely not worth waiting two hours i think its sketchy that its a cash only business too .
nice attentive staff complimented by good food the salads and soups are wellportioned and the flatbreads are delicious .
warning this is not a glutenfree restaurant my family and i went a long way to get to this place as my son has celiacs we arrived only to find a 2hour wait and they do not offer a glutenfree menu pancakes etc .
i thought i walked into a restaurant but i think i really walked into a gay bar that served pretty damn good food and stiff drinks who cares about the label it was a great meal with a bonus giggle after i ordered sliders all beef well done .
not gluten free although it comes up when i google gluten free pancakes that being said its overpriced and completely ordinary except for the extraordinarily long wait dont bother .
food is good can be a very loud place in a friday night drinks tend to have a lot of liquor asked for a rum and coke tasted like they forgot the coke .
oh word its only an hour and a half wait at 10am to sit elbow to elbow in your establishment and have 15 eggs get outta here .
the atmosphere is comfortable but a bit ragged but who cares for the price and freshness of the food this place cant be beat huge portions of delicious food for under 10 one of the servers usually speaks english .
overrated buscuits were really dry and hard pancakes were blah seriously the diner in edison nj serves better breakfast than this joint .
great food for a cheap price rice and food is always fresh cheap and the waitresses are nice you can grab a beer or alcoholic drink their pernil is alway on point their chicken is a little greasy but still delicious .
okay but not worth waiting for 1 5 hour i cannot believe it is the mostly reviewed brunch spot in manhattan on yelp i would recommend sarabeths west or balthazar instead for the quality and the taste .
great dogs great fries great prices .
after a 30 minute subway ordeal ah nothing better than nyc in the summer we arrive ready to eat a delish breakfast i order the famous pancakes while my coworker gets eggs benny while good it wasnt spectacular whats with all the fuss nyc .
seriously underdogs 9pm why cant you be open all the time lol i want a buffalo gal .
the food is good but it is way too crowded and the service is terrible it really gets in the way of enjoying yourself here .
this place is great i love hotdogs and no place better than here to expand your horizons on gourmet toppings .
no pancake is worth a 3 hour wait .
yummmy gourmet hot dogs amazing fries with a bunch of different unique dipping sauces .
nothing spectacular the pancakes were pancakes and the biscuits were biscuits i guess its the expectations that ruined it for me but honestly i could have those pancakes anywhere else the place is too small and there is nowhere to wait around overall it is overrated .
it doesnt even matter if you like hot dogs you will love hot dogs after eating here also best fries in the city well i have to go but its been really nice talking to you .
service good ambiance good food ok stopped for desert my girl told me it was great place limecoconut cake was not impressive and the scone was dry but they are famous for their pancakes so i will go back to try that and will review this review haha .
if you like specialty hot dogs or just want a hotdog this is the place to come with its variety and fry dipping sauces you cant go wrong .
i just dont really understand the food was fine but it wasnt spectacular in this most spectacular of brunches city why is the line so long why is the service so slow .
cant beat the fries with aioli mayo really good hot dogs too .
total joke i get off laughing at anyone who would line up to eat eggs and pancakes seriously this food is average maybe theres no alternatives nearby but that doesnt mean the food is so great its not csbc one more reason the les is lame .
this was the single best hot dog of my entire life before i finished it i called my parents to rave about its deliciousness this was honestly the best decision ive ever made i am thinking about going back for a dinner hot dog .
this place never ceases to amaze me the food is bland yet the crowds keep queueing for hours on end go during the week at 3pm its much easier to get in and you can actually get that this place is hyped up .
famazing the bun was the best part i kept remarking to my friend on how flaky buttery and crispy it was oh and the dawg itself was great .
last stop on my pizza crawl around city the show behind the counter was far superior to the slice i had not worth a return trip .
best selection of dogs great funky atmosphere reminds me of zippys back home only they do burgers they have gluten free buns which is great fries are hand cut and the sauces garlic aoli was todiefor .
normal pizza place nohting special except the celeb images on the wallas a pepperonin square had eight small pepperonis on it .
great cheap place to get something different 23 different dogs and great hand cut fries .
usually i love this place but the pizza this last time i went was so greasy and gross the guy who i think owns the place was also really rude nothing special bleecker street pizza is way better .
great place for awesome dogs with a twist more like an upscale dog shop plus the fries and dipping sauces are excellent .
well its ok pizza and price 2 slices 1 soda for 9 ill not go back there .
hot dogs vegetarian coney classic vegetarian california dreamin vegetarian my thai dipping sauces chipotle mayo garlic aioli horseradish mustard cash only byob order a combo eat everything remember to say vegetarian if youre into that .
worst service ever and both times we went there someone ended up getting sick portuguese place i think not needs real managers and way better quality of food .
every dog ive had here has been amazing a must for everyone dont miss this hidden gem .
i ordered the seafood paella and it was salty big portion of food gone to waste .
huge array of hot dogs and all delicious the fries are plentiful and that perfect balance of squishycrunchy be sure to try their saucesits worth the extra 25 cents .
this place has the worst food the only good thing about this place is the music and sangria .
huge variety of delicious gourmet hot dogs to try in addition to their huge variety of dogs they also have gourmet cookies and probably the best fries ive hard highly recommended its also awesome that theyre usually open until 4 am on weekends .
food is okay at most pretty pricey buffet too you will wait to be senate even though the place is empty .
my husband ate here recently and loved it the hand cut fries are divine and come with loads of cool flavored mayo options he got the equivalent of an irish allday breakfast on a bun must be tried .
i wasnt really impressed by essex grand buffet i dont expect to be wowed by anything at a buffet but i expect to at least find some decent stuff everything i tried ranged from mediocre sushi to pretty bad egg roll there are better buffet experiences out there .
i moved to philly a few months ago and this is by far one of my favorite places to eat at enough said if youre a local and you arent doing the wall of fame challenge you are stupid i love you underdogs .
it is what it is chinese buffet for americans its good value for your money but im afraid thats all i can say about it .
there are dozens of combinations of hot dogs you can get here spicy mediterranean mexican texan i cant even remember the types i just remember having a full stomach and delicious experiencefor less than 10 .
weird tasting food and a waitress who acted like she really didnt want to be there sassafras was much better in my opinion .
i really like this place the fires are awesome and both dogs ive tried have been fantastic .
the worst bar food ive ever had but the waitress was nice the atmosphere is cool the food dont eat it .
a for the marrakesh a good place to grab a cheap fast and delicious bite in the rittenhoue neighborhood the huge menu definitely has something for everyone ill be back to try out the other combos bonus star for staying open til 4am during the wknd .
we were promised a reservation only to be turned away saying reservations were not on weekends not recommended .
i ordered 2 different veggie dogs and fries tonight and they were all great and delivered in 15 min .
the food is excellent but my party was here on a saturday night and we had to wait at least 20 minute for service after we were seated before anyone came by to take our order unacceptable .
love it .
got the grilled cheese last saturday thrown together poorly made wilted garnish skimpy ingredients and wont be back lots of hype but lacking sorry .
ive had the texas tommy and the chili dog whatever its called on the menu great dogs cheap prices theyre open late as well i stop here all the time on my walk back to the train .
burger horribilis seriously dreckful crappa gagulator .
all their various hotdogs have a vegetarian counterpart inclusive and delicious .
just ok you are better off to walk 15 seconds to another place nothing great .
great variety of hotdog sandwiches with yummy toppings and sides great stop for an after party bite .
meat quality just ok tasted better over rated try johns a roast pork no bob or beer served either .
ive only had their texas tommy and the warsaw packed i do like the fries and they give you a ton of greasy fries in a bag plus a variety of sauces i definitely want to come back here and try all the dogs on their menu .
great cheesesteak lousy service miss attitude behind the reg needs a new job wont return because of her unfriendly manners yelling and slamming food sat with my wife and another couple from fla sunday aug 3 1 pm .
i wasnt sure how a thai hotdog with green papaya and peanut sauce would taste but it was pretty good the dog was good quality toothis place is perfect for a latenight snack .
i thought the cheesesteak was great however i waited over 45 minutes in line and there were probably only 10 people in front of me personally i dont think it was worth the wait .
they use tofurkey brats as veggie dogs here which scores big points with me as a vegan theyre pretty fairly priced for what you get i got the chicago style dog and loved it ill be going back soon theyre also open til 4am on weekends .
i heard about this famous cheese steak and was disappointed the service is good but cheesesteak is not great the fact they cooked the meat without oil takes away the flavor of the cheesesteak i taste even better cheesesteak in ny go to jims steak it is better .
just ate here definitely going to be going back .
we stopped in this famous place to try a philly cheesesteak it was dry and unflavoured omg i was so disappointed .
i love the rice with chicken .
horrible service wont listen to a simple order doesnt care when they make a mistake .
friendly great service delicious reasonably priced food delicious chicken inside was a bit dated but it just added to the overall experience .
so disappointed ive heard great things about this place but they failed to deliver horrible customer service the environment was dirty as were the staff the food was ok never going back .
ate here this afternoon had eaten in the hartford site but found this to be a real treat ceviche mixto was fresh and delicious and the chaufa de mariscos was super and enormous great service nice people read review at mofongoman blogspot com .
sorry not impressed this place might have been good in the day i had 4 cheesesteaks in 4 days while in philly and this was the lowest grade product in town .
i love this place im a vegetarian and the food is fresh and cooked perfectly my only complaint they dont take credit cards it does limit the number of times i come in but if they took credit cards id definitely be in more often .
couldnt even see the cheez whiz on my husbands cheesesteak pretty sure we both got food poisoning later that night .
real deal alert husband wife owned and operated husband in back wife in front the chef is a master of his craft and the service is haphazardly charming will definitely be back .
food is nothing special steaks are expensive and staff was totally rude not going back here .
this place serves very authentic taiwanese food i ordered sauteed water spinach with beef in taiwanese sa cha sauce and it was amazing the vegetable dumplings were just the way my grandfather would make it i would highly recommend this place .
run of the mill cheesesteaks .
very impressed by the authenticity of their taiwanese food beefnoodle soup stinky tofu and fried chinese donuts are spot on cash only and waiting time is a little bit long its worth for the wait .
8pmish on a sunday night so not too many dining options had passed by sonnys before and thought id give it a try small expensive sandwich with tough tendony chewy meat unless faced with no other option i cant see returning .
authentic taiwan food .
is not as good as i it advertise .
probably the best chinese restaurant in the area their food is wonderful only drawback is the lack of atmosphere if they could upgrade that id give them 5 stars .
unfortunately i was overall disappointed with my experience here the food was below mediocre the soup specials were bland and served at room temperature the decor of the restaurant is far superior to the kitchens product i definitely expected more .
good food and nice place recommend will definitely go again .
although the ambiance is cute the food and drinks were extremely underwhelming and the service wasnt great either i had high hopes for the gnocchi but it was very heavy and onedimensional .
awesome taiwanese food in orange my wife and i were so glad to find this place it is a family run business the lady was very sweet and friendly food was tasty and authentic we will be back often .
its a popular place thats about it food was below average like other reviews the best part of the meal was the cold cuts platter which they dont make will not be back .
ideal place for breakfast leave your gluten fee calorie counting friends at home cause this is a diner in the truest sense of the word omlettes and egg combos are never disappointing .
awful food actually i have had better pasta on an airplane cramped and snotty greeter avoid .
great breakfast huge portions best in north haven .
love the food here but some of the waiters treat you very cold did not like the service is like the moment you get here they look at you like if you are bothering them .
chuck the fast food and get into shape ive lost 30 lbs eating better at this place for lunch everyday i cant believe eating healthy can taste this good try them out .
ugh .
try the protein brownie it is amazing make sure you have milk with it .
my friend and i saw this restaurant with 4 stars on yelp so we went here but only found the food is disappointing only the eggplant dish is good all the others salmon mustdish is about average at most .
little disappointed lately buffalo chicken salad is always decent can be mild or super hot though very let down by the greek wrap all lettuce skimpy amount of chicken and barley any cheese or sauce would go back just not for a wrap .
quite disappointing a very very noisy place with mediocre service appetizers were good the entrees were overdone and not tasty and pricey for what we experienced wont go back and wont recommend there are many other delicious places to eat .
great food simple healthy and tastes great fast service friendly staff .
food was great and our waitress was really nice however two words food poisoning later on that night i ended up getting really sick as did my boyfriend the following morning dont plan on going back anytime soon .
i absolutely love this place it gives you a healthy option for anything that youre craving from pancakes to burgers also for the price you get a lot of food the wraps are literally bursting the protein shakes are delicious and huge too try the nutty professor .
medieval looking interior nice garden brunch was rich although a little expected and uninspired .
4 star for the ahi tuna wrap it is the best the place is pretty expensive but the tuna is worth it .
i wasnt impressed at all everything i tried was just average or not good sundried tomato bruschetta this was probably the best thing i tried wild mushrooms bruschetta pretty bland ricotta gnocchi carbs in creamy sauce not worth the calories .
great idea to keep people eating better and healthy .
wine only review beware dark intimate atmosphere decent wine list which is a generous statement the staff could take some cues from those who actually know how to serve in the um service industry i wont be back .
outstanding wraps huge real health food not pretend wanna be like fuel homemade quality taste dont be put off by the prices as they do reflect the food quality of this establishment .
been wanting to try this place for a while the black truffle gnocchi was not chewy the way i like it too soft flavor was just okay the veal pappardelle was good not incredible good service the ambiance was the best part of this place .
i now live in california and i wish we had a place that served healthy yummy food like this there .
ordered lamb i love lamb and usually finish it all but not this one food was not good at all my friend ordered pasta also not good at all disappointing .
food was awesome good atmosphere and loved the honey crust pizza highly recommend the bbq pizza a must check out .
pizza was good at the first time i went there the second time i felt like i was eating a cardboard they burned my pizza .
friendly unpretentious staff delicious food and drinks nothing was too spicy or bland cant wait to go again and try different entrees .
i will be dining here in a few days so as i was looking at the menu and salivating i wonder what kind of wine bar doesnt post their wine menu online .
its been several years since i have been here hopefully it wont be that long again went during restaurant week and everything was so good its a small space so be sure to make a reservation .
our waiter was a big jerk so we got up and left i will never ever go there again .
yummy motofu really yummy dessert flan de ambiente went there for lunch on a sunday tiny place very popular because of the good food be sure to reserve a table ahead of time only downside high prices for all items will be back for more .
liked good service the host and waiter were great meat stuffed olives pork sausage wish were different porchetta tasted like turkey from the walmart deli food service was pretty slow .
fast and good savory food tell me how to make those rice and beans if only the coke werent actually pepsi .
come on this is not a japanese restaurant or a sushi bar its just a normal fast food with some japanese style name if you come here to find some sashimi you will really disappointed i hate california roll .
great family restaurant authentic cuban food a the guy mike that runs the place is very friendly along with the rest of the staff super professional very good food i highly recommend the oxtail its amazing i couldnt ask for more .
the sushi is average i liked the dragon roll their burgers are utter rubbish brgr is better .
bravo .
this is like the chipotle of japanese food edible but not worth going back for .
omg the drinks were amazing and the food was delioucous yes i had the cuban sandwich with freid yucka yummy the lunch menus is great and they also make the best mojitos .
food is served pretty quickly but is all lower than expected quality and the portions are small .
food was amazing my hubby and i both got great vegetarian dishes and there were more to choose from yet the yuca fries were also great cant wait to go back make a reservation as this place is very small the service was okay .
omg horrible this place is fake and not for anyone who is somewhat fussy about food i had beef bowl but this is not what you call a beef bowl never going back if you want fast food go to five guys .
loved it yuka frites were a great twist on french fries atmosphere is small and cozy and friendly great selection of drinks and some really nice authentic cuban dishes we will be back .
how do you make chicken taste gamey fail total disappointment with rice bowl .
food and drinks are both excellent but a tad overpriced ambience is good and no wait for dinner during week nights .
came here to order the beef bowl it was 10 75 and was 95 rice and vegetables the meal was so greasy there was literally a layer of oil at the bottom i was not impressed and will not order from here again .
nice small place very friendly staff and food was excellent would definitely return .
the mcdonalds version of japanese food .
fell in love with the place its nice and cozy the food is out standing and im latin so i would know about latin food went their for brunch also very very good my favorite place .
dont get wrong idea this is not really a korean food eatery the chicken bowel i got is good but tasted just like teriyaki chicken not spicy korean food .
tiny restaurant make sure to make a reservation for dinner they have delicious cocktails and worldclass ropa vieja the interior and decorations are unique and tell the story of the owner and his family there is also a soul de cuba in hawaii .
the food at kobeyaki was very ordinary it is an ok option in the area given that many of the other places to eat are fast food establishments .
bomb cuban food i had an appointment nearby and stopped for lunch based on the high yelp reviews i wasnt disappointed i tried their cuban soul sandwich and it was awesome looking forward to going back my only complaint is prices are a bit on the high side .
very small and you share a table with others good burger .
one of the best places for cuban sandwiches .
the service was great the food was ok .
soul de cuba has been one of my favorites for years now i highly reccommend everything as i have probably tried it all do not leave without having a sangria or mojito period .
an utter disappointment four great bands i know were scheduled to play there and management cancelled on them an hour before doors opened with no explanation whats worse than a music venue that doesnt treat musicians appropriately nothing .
my favorite spot in new haven try the pan con pescado daily before 5pm and the sangria is absolutely the best in the city its the founders grandfathers recipe and it is perfection great energy in this place too .
place sucks big time took over an hour to get simple wings and fries you dont want to go here never again ever .
great mojitos and yuca fries the place is small so you should definitely call ahead the kitchen is also tiny so it takes a while for the food but its well worth the wait .
dirty loud sticky floors crappy rundown venue if thats your thing more power to you i cant stand the place .
this place is cute i went here long time ago like 6 years ago i had chicken with rice and it was actually very good their drinks were nice i liked the atmosphere the most .
the place is average the food and service was nothing exceptional especially if you factor in the prices i live close by and my buddy and i went there one night to try the place the ambience is good the food is average .
small restaurant but excellent food and good prices .
awful service and really really really slow for take out plan to pick your food up 45 minutes or more after youve ordered i recommend finding somewhere else to pick up food from unless you dont mind waiting a long time .
first time here and i have to say the food was delicious had bistec and it was cooked and seasoned just right made me go back in time to my moms cooking we will be a back for sure .
i hate to disagree with so many fellow yelpers but this joint is over rated the food is subpar the service only soso the atmosphere unimpressive except for the courtyard the courtyard is lovely if you bring your own food its a wonderful place to dine .
i rarely have cuban food but i like the food here a little pricey for two people we had one appetizer and two main dishes that cost 62 something but the service is good their coffee is good too .
for food fantastic i would have given it 5 stars until you see the jerk they call the owner so inappropriate with people and staff its sad how miserable he is if ever this place fails it will be because of him .
a really great venue wtih superb food it really feels like havana long ago before castro took over the staff is very friendly and give a 100 effort .
the popularity of this place puzzles me i feel like its one of those places people feel like they are supposed to love and overlook the crap food and annoying ambiance a hundred other better places in the area .
quaint place good service extremely authentic went for lunch and tried the sandwiches chicken was awesome and perfectly breaded salad dressing a little sweet prices are otherwise a bit pricey i will be back for dinner though really wanna try some of their dinner entrees .
come prepared with a xanax and ear plugs .
great little place good atmosphere but it is definitely a tight fit on a weekend night so reservations are best good authentic dishes with a mix of their own stuff great mojitos and margarhitas too .
totally overrated so many people when they hear we live in montclair ask about this place so disappointing the food and service are really lacking there are so many better places in this town that i would highly encourage you to pass .
everything here is great awesome environment and very attentive staff reservations suggested for groups andor weekend evenings .
was there for my friends birthday long ass wait the food was so mediocre had the chicken con mango no flavor the rice was horrible the cook doesnt believe in salt i think never again .
good bar better than average food .
def hyped up super disorganized food is not fresh and everyone is ontop of eachother first and last time .
yummy .
beans had very little flavor ropa vieja was too salty service was slow churrasco tasted burnt may be the grill wasnt cleaned off .
amazing food the wait staff is always friendly and there when you need them kind of small though felt like i was on a double date with the table next to me .
did not care for it overrated and service subpar the manager is a true jackass has absolutely no concept of customer service .
went for brunch and loved it a little pricy maybe but overall worth it drinks were good and lots of veggie potions .
worst food worst staff overpriced crap .
pretty good a little expensive for what it is but huge portions and delicious food .
its loud and kind if uncomfortable the staff didnt come around enough for us to enjoy dinner the sangria tasted like a disgusting fruit juice so we walked to the liquor store bought wine and added to it overall not such a pleasant experience .
large portions friendly service pleasant ambience the tapas sampler is full of cold meats though .
food was delicious and fairly inexpensive thats great as youll need the for hearing aids as the music is deafening because of that i would not come back and youll find an average wait of 30 mins with all the options in montclair why would i bother .
oh man love this restaurant they have amazing flan amazing bread pudding amazing dishes their alcoholic beverages are also fairly nice i might have gotten a rum punch or sangria sometimes i just come for a slice of their exquisite flan .
you know its bad when you order and your food comes out 3 minutes later this place is like disneyworld actually i have had better food there .
sangria is fruity and just right calamari is soft and crispy try the sampler maybe good for 34 people huge portions lunch sandwiches are tasty make sure to call ahead for reservations because small space and gets crowded .
cuban petes has lost its edge .
great food at a decent price they put their own spin on a variety of classic cuban dishes .
only a few cars in lot plenty of open tables and were offered a seat at the bar really stopped by once before and thought the place was pretentious now im sure i wont return and predict they wont be here for long anyway .
this is one of new havens treasures small yet cozy food is great prices are good and you never leave hungry their shredded pork is my favorite not a big fan of ropa vieja .
they have half price rolls when they first opened their hand rolls were really nice as time passes theyre getting smaller and smaller i understand theyre running a special but not good to be inconsistent especially if youre trying to get customers .
loml and i both had sandwiches she ordered pollo epanizado chicken breast and i went with pan con pescado tilapia both perfectly prepared with unique tastes and an interesting side salad fast and friendly service in a pleasant atmosphere cant wait to go back finally something different .
the titanic has sunk dont go here looking for treasures your will only find crap this place is bad there are many many places in ironbound i live here and this isnt one of them .
thumbs up meal was very flavorful and good portions for the price better than nyc cuban places with good price friendly staff a plus .
this portuguese restaurant was pretty forgettable the paella was meh with the service to match wont be going again .
excellent cubano sandwiches excellent salad eveything was very fresh service was a little weak when it came to refills for beverages glasses were completley empty and we were left waiting for a several minutes all in all food was outstanding cute and very clean resturant .
just dont waste your time went there with my boyfriend for our anniversary dinner as we waited for our entrees a mouse ran by my feet and into the wall behind me enough said waiter was nice place was in need of a major renovation .
i love this place excellent service and atmosphere vegetarianvegan friendly they have a mojo tofu dish that is amazing and if you dont want that they will happily recommend other veg options i highly recommend this place .
generally sad made for an unknowing customer greasy chips nondescript salsa a cut about taco bell seriously the place needs help in the kitchen .
ceviche as excellent and cuba libre was better then i could have made myself .
not spicy i would prefer taco bell to this .
love this place only cuban food in new haven doesnt compare to that in miami but this will fill my cravings .
bought the chicken caesar salad today it was a big salad but it was super salty not sure if its the dressing that i got with it ceasar or what but wow i can feel my blood pressure going up as i write this lol .
first time here and the food was wonderful lechon asado excellent mojitos almost as good as mine service was mixed manager was terrific wait service could be better all four meals were nicely done place is very small so reservations are necessary enjoy .
location is not very good but parking with valet is good option i had the caribbean ribeye which is large at 24oz but it was tough and not that tasty service was pretty slow salad bar was barely adequate the valet guy was pretty good though .
had the cuban sandwich today and it was wonderful the bread was perfectly light and crispy the inner ingredients very fresh love the pickle also had the tres leches cake for dessert excellent .
meh the service sucks and the food is nothing special .
i want a paternity test to make sure this place isnt my babys daddy .
servers and manager needs to take a course on hospitality .
the positive reviews are spot on easily one of the top 3 restaurants in new haven dont forget to make a reservation .
so far we have waited 39 minutes for our food but they took money off meal for the lateness the food was ok im sure you can find better seafood than just ok somewhere else .
ok so dont let the last reviewer deter you this is an awesome restaurant she obviously doesnt know good food since she liked claires .
service so so food over cooked and dry nothing was good .
cute spot great cuban food the restaurant is tiny though which could make it uncomfortable if youre on a date and want privacy otherwise its great for a catchup with a friend over dinner and drinks highly recommend it for the food .
the food isnt as good as it used to be put waaaay too much pepper in the fries .
first got to order the fried zucchini sticks there terrific great thin pizza and home cooked entrees just love going here just wish there was more parking .
they have a good beer selection here but i was not too impressed with the food i ordered the brat sandwich it was kind of pedestrian .
very small place with limited parking but great menu with excellent pizzas and italian fare made from fresh ingredients .
food was greasy and not very flavorful i had the portabello sandwich and my gf had a burger which she thought wasnt very flavorful either plenty of beer people were very friendly .
hard to find parking sometimes but the food is good get the tomato pie and a few rounds of beer and you will be satisfied take out orders are a pain though it is best to try to eat here .
its okay decent burgers and nachos and foods of that sort in the summer but nothing special over priced average fancy food in winter the outside area could use lots of new furniture and the bar outside is nasty .
weve been going here for years and feels like home everytime nothing fancy inside can probably use some remodeling but food and beers are great especially for such a casual place wings are some of the best around and pizza delish .
service is terrible and the food is bland the pub needs a serious makeover and the acts that they have there sound awful .
we tried this place on a whim it is awesome cheese steaks are one of the best around chicken parmesan was very good and the pizza was the best ive had in a long time service was wonderful even though the place was crowded .
the food is ok if you eat in the dining room the atmosphere is quiet and boring they are overpriced and their service is terrible .
best place in town and familyowned love that .
didnt enjoy the food much i really wanted to try some game meat but in the form of sausages they all tasted the same .
sometimes its a little crazy in here but the food is always good .
i can only echo the others this place is boring and serves mediocre food it is also expensive three major negatives .
food is great can get a bit loud and takes awhile for food to come however the bar pies are fantastic we will be back .
good food but overpriced and overhyped .
one of my favorite places around bar pies for something like 3 50 during happy hour forget about it .
first and last visit for brunch we ordered two of the simplest dishes scrambled eggs with home fries salad and bacon and eggs forty five minutes later still no food we left i will say their coffee is good .
great pizzas good service fantastic option to be to watch a game or just to enjoy a casual evening .
the food was good but not great the service on a saturday night was terrible based on other reviews id have been better off trying brunch than dinner here based on my own experience not planning to go back .
good food good prices large menu great service fun atmosphere lots of tvs small parking lot .
empty on sunday nite but still mediocre service food was also only soso crab cakes had unpleasant stringy texture and no taste def not the backfin meat the waiter claimed would not do this again .
busy atmosphere lots of fun football on the many tvs we ordered the famous bar pie it was a little well done but good friendly service and very attentive reasonable prices well be back .
stupidly expensive everything is a la carte and honestly just average burgers the staff have no idea whats on the menu .

slightly better than taco bell .
they have the best food i had a blood orange margaritas tortilla soup and for my entree grouper filet stuffed with crab meat lisa was our waitress and she was very attentive with each table .
rudest check in ever completely unwelcoming refused to honor a reservation because we were delayed a few minutes the charm of a wet blanket we were treated as if they were doing us a favor by seating us .

nice small restaurant good ambiance food was delicious mole sauce and salsa verde were legit my only issue was the guacamole serving was a bit small i couldve eaten it by my self definitely no more than 2 people a serving .
im sorry but i dont think a wine bar should have sports tvs blaring i thought the concept of wine bar was romantic sexy nope not here its crowded loud and feels like some kind of compromise destination for women afflicted with sportsnut partners .
came here again for happy hour and the food was just as good as my first visit very friendly service and generous portions .
average cheesesteaks and wings the employees were nice the business is heavily relied on the university environment if you would like to experience great cheesesteaks you might want to consider the vendor at reading terminals market .
definitely my favorite mexican restaurant in the city the enfrijoladas are amazing and are a must try for sure its a little small inside so making a reservation is good idea .
i hate to be a dissenting voice but the cheesesteak at abners when i had it was soggy and the roll lacked that crispness that makes a great philly samwich ill have to try it again maybe it was just a bad day .
probably my favorite mexican place in the city my dinner and drinks were awesome i dont know what they put on the enchiladas but its sinfully delicious .
the service is always slow and the wait staff have an i dont care attitude only drunks come in being open 24 hours is the only plus .
great place to go for mexican food if you are near south street in philly try the place out and youll definitely come back for more .
quick and cheap .
great margaritas quaint small atmosphere very intimate and after 3 trips its now a staple the food is authentic and delicious .
you will never find a more wretched hive of scum and villainy at 230am the food is beyond bad if i knew i could get away with it i would burn this place down .
small place that we stumbled upon by accident absolutely great food lovely decor with great attention to details will come back next time im visiting philly .
they beat a rat to smithereens all over the restaurant isles after it ran out of the kitchen i swear it was so horriffic the whole restaurant got up and walked out .
it was the first time we eat here it was amazing as authentic as can be for a mexican place on south street the food was fresh and the service was exceptional this aint no south of the border we will be back .

enfrijoladas with very fresh avocado yum plus an amazing pickled salad and black beans and friendly service .
this place has really great food but the service is horrible the staff has an attitude every single time i go there and its like they hate their jobs if youre not spanish or you dont speak it they have an even bigger attitude .
food and atmosphere are excellent .
massively overrated hipster joint food is average at best wont be back .
great neighborhood gem everything on the menu is yummy and having authentic mexican local is awesome the fish is all fresh and the the guacamole is delicious there is not a plethora of seating space so certainly make a reservation in advance enjoy .

postfratsorority crowd warning beer pong maybe if youre 10 years younger took over half an hour to make a couple of burgers forgot part of our order ehhh wont be coming here again .
surprisingly good familiar mexican menu in a very nice space .
dive bar and proud of it this isnt my scene but low key and cheap for a few drinks on a weeknight 10 pitchers of beer good service sit at the bar or grab a table .
definitely competes with the likes of el vez and el rey the tacos pastor and the pork torta were very good next time i am there ill have to try their drinks .
called twice to see if there was a wait for a table for two no answer showed up to a two hour wait hostess was rude wont be trying to eat here again .
great mexican food have to try the lava bowl to die for only complaint is the restaurant is very small only a handful of tables .
save your money buttermilk channel is not what it once was two years ago brunch great food great service worth the money last night unfriendly staff overpriced small portions food served hardly warm .
food was great atmosphere great waitress a little abrupt but fast .
ive had better scrambles and better eggs benedict the scrambled eggs and the hash browns were very greasy although made well with a nice crisp exterior its texture could be improved by draining out the excess oil .
great local mexican eatery go for the happy hour margaritas and stay for dinner a lovely spot to bring your family and friends .
ridiculously long wait for sunday brunch do not come around 12pm 2pm unless you dont mind waiting two hours in the cold .
absolutely delicious my enchiladas were fantastic and my waiter was so attentive the restaurant is tiny but as soon as i finished with plates she picked them up which helped me feel not claustrophobic i highly recommend las bugambilias .
small portions and overprice and tight seating .
best mexican food ive had everything was extremely fresh we went when it was packed so the service was a little slow but the waitress apologized and even gave us some delicious complimentary flan for desert well definitely be back in the future .
i dont get it we went all the way from the city to experience this place with the glowing reviews it was aright i suppose service didnt impress me at all food was slightly above average yeah i just dont get it .
good food good atmosphere but needs more waiters .
the good delicious housemade sausage patties nice ambiance the bad 1 hour wait for brunch and paying 5 for a 14 of a cheddar waffle the waffle itself was ok nothing spectacular but 5 for a 3 bite waffle thats ridiculous even for a yuppie .
delicious food friendly service cozyromantic ambiance try the guacamole the chicken mole and the seafood enchiladas .
was not all that at brunch pancakes and salmon platter were mediocre bacon was very good though .
wonderful vibrant authentic little hideaway on south street staff was sweet and attentive food was muy bueno downside smallcramped all in all and place worth going back to .
meh .
amazing food and drinks only problem is its a tiny place so if its crowded you might need reservations and you will be defiantly sitting on top of others please dont go and be the loud drunk thanks .
the vibe is cool service friendly but didnt enjoy my pork chop and waffle i did enjoy my friends smoked salmon and cream cheese plate though it was very nice .
really good mexican food with amazing drinks a little on the pricey side when you include drinks but worth all the money try the mole enchiladas and amazing pink margaritas any flavor .
the fried chicken was horrible it was not fully cooked the crust was still doughy the rest of the menu looked yummy and i should have ordered other items great service good wine list just dont go there for the fried chicken .
very very very good and even though its not a byo the wine is the most affordable ive seen great experience .
mediocre at best across the board kitchen couldnt make a medium burger fried chicken was just ok but cheese waffle tasted like a belgium waffle no cheese that i could detect side dishes were all weird service was inattentive until things went wrong pass on this place .
based on margaritas and guacamole alone was starting to doubt the other reviews but then my chicken mole tradicionale arrived yum chicken was moist and delicious mole was tasty prompt and friendly service as others described nice place to spend a little time .
brunch skip it be prepared to search for the hostess like you would in one of those wheres waldo books ill admit the food was good but there are better options in the area namely seersucker over on smith and prime meats across the street on court .
i could not have been happier with my experience here the staff were welcoming responsive and fun from the moment we arrived until we left the food was beautifully presented and delicious .
i really dont get the rave reviews about this place its nothing but a pretentious joint filled with strollers and folks who have come to taste the pancakes trust me theyre not worth it and neither is the wait .
awesome mexican food enchiladas are my personal favorite great place for a date a little on the expensive side but worth it .
place is too loud at least on a friday night waited for our dish for at least 45 minutes fried chicken is good not great waffles are soft no crunch didnt order dessert i heard they are excellent glad i went but wouldnt recommended .
their soups are great its not easy to find great soup good drinks not waterdown and foods is very good .
why arent you open for brunch on saturdays .
hello yelpers good recommendation for a mexican restaurant in philly thanks we had such a delicious meal there tried and love their pollo tamarindo .
no dont do it the food is ok but just ok for these prices i would hope for more the decor is cute but just cannot justify bland flavors overcooked meat etc .
totally agree with shawn s amazing dinner i had with a friend on halloween d i had 2 drinks diablo the devil and vampiro vampire becuase of the spirit of the holiday d .
food was average and the service was unbelievably bad the bloody mary was a nice treat although still doesnt live up to the hype .
yummm really fresh authentic mexican food and its a bonus that the restaurant itself is well decorated and extremely friendly service we just happened to be walking by and decided to stop in no complaints loved it .
went for dinner service the worst the owner is rude and clueless wont go back food fair at best .
love this place ive been back to this place a few times and each time are happy we go if you like food with a kick and favor recommend trying this resturant even there nachos are homemade and every appetizer we have tried on the menu .
went here for dinner food was awful had better food from chefboyardee service was awful will not return nor reccomend .
really enjoyed our meal here the service was terrific and its adorable although crowded the food though we thought was just very good not excellent the 26 rating on zagats is insane .
the food is always good best local jamaican food not a good idea to eat there a lot of hanging out at night and they have almost no room .
one of the most authentic mexican places in the city i get take out lunch from them several times a week the chicken soup is to die for and the enfrijolados are amazing .
typical burgers and shakes i go because its in my town and close to home nothing special aside from the sopranos notoriety .
we enjoyed our first dining experience there the food is healthy affordable and served by helpful friendly staff we shall return .
it appears that getting a plug from a major tv show creates the opportunity for a little neighborhood restuarantdiner to charge ridiculous prices for small portions of mediocre food perhaps if youre part of the family theyll do right by you .
i guess its pretty good .
blech .
giving it 4 stars but its really 3 5 for the food or server pushed it to a 4 she was excellent explained the dishes asked what we like and made additional recommendations and was patient not sure if this will make our rotation but it was nice .
nothing special definitely not worth the 40minute wait to be seated its also very small and loud .
without question the best and freshest thai for many miles around great staff and friendly owner .
i dont know what all the hype is about soba noodles i had the chicken burdock dip soba it was mehhh didnt finish it the soup tasted too strong and the flavors didnt work for me the green tea ice cream was delish tho .
green curry with coconut milk chicken and veg was sooo good my husbands pad thai was delicious too service was prompt and attentive decor cool and quiet prices so reasonable at 1223pm thursday almost every table is full this is our new thai place love it .
not even remotely as good as the original one on delancey they dont even have the same menu why stick with the good stuff people my food was poorly seasoned watered down even the intimate lightly dimmed atmosphere of cocorondelancey turned into a fast foodlike place .
delicious food friendly service and an overall nice place to eat in this town its a great addition .
the delicious grits were changed for grit sticks which kind of ruined the dish boo to that choice my husband had a sandwich which was not so good makes me wonder whats going on in the kitchen bc the last experience was so good .
beautiful and clean restaurant the service was amazing i chose the bbq shrimp special and loved it if we are ever in the area again i would absolutely come back .
first they served the skirt steak totally burned on bottom and tried to conceal it by sauces i could taste it they replaced with a simple pizza which was so bland cant come back again .
very tasty great menu options nice decor food came out super fast but service was not the most attentive appetizers entrees came out all at once vegetarian duck was phenom peking duck was also reported to be excellent will definetely be back byob .
called twice for delivery and its the wrong number not the correct info not a restaurant .
big selection of thai dishes so far i have been happy with all dishes excellent service nice addition to the area .
great views but unfortunately this low rent place tries to capitalized on tourist and newnew yorkers paid 20 buck to watch fireworks on a flat screen .
finally a good thai restaurant in princeton area came here 3 days after it opened ambiance is a modern and clean look which i liked service we had was decent i felt the thai food we had was on par with thai kitchen .
the owner of this place abuse their guard dog the dog is left outside at nights even during snow storm categorically refuse to come here until this is resolved .
fantastic food including kabobs and gyros and a terrific lunch special for 7 95 very small place and super casual quick friendly service and delectable sides like cauliflower sabzi yum .
unfortunately time after time ive encountered rude female counter staff here ok bagel if you must .
the food here is delicious i definitely recommend it to anyone in this area this is definitely not the last time i will be eating here .
just went there now cheap lowquality ingredients flavorless bagels compared to other local bagels like brueggers slow grouchy service low quality espresso in my latte and to top it off the bagel tasted stale like it sat there since yesterday terrible .
both the kabobs and gyros are very good i havent eaten but only take out the food is delicious .
bagels are good but the service feels cold the sandwiches are really good and the service staff is so so .
place is awesome gyros are top notch homemade sauces succulent meats took my boys here and sat at the counter people working here are cool you can tell they care about what they are doing and know how to do it well .
i ordered a pizza for delivery an when i opened the door the woman smelt like cigarettes i almost didnt take the pizza but overall great pizza .
food is great and the staff are extremely friendly i will definitely be a repeat customer .
this place is overly priced and overall not so good the owner or manager with the blonde hair was not a very friendly waitress if you want to leave hungry then come here .
yum great homemade food from friendly people you cant ask for more great naan and hummus .
i went here a few nights ago there was one waiter for all the tables and he was dressed shabby and messy the food was awful and absolutely not worth the price tag .
excellent food and service a new regular spot for us we had chicken kabob and chicken gyro both great .
how to ruin a delicious dinner and intimate setting with music that rattles your fillings .
generous portions for lunch seared cauliflower was fried not seared place was clean no gluten free options nor whole wheat available mixed gyro was spicy and tasty chicken seekh kabob was ground chicken not whole chicken .
overhyped besides the cocktails which were amazing the food was not inventive or anything special .
it was the first time that i went there and was very pleasantly surprised the food was excellent and the prices were very reasonable .
granted she has alot of different flavors but they are extremely expensive its like eating a pat of butter and their hours are rediculous owner was rude id go to anyone but sugar .
great food worth going out of your way for fantastic catering take out menu look at all of the other reviews 4 to 5 stars .
gross pretty sure they were serving leftovers from the day or 2 before mushy bland and cash only but no sign especially in a food court with other options not sure how they are still in business food court fail veggies wrice can of soda 7 71 .
i liked it large servings a little expensive for what it is but its different and that makes it good .
ech cough i wasnt happy with wretch i cant even finish i need some tums .
had lunch here today and the food is delicious we had hummus lamb kebab and felafel all fresh extremely flavorful made with care and friendly service will be back often much needed addition to the morrisville food scene .
disgusting after eating moes everyday i decided to try something new at the food court bad idea chicken and broccoli was overcooked mushy and covered in sickeningly sweet sauce paired with lo mein with the cooks hair in it thanks for nothing will never go back .
the food is fresh and the restaurant is pretty clean the service here is much better than the other wendys in wayne on 46 .
there was a hair in my food i complained and the manager acted professionally but still it was not a pleasant experience portions not large enough .
for a fast food place they get 5 stars theyve never screwed up an order for me at the drive through and the food is ready by the time you pull up to the window after paying cant ask for anything else from a drive through window .
this place gave me a bad impression of philly the body guard was beyond rude the place looks filthy and it would not dine here or party here if i were in the philly area must avoid this place yuck .
excellent barbecue place fatty pulled pork was amazing but very fatty of course ribs better than most other bbq places hill country has slightly better brisket place is somewhat big but still crowded .
limited menu for both food and beer mediocre service all around not a great place .
the only thing better than the food and the selection of whiskey is the people who work here the servers bartenders even the owners always around willing to help or at least talk .
dont know what guy was talking about all for tv apparently save your money .
absolutely delicious i ordered the pulled pork bbq sandwich and mac n cheese wasnt a ton of food but certainly enough to fill you up .
the dj and song selection were awesome everything else about this place on a saturday night reminded me why i hate people .
delicious food loved it had dinner here with my brother on my visit to nyc totally would come back .
people seem to like to hang out here and the lounge section is great as a music venue now for the food truly horrible great place for coffee tea or glass of water again the food sucked .
the food is consistent the staff is attentive and its a nice location one of my gotos whether is with my boys or my girl .
went there and wasnt really thrilled it was dead no one was there at all and we felt quite awkward so we actually left had a small appetizer to coat our stomachs before drinking and that was okay but the waitress was a bit rude .
food is delicious cool atmosphere great staff delicious beer go with the pulled pork sandwich with mac on the side .
for the record i def wont be going to the new silk feh .
stopped by randomly while i hung out in downtown brooklyn awesome meaty ribs that were tender and fell off the bone mac and cheese was great and filling outdoor seating so we brought our dog and our waitress isabella made our night with great service .
although this place advertises itself as good for kids it wont allow a stroller with a kid inside .
went there before the arcade fire show on the 22nd they make a very good margarita i had the 14 lb pulled pork and chicken tinga mac awesome good service too even though the place was near full looking forward to a return visit .
youve got to be kidding this was one of the worst restaurants ive ever spent money and time on slow service bad food poor seasoning choice for the four dishes tried by our party and over priced never again .
i think this is my favorite bbq place in the city and ive tried most of them i love their fatty brisket the corn in a cup is my favorite complementary side wash everything down with a shiner bock and i promise youll be satisfied .
schmeh second average dinner in a row not worth it brunch at this place is better .
the pulled pork melts in your mouth and the baked potato was perfect as was the lemonade .
i dont think this place is worth what they charge for coffee my meal was underwhleming and not fully cooked have not returned .
quality barbecue food absolutely worth what you pay for their brisket is probably the best ive had anywhere .
i have been a frequent customer of this establishment and had good experiences there i was very upset to learn about the chefs mistreatment of his staff in this article jezebel com5936392bad… knowing this information i will not be returning to juventino .
fantastic fatty brisket i am a life long lover of bbq and everything i ate here potato salad collard greens big ole salad brisket and beef ribs amazing .
main attraction for us was juventino the man always there on saturday friendly on the ball a neighborhood institution then there was that news report about juventino being sued by employees for sexual harassment and tip problems so then we stopped going .
wow awesome good loved it and totally eat to much but was soooo yummy friends tell me its a great place for brunch too i will have to try that after enjoying the awesome bbq dinner .
it was ok kind of expensive i prefer cubana cafe down the street give me zesty cuban over everything else any day .
just love it not to fond of the sides except the mac cheese cornbread but everything else amazing .
didnt enjoy my meal or my service .
simply great smoked style bbq fatty brisket is a winner cold slaw and brisket tacos also very yummy friendly staff tasty drinks and nice patio outdoor space weather permitting kid friendly and reasonably priced .
this place is terrible dont waste your time money or appetite pizza is better and cafe capri right down the block and bar atmosphere is better at blarney station .
great food some of the best ribs i ever had quick to the table as well friday lunch and place was moderately busy walked right and and say down waitress had my order within minutes highly reccomended .
not impressed at all entire menu is frozen food and bar is limited im not going back and ill stick with the blarney station 2 doors down where the food is good and they treat you well dont waste your time here .
must try the pork ribs amazing they even have all the macaronis from elbow room here .
the food are not bad but will not go back because the following 1 super salty 2 sushi roll doesnt taste fresh 3 well im always suspicious on japaneses restaurant ownedoperated by chinese .
best all around bbq in the city right now you know you found a bbq spot when the chicken which is usually a side thought for many of these place is amazing .
this sushi just isnt fresh it is also too fishy they do have good lunch deals 2 rolls for 8 plus soup and salad but the sushi was not satisfying at all .
great barbecue love their macaroni cheese specialties .
i love their pizza but they can be extremely rude and give a ton of attitude turned off from ordering them ever again .
amazing thanks justin for making the best drinks also thanks for recommending the buffalo chicken mac cheese amazing i would have added a picture but i ate my food to fast .
dont expect much from this place besides a view of the lake .
wow this is the first time im writing a review on yelp solely for the service food was good enough started at the bar great drinks cute blonde bartender moved to table rebecca was amazing and funny brisket was solid def coming back .
we had lobster roll that was tasteless we were astounded the prince edward island mussels were fantastic lobster bisque was only fair we were not at all pleased and told our server without any response we expected a better experience and were disappointed july 21 2013 .
great food great service excellent bourbon selection i cannot wait to go there in the summer and sit outside .
great food and the place is very cute and inviting our waitress was awful from start to finish almost ruined our entire dining experience if we would of let her .
if you want great bbq and a texas two step then come on down their mac n cheese is also incredible great atmosphere great food and great bourbon prices are a little high but you get your moneys worth .
decent seafood joint for families good food very casual nice nook upstairs to grab a beer apps above restaurants con service is seasonal and it shows .
nycs best bbq ive tried almost every spot outside of fette sau morgans tops my list hands down ive been to franklin bbq in austin and this is comparable for sure cant wait to go back and try the pork ribs which they were out of last time .
by far one of the worst restaurants i have eaten at the food was very bland and the drinks were even worse not even worth a try i was very disappointed and the restaurant was packed with people .
cant express how much we love this place our friend ordered the breed rib which lives up to its ginormous name its was truly delicious im waiting to have avas thing here the jerk mac and cheese was amazing as well i think im addicted .
just ok important note unless you specifically tell them to make the food medium spicy it will be bland and flavorless had takeout from them a few timesquality of food really varies they do have a pretty good brunch buffet over the weekend .
it ids really good junk food that isnt greasy it is a better version of an old school diner it serves the under 30 crowed what they want after a few hours at a bar .
expensive unremarkable service and food .
ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh so good go now the end .
i generally found the menu to be too limited and overpriced for the offerings fine dining it is not and it does seem to lack the charm or atmosphere it is attempting to convey if one looks at it with a critical eyetongue .
the best brisket in nyc ive had franklin and ive had morgans now i can gladly die of cardiac arrest only negative is the texas longhorns flag booo .
apparently caseus does not feed their employees whenif they do it is merely a taste of the specials with a supposed dedication to sustainability and satisfaction i find such blatant disregard for their workers nauseating no matter how good the food tastes .
arrived on a busy friday evening with patience and was greeted with friendliness and free chips cheese the pulled meats were tasty as were the sides id probably go back and if it were not so cold outside id go to the elbow room window .
unfortunately poor food though the service is great and the waiters are so friendly .
the other good reviews are true the service is great and the meat melts in your mouth whats odd is how dainty the food is dont believe the roll of brown paper towels on the table you can go here on a first date .
pretty mediocre expected more from the spaetzle with cheese but got a mushy thing with monstrous levels of garlic thats authentic german beer list was good wine was a bit pricey for what you got if youre visiting i would pick someplace else .
went there before the jayz concert last night loved it i had the brisket sandwich and i got collerd greens and sweet tea the service was awesome as well .
drinks are good unfortunately food is not but its a bar and greasy food might be ok after 3 drinks nice atmosphere and the atm did not work .
pork ribs and fatty brisket were the stars the smoky queso appetizer was also fantastic the waitstaff was very friendlyprompt and seemed very knowledgeable re food drinks .
great location nice look but the food was expensive and weird and not in a good way .
loved it juicy brisket and yummy mac n cheese great atmosphere and lay out and very friendly staff nice whiskey and bourbon choices if youre into that hope to visit often .
not a fan just moved here chicken was rubbery kind of an annoying place from the newly graduated to the old local regs will not go back .
closest bbq to texas ive had outside of texas and those beans are the real deal like straight out of the rgv brought me back to a long lost home .
everything here tastes like paper i was so exited to have a naturalvegan food spot in my hood but each of the three times ive eaten there has been a disappointment a soggy over priced tasteless waste .
excellent breakfast burrito and good service if the loaded potato had been same quality it was a kinda small and not hot enough to melt the cheese on it then thered be 5 stars here .
i so wanted to like this place went with my husband for breakfast his grits were dry and the egg was cold and my food wasnt much better the place is cute and the staff are friendly and pleasant too bad .
i cant get enough of that pulled pork sammich also mariel and feleahcia are the coolest definitely check this place out im not biased at all .
great service but the food wasnt as great as i thought i was expecting some good greasy indulgent gastropub delights but they were all dry bland and well boring we got the brussels sprouts loaded waffle fries pastrami dog and an italian sausage .
delicious bbq friendly fun environment ive been a handful of times since they opened and really enjoy the spot the staff is friendly and engaging and fattylean brisket and ribs are awesome reasonable for prices too .
never eat here ever they serve you stock ready made microwave food even the nan bread is what you would pick up from a grocery store .
i was quite surprised the the bbq was great you wont be disappointed there the staff is very welcoming and they make the experience fun i will be going back here .
apparently a three star review leads you to being harassed by numerous restaurant staff creating fake yelp accounts pretty sure thats going to kill my chances of ever returning or recommending this entirely unprofessional place .
i love this place awesome bbq my favorite is the bbq brisket stuffed potato and the mac n cheese service is amazing if you like bourbon they have an insane amount to choose from prices are fantastic too .
food was okay 30 min wait 40 for food server left tables wout taking food orders 2 groups walked out after being seated and not served had high hopes good luck if you choose to try .
went for brunch and we had breakfast burrito collard greens fatty brisket mac and cheese and pancakes everything was delicious and service was good i will definitely be back .
some sort of combination of greasy spoon cafe and sudo mexican on advice of the waitress ordered the steak burrito with salsa verde which they make in house steak was way overdone salsa verde is the easiest thing to make and their interpretation was sad at best .
went here last week for brisket and collards 5 stars for brisket 5 stars for service 2 stars for greens it seems silly to have another bbq place within walking distance of dinosaur but if you dont feel like waiting for two hours this is a good option .
horrible service waiter never asked us what we wanted to drink and never once came back to check on how we were doing that get you no tip sir deff wont ever be coming back here .
stopped in for quick dinner before a show everything our party of 5 had was delicious i was not sure about trying pinto beans and collard greens but they were great we were all happy with this choice and will definately go back .
they really pushing us to order bbq only lots of dish is not available 2 pages staff doesnt know what is on the menu sad .
always delectable friendly atmosphere and great service highly recommend .
totally disagree with most yelpers on this place yes to nice decor and loungy vibe no to the food the sauces were too generic and way too sweet the service was a little spacey as well the typical thai places in the area have better food .
absolutely amazing we went back twice while we were visiting from boston one if the best breakfasts we have had in a very long time .
meh not very memorable the pad see ew beef was way too saucy and too much soy sauce will not be going back again seeing theres so many other options in the neighborhood .
cafe 72 is a good lunch spot with solid food and descent prices i ordered chicken fingers and fries nothing exquisite however the chicken and fries were fresh will be back to get some more lunch in the future .
this restaurant has lots of potential but their staff is awful unfortunate .
so good i ordered the chicken and waffles which were delightful and we got the bananas foster french toast for the table which was also delicious everyone was pleasant and we were served quickly and then not rushed out i highly recommend .
tried to charge us 13 for a side of steamed vegetable then called police when we discussed the bill .
rare combination of amazing food and service a warm and friendly atmosphere that was perfect for the kids sarahs upbeat energy and service was perfect .
came at 1130p website said midnight told us they were closed went to beas which was great .
place has awesome food doesnt belong in ewing though .
slow service .
i appreciate a solid brunch place and cafe 72 is firmly in my solid category very deserving of 4 stars the benedict was spot on and the mrss french toast was delicious good service cozy spot very much worth a return trip minute maid oj though cmon man .
service was subpar not a good selection of sushi rolls on the menu only a handful of appetizers fish was average nothing special and the wait was 1 5 hours for our food even with a reservation unacceptable better off going to asiana house for sure .
wonderful service and great food there are some very unique menu offerings and they always have different specials will definitely be returning .
at best lacking in variety spice etc not surprised few people here forgot some of our order too and waitress corrected and argued with us tsk tsk .
salted caramel french toast yum .
the service was very slow and waited over 45 minutes for 2 sandwiches when the food arrived the lettuce was wilted the cheese was not even close to melted on the sandwich and the overall quality was poor i expected more .
this is my wife and i go to place for breakfast never made it in for lunch or dinner but if it is anything like breakfast it has to be good .
found this place on eatwellguide org while traveling as my husband is a localandorganicfood kind of guy his burger was overcooked and my turkey melt with cranberries was plain weird and very sweet i wouldnt recommend it .
i had the combo 2 eggs two blueberry pancakes and bacon pancakes were excellent wife had tiramisu pancakes with pork roll again pancakes were excellent very good coffee and pleasant service .
way over priced bartenders are horrible .
nice big tasty pancakes liberally filled with choice of fruits n nuts kept us full for rest of the day .
horrible food the worst eggplant parm sandwich i have ever had the displeasure to pass my lips .
excellent tasty fare at relatively cheap prices went for the first time this weekend its now on our go to list .
you have to take a mortgage out to have a few drinks there over priced .
great breakfast place top location in ewing nj .
not very fresh there was mold on our jello totally grossed out i will not be back .
this place is great burgers are awesome by far the best pancakes in the area shrimp and grits was off the hook .
the food is a bit better than your average diner but this is not a diner per se they do not sell milkshakes service was awful besides .
service was terrific food was delicious crab cake benedict was a unique and terrific dish portions way too big though .
where have you gone americana diner with bread in a bag an a la carte menu and overpriced and stale danish sadly this was the consensus of the family enough said nice to have known you .
good lighting great food the breakfast wrap was delicious good blend and balance of cheese eggs and veggies the home fries better than your average not greasy and obviously made from fresh potatoes the veggie omelet was great pancakes were fluffy and delightful .
this place was once great but since theyve become more popular their food selection has gone downhill simply put they have become overrated and i would not recommend much .
finally tried cafe 72 for breakfast after moving to the area a year ago it was delicious great atmosphere too its very deceiving from the outside but the inside is cozy inviting breakfast was delicious i will definitely go back .
not a fan of this place dont like the dinner or lunch breakfast is so and so menu is so blah now prices are higher not worth it .
we had a great family experience at ebas for lunch very kid friendly extremely nice waitstaff too pizza was good rest of the food was ok the kids meals were generous and very good we would definitely return again .
dont let the name fool you this is no diner more like a wannabe french restaurant prices are absurdly high and portions are measly the only thing worth getting is the omelets but even then dont expect a normal portion of home fries not worth going to anymore .
love eating breakfast there i just wish the cream of turkey soup was made everyday its amazing .
muddy over fiddled with fish the quality of which seemed fine if you could taste it nice crowd not again sorry folks .
a fun place for a night out with a group of friends we had dinner one night and came back another for the rooftop lounge a gem itself .
walked in on a sunday no one else was there pretty cool looking inside food was a bit bland service also just ok price was a bit high for food level nothing very special probably wont go back .
great food and drinks love their brunch best coffee ever tried the udon soup yesterday now its all i can think about .
not very good and slow service .
this place was amazing very nice staff lighting was great for a hangover food was great they serve breakfast until 3 and there are sweet hanging seats 5stars the bomb com .
came in based on good reviews here food was ok but the place is cluttered messy uncomfortably cramped and the service was useless got everything wrong couldnt understand a word of what we said first and last visit .
such a cute place i recommend sitting upstairs on the swing service was good staff was very helpful food is always delicious every time i come to philly i come here to eat .
not the cleanest of restaurants food is fair to poor service is passable bathrooms were dirty dark .
came here on a sunday for brunch ambiance was really cool and the place was really spacious got the huevos rancheros and brioche french toast and they were both delicious normal portion sizes and neither dish was extremely heavy i felt comfortably full after this meal .
my wife went with a party of ten one saturday recently the wait for food was long and the place was dirty .
like this place very much it suits for different occasions with family for meal with friends for drinks the fusion style foods are delicious .
tuesday burger night is two hamburger patties and some fries for 10 bucks you can make the same thing at home for cheaper and better we thought it was going to be the tavern double burger sadly disappointed literally nothing on the burger but cheese .
awesome atmosphere so chic and fun and the drinks are amazing try the twizzle .
tried the bluebird for a change clambake for two was raw big disappointment drinks are awesome but food is not ill be going to farmhouse next time .
cute place for breakfast fast service and good food came here on a sunday for brunch at noon and was able to grab a table immediately .
mundane food designed for a 5060s palate .
i just discovered the 3rd floor not too long ago lol loved it i had the brisket bao buns omg i cant wait to go back for more i also enjoyed their cheesesteak egg rolls .
disappointing the service was bad the food mediocre and overpriced and the place kind of grimy we wont be returning .
dinner was excellent staff awesome gluten free options available too seating was very comfortable too i didnt want to leave .
food is so so portions are small and it is definitely overpriced whether it was lunch or dinner we never spent less than 25 per head for a small plate too much considering this place is quite simple and service is very slow .
love the swing chairs and rooftop lounge .
just a generic runt of the mill middle eastern restaurant not worth going out of the way for .
what can i say they never disappoint cheese steak egg rolls korean pork tacos brisket korean short ribs and martinis cool decor attentive service .
good food kafta kabob was very good as was the falafel but the slow service was a serious drawback just getting that first glass of water was tough let alone refills .
great food with decent prices except drinks are kinda expensive have been to continental at least a dozen times and have never been disappointed gotta try the swinging baskets at least once .
the rice was fluffy wellspiced and delicious everything else was pretty blah inside sahara grill is dark and a little dingy the couscous was oily and the pita was cut up and stuffed back into the plastic bag from the supermarket that it came from not impressed .
great mixed drinks and cocktails joe is a great bartender service is friendly prompt and the food is on point .
food was good service was ok atmosphere was poor trans friendly i could aticipate problems but experienced none .
very cool inside great food nice enough service and not too expensive .
dont do it .
i thought it was great kung pao ribs hummus french onion soup dumplings fried green beans steak frites all was yummy yummy and omg dessert .
nasty .
wow what an experience went to sit on the roof but it smelled like smoke went back inside and say on the swing seats so fun lettuce wraps the quinoa and brussel sprouts were amazing tapas style not too expensive and delicious .
wow my son and i became violently ill as well after eating there we were sick within 1 hour of finishing our meal the one thing we had the same of was the duck sauce never go back .
one of my favorite spots great for dates celebrations or even just a night out with family or friends .
i was a regular at sunrise for a few years and enjoyed the food quite a bit unfortunately it only takes a single bad experience to change ones opinion my wife and i became violently ill five hours after takeout ill never go back too bad .
lobster orzo and cheese is very good the gf had a fresh made mohito and enjoyed it we were upstairs and it was a nice evening .
terrible terrible service ended up walking out after more than 20 minutes of waiting to have our drink order taken .
cool place interesting drinks and food options i got breakfast here and loved my omelette funky decor good for groups of 26 .
after we sent our first pitcher of margaritas back for being sickeningly sweet and lacking tequila the second pitcher wasnt much better the food was average at best they need to take a lesson from el vez or el rey in cc will not be going back .
wild child drink is awesome door new drinkers awesome grilled cheese and fries and atmosphere .
we went here for brunch on sunday we sat outside and the weather and atmosphere was great however the food there was subpar at best i ordered a chicken quesadilla and a breakfast burrito for getting drinks it would be good i think .
i love this place diverse menu and great vibe for drinks i like the upstairs patio a lot as well .
smells horibble staff is just as bad went friday night never ever will i go bad staff rude .
deserts were the reason we ended up here and it did not disappoint we ordered 5 deserts banana nutella tart limenocello tiramisu liquid chocolate cake cheesecake angel foodcake they were all delish looking forward to coming back for more deserts .
drinks are always good except the margaritas which are way to sweet mediocre food the service is the absolute worst though .
great atmosphere and nice menu service was good very consistent have been here a number of times and always have a pleasant experience .
the food here really sucks and ive seen roaches the tables are sticky the free chips are meh the frozen margaritas are good and strong though which is why ill give it 2 stars vs 1 star .
food is mostly great ambiance is quite comfortable and the servers are pretty helpful love the spinach ravioli and the octopus did not enjoy the calamari salad much but maybe it was just a bad day i will be back again .
disgusting margarita awful service the food took an hour to come out and by that time i had lost my appetite something that never happens to me this was without a doubt the worst dining experience ive ever had .
a very decent place for a variety of occasions went once for dinner loved the tapas .
relieved to be home from that place slow service average food and unbearably loud environment make for a generous 1 star rating .
went with a group of 12 for a bachelorette party and had the prefixe menu everything was great especially the cheesesteak egg rolls service was quick and friendly and the ambiance is trendy yet casual .
horrible service horrible food greasy bland waste of def a waste of time youll get chips and dip then are expected to wait hours for your meal .
great place for drinks on a saturday night downtown looked like a great place for food as well .
overhyped due to the outdoor seating in spring girls night fly paper trap hipsters aplenty meeting okcupid dates vegan nachos huh for peoplewatching along pashunk avenue you might have fun for real mexican hit the italian market ive had better there .
good steven starr restaurant i usually start with the korean pork tacos which are amazing and then have something boring like a burger but thats only because theyre great the fries are good as well and their happy hour isnt half bad either .
hipsters bar a lots of noise there but the food is not that bad and i was waiting an hour to get beer .
cool as ice from the decor to the hip waitresses and waiters everything is this place is a retro modernism take on alternative reality my suggestion take a seat on one of the stuffed neon colored futuristic animals in the bar area .
really if you want real mexican food you can hit up little mexico on 9th street from passyunk to washington 5 margaritas and every hipster in a 5 block radius from 5pm 7pm it there happy hour you can have your cantina im not that cool .
when in philly you gotta do cheese steak when you gotta do cheese steak you gotta do the continentials cheese steak egg rolls and the decor is way cool too .
eh whatever good margaritas paired with the whitest mexican food this side of taco bell .
great place to go with friends to grab a yummy bite and unique and tasty drinks i loved the ambiance .
went in for a snack bought a pastel and it was disgusting took one bite and tossed it wont come back .
i love the atmosphere and especially the swinging chairs on the second floor you must try lobster mac n cheese sea bass great service .
just like the caption says when i pressed the onestar button eek methinks not terrible service rude cold coffee greasy meals and attitude from the manager when i complained about it not worth it average food overpriced and service with an attitude never again .
saturday brunchlunch for some first timers was a real treat delicious selection of wonderful plates pancakes eggs asian salad omelettes great coffee and drinks and to t it all off a selection of desserts wonderful service and crowd worth a wait if you come when its busy .
nice brunch place the kitchen sink was too much potatoes and after a quarter of the way through it it just tasted like cardboard the steak i heard was exquisite .
ive been here more than any restaurant in the 2 12 years ive lived in the philly area just a fun place to have a good meal and drinks with friends or family .
0 stars dirty and staff and management are less than friendly .
one of my favorite spots in philly and always a solid choice fits casual and upscale vibes french onion soup dumplings will never steer you wrong .
two stars for freshsqueezed orange juice and coffee with soy milk thats about it tofu scramble is cooked in butter unless you ask for it to be vegan .
went just for drinks at roof top lounge drinks were amazing bartender very friendly would recommend .
blah .
went here with family and friends and we had a great experience very cool and hip decor the waitstaff were very attentive the soy glazed pork belly was delightful with the purée yummy of course the martini swerve perfect .
on a bright note the baguette was good .
swinging chairs were fun tapas were delicious drinks and 3 orders of tapas and we were in and out in just over 20 minutes because we were in a hurry .
terrible service worst dining experience ever stay away .
this is just a philly classic the service is always fast and friendly and the food is delicious you cant go wrong with anything from the menu seriously .
mediocre food mediocre service bad cocktails confused decor silly plating kinda surprised that folks rave about this place .
the food is really good the turkey burger with turkey bacon is outstanding i couldnt believe how delicious it was the blondie dessert is absolutely delicious as well definitely a great place for lunch during a work week .
service was non existent waited 30 minutes for drinks at least 45 minutes for food and it wasnt crowded i am not sure our dinner would have come if we didnt ask food was not that great and im being generous we will not go back .
solid spot good food average service weird 50s futuristic atmosphere blt omlette was very good as was the huevos rancheros .
the ambiance was great but the menu was meh if you are in the mood for tapas just go to boqueria i hate when i leave a restaurant feeling like i paid for mediocre food .
love the rooftop bar been twice now great place to take a break from sightseeing in the rittenhouse square area very interesting drink menu like apple cider drink lancaster county harvest the best french onion soup dumplings are excellent .
over rated over priced over soon bad service with arrogant hostess and young inexperience manager across the street from city housing project there is no heat in the back room never again will i visit this place .
simply the service was really good and they have one of the best burgers ive ever eaten blue coat martini was a perfect local touch to a great great lunch .
nice decor 9th ave is far not too many tapas calamari wasnt good flatbread brussel sprouts and patatas bravas were above average pollo was tasty sea bass was nice steak was alright good wine good desert french toast was very nice service slow they had no sangria .
i really really like this place the french onion soup dumplings are fantastic the desserts are pretty good too go with a friend or two and get several small plates to share .
grew up going to librettis what happened flavorless lasagna and chicken piccata .
the mad menlike ambiance and the lobster mac n cheese alone are worth coming back time and again even though the tabbouli is awful really salty and waitresses have a bit of an attitude .
sunday 092814 meal was fabulous but the wait between courses and they werent even crowded .
i really like this place great starr restaurant with an inventive menu attentive staff and great ambiance i go here all the time its a great place to take visitors if youre going there on a date definitely request the hanging chairs upstairs for something fun and different .
totally disappointed made a reservation thru open table when we arrived we were shown to a table in a corner near the bar complete review on facebook page for rouge wont be going there again .
great food service and atmosphere sister suggested this spot for me andy sorors the lobster mac is awesome portions are worth the prices def will go back when i visit again .
cool spot but beware of very rude male bartender asked him for a julep since its derby day and he gave me a dirty look and ignored me .
crab pad thai was very good id order it again .
bizarre i have been going here for years but i guess because the bartenders girlfriend thought i was a challenge to her relationship with him ill have a glass of wine at parc .
went there for a work lunch liked the atmosphere got to try most of the tapas dishes thought the cheesesteak eggrolls were a bit overrated but the quesadillas and salads were very good french onion soup dumplings were disgusting imo lobster mac n cheese was decadent .
i dont know if i ordered the wrong thing but my salad was subpar especially for 15 i ordered the chopped salad and all i could taste was the tinny too vinegary taste of olives thank goodness the bread was excellent and my date shared his delicious fries .
cutest place ever in midtown i love their drinks their rooftop area is nice too great for happy hour specialshanging out after work .
great view and atmosphere food was just meh .
you cant go wrong with their crispy calamari salad its always great and makes for a good brunch with shoestring fries and the fresh fruit .
my review is just for drinks and atmosphere stopped here during the overly crowded spring festival this would be a fantastic spot to people watch and have a light bite on a less crowded day .
the service and ambiance were very nice and the food was delicious i came with 2 other friends and we had the ahi tuna tartare lobster mac n cheese chicken skewers and shrimp tacos they were all amazing definitely coming back .
can someone say douchey this place sucks balls this place looks like its typically frequented by middle aged men wearing ed hardy deep vneck tshirts expect bad service and old people talking about motorcycles and wrinkled tattoos .
awesome upstairs roof indoor lounge liked it a lot good prices friendly people great for after work crowd tried the giant plate of fries it was goodish i dont know philly that well but this seems like a solid joint .
food is terrible but grab a drink and watch the square .
4 overall food service our brunch menu orange juice 3 5 good water tap 3 5 good coffee 3 5 good huevos rancheros 4 very good breakfast potatoes 4 very good note use street parking 7 50 max .
i was very disappointed to see the quality of their croissant it is the worse i ever eaten the plain one has no taste or color the almond one tasted stale they claimed its fresh the cappuccino is nice .
great happy hour .
very surprised by the high ratings ordered the chicken medallion dish and was totally unimpressed bland overpriced food the view was nice but i will not be back .
great food and service just wish i tried the cotton candy and got to sit in a swing chair .
food ok service awful wine selection none and badly stored we tasted virtually all the red wines and they were beyond terrible i have never been so poorly treated and will not return .
chilean sea bass is amazing every time .
my boyfriend got food poisoning from this place last night from a salmon dish i never complain but he got really sick restaurants really need to be more careful with the way they clean and store their seafood .
great hoppin environment with awesome tunes hanging chairs on balcony are very cool hangar steak and chicken tika masala where our favorite dinner dishes and we highly recommend them from california with love .
honestly i rarely order from here and tonight confirmed why this is bottom of the barrel pizza crappy crust lousy ingredients and a shitty product how hard is it to make decent pizza ugh .
love this place from turkey burger to french onion soup dumplings to pork belly i have not been disappointed the desserts are mmmm mmmm good love this place and will continue to come back .
my last order was for a mushroom pizza pie and and an italian stromboli mushrooms were canned versus fresh mushrooms dough was chewy and sauce was bland do yourself a favor and walk a few blocks to angelinos for some real pizza .
went with my bffs we had a great time they complained about portion sizes next time well order off the apps .
the girls that take your order here are very rude and have an attitude id rather order from city view .
looks like a diner outside but inside is super trendy food presentation is good taste is excellent but portion is very small i had to order 3 large plates will definitely go back again .
cheap and greasy for sure this place is a block from my apartment so ive eaten here out of laziness many times the buffalo chicken pizza is a guilty pleasure but i usually pay for it afterwards dont go out of your way to eat here .
lobster mac and cheese is so good we ordered a lot everything looked so good and had to take a lot of it home .
totally average not clean not dirty not good not bad not tasty not yucky just plain meh .
the rooftop bar has a great atmosphere bartenders were friendly and attentive and the bbq chicken quesadilla was delicious .
drove there and was shocked dirty overcrowded expensive and had to tell my 4 year old that she had to wait 3 hours to play laser tag needless to say she left in tears will not be going back .
cant complain about any of the tapas they were wonderful the long waits to be seated and for food are kind of a pain pricey for what youre getting so load up and try several dishes .
worst food ever it was a home cooked badly cooked meal sweet was the worst my daughter felt so nauseous after the meal worst meal ever .
the best thing believe it or not is their korean tacos they are the bomb also the service is great too the rooftop bar is a cool hangout at night .
extremely bad food though der naans n parathas wer gud except fr dat everything we had was really bad i wud say its d worst indian food we ve had .
the atmoshphere here is one of my favorite in the city very unique choices in food and drink definitely a place i like to stop by for at least a drink if i am in the cit .
look i love indian food but this place is consistently disappointing i find their food to be pretty bland frankly its also overpriced making it a pretty bad value i would only consider coming here for the buffet on sunday .
my one of my most favorite starr restaurants the drinks and food are always top notch bring back my tiramisu waffle though i used to come for brunch just for that .
wish i could give zero stars ordered and waited 25 minutes before they told me they had to make what i ordered why bother great mexican food across the street at san loco this place is miserable .
food was great had kung pao ribs chicken skewers and seared ahi tuna all were very tasty and good only downside is that servings were really small for the price of what you pay after ordering one appetizer and 2 classic dishes we were not full at all .
bad 1st experience it took forever to get our order of nachos with steak and when asked the second time found out that they never put in the order this is the first time ive ever asked for a refund and walked away .
food 4 decor 5 ambiance 5 service 4 value 3 5 .
i have tried to order from this place twice but no one answers the phone and the link on the website to order online from seamless says taqueria diana is not currently open on seamless i guess i will never know if the food is any good .
great food drinks and desserts really affordable .
meh overpriced for the soso everything .
fabulous decor prompt service delicious food in reasonable portions ill come here again the next time im in philly .
pathetic food total waste of money very very expensive service was also not good .
good vibe great selection of sharing plates that suit everyones cuisine preference i was a fan of the lamb flatbread beef kebab cheesesteak egg rolls and the tuna tartare .
this place has the honor of being the worst pizza i have ever had frozen store bought pizza is head and shoulders above this there was too much cheese not enough sauce and the cheese it had was bad i couldnt even finish the slice .
so you walk into what appears to be a regular crappy diner and the elevator in the back brings you to a pretty awesome roof deck covered uncovered space make for availability regardless of weather awesome spot .
food was ok but could have been better chicken was dry on my chicken salad i also tried the red stone pizza and that was a little better kind of an olive garden level of experience .
this is one of my favorite spots in the rittenhouse area it is a hip fun hangout especially the rooftop lounge in the summer their cocktails are awesome the food is very good .
perhaps it was my menu choices and the fact that it was a quiet night in late august i dont know but i found the food very greasy and unsavory the ambiance is nice .
the calamari salad is to die for and has been chosen for the show the beat thing i ever ate their entire menu is ingenious .
wouldnt recommend blah crust resembles papa johns and other fast food pizza joints .
great mac and cheese .
the food was okay the service was decent however a few hourss later i was in alot of pain the food made me sick i will not eat here again .
i really like this place their chicken tikka masala is out of the world beats indian restaurants hands down .
went here for breakfastbrunch we both got omelets part of my omelet had raw egg whites and my home fries looked and tasted like they were marinated in oil overnight the toast was good though if you come here i would recommend the toast .
theyre brunch is amazing and affordable and their mixed drinks are wonderful wellmixed and tasty as well ive had the astronaut violet beuregarde and something pink they were all good wonderful interior decor as well lots to choose from here .
do yourself a favor and dont go during busy times the owners refuse to have a wait list and constantly skip people when you call then on it they get really angry i doubt i will be back .
ive been here a few times for a stephen starr restaurant the meals are pretty affordable and there is a lot to choose from and of course continental is known for their fun atmosphere and rooftop bar good place to bring friends who are from out of town .
poor quality staff inattentive place unclean .
the asian chicken salad was huge totally worth the cost the atmosphere was cool trendy and very comfortable but we did have to wait a bit longer than we hoped to place our order .
after going here for many years i had a really disappointing few experiences ownership didnt seem to care i wont be going back bummer .
really cool atmosphere delicious food over all great experiance .
did not honor our reservation were not accommodating after we waited almost an hour for our table after the reservation time clearly not a businessminded establishment and not worth my time .
the drink to get is the astronaut with tang on the rim lobster mac and cheese is a must so good i also like their philly cheese steak egg rolls with a ketchup and srirachi sauce theyre good but i wouldnt say theyre a must have .
stopped here after going to the rockleigh for some wedding planning fries were decent but not typical diner fries the hot chocolate was also subpar .
shared 4 small plates with my girlfriend loved 2 and liked 2 interesting decor definitely worth it to check out .
ok diner food not cheap enough for me though id rather not spend 10 on a cheap diner lunch .
great loungebar located in the rear of the restaurant on the second floor separate side entrance to this bar food is consistentgreat swinging bird chairs is a must many sweet brunch selections nutella on toast stuffed french toast fried bannana fritters highly recommend .
the female server with long dark hair totally talked crap about me in spanish while i was standing right there sorry but this place just aint worth that to the barista in question people understand more than you think they do thanks .
second time back to this place yummy thai tacos and udon soup loved the hawaii 50 cocktail finished with the small but satisfying pineapple upside down dish very cool decor great for groups and after work drinks .
the food was standard no frills the food took a long time to prepare even though the place was empty there is no ventilation in the place so if you want food get it to go .
i really wish they took reservations but the food is always great and and fun place for brunch as long as its not too crowded .
this place is clearly a bar the food and the service sucks the waitress took my money off the table before she gave me my check do not bother humiliating your self the worst i ever visited .
came here to begin a girls night out and it was perfect the tapas style meant we could try a little bit of everything plus we got a pitcher of martinis which was fabulous the atmosphere and decor are awesome ill definitely be going back .
eh not so hot the pizza wasnt so great the sauce was super thick with huge chunks of tomato the garlic knots were bitter ill probably have garlic breath for a year now the hubs likes the sandwiches here but i wont be back for pizza .
one of our favorite places to sit at the bar on the roof have a drink or two and a few small plates the bruschetta is very good as are the french onion soup dumplings service usually pretty solid and drinks usually good .
the size of slices are enormous but sauce is not that good .
keeping it simple and sweet try the cheese steak eggroll and ahi tuna you wont be dissappointed .
how racist can one place be just because we werent asian the racist treatment we received was surprising to the core the waitress was still decent but the hostess was beyond abysmal what a let down .
good food good service only downside was that theyre so quick with bringing food out that we wanted to cancel an order 2 minutes after ordering and they wouldnt let us because it was already being prepared technically not their fault .
soodobu tastes soso and choice for dishes is also insufficient .
i really do love this place interesting drinks good food awesome atmosphere .
food was so so but cashier in this restaurant she was the shittest host ive ever met in ny i wouldnt go to back there because of her and i wouldnt recommend there to any of my friends because of her shitty costumer service worst night ever .
went for drinks only great selection of mixed drinks but still a solid beerwine menu for those not into the mixology .
if u had tried the tofu houses in new jersey dont come too salty not fresh once of a try is enough .
i dont normally like places like this a little too nice for my tastes but they had lagunitas ipa which is always a good sign .
went here once and loved it brought my girlfriend this past week and we both got food poisoning that lasted days positive that the poisoning came from this meal never again .
a bit pricey but always fun .
service 15 discriminate against nonkoreans tried to move us to a smaller table when they werent even busy food 15 insanely salty i ordered the jap chae and could only take 3 bites before i couldnt eat anymore .
we loved this restaurant great food great cocktails and great decorations we would recommend to anyone visiting philly and would eat there again should we visit the city again .
te absolute worst service ive ever had and the sides were disgusting id rather eat cold mcdonalds food than this .
when visit philly i brunch at continental simply the best .
rip off 15 for watery beef tofu stew more expensive than other ktown places poor quality meat poor quality side dishes abrupt waitress .
came back for another brunch this time on a sunday at 1115 or so service was still speedy and without hiccups the eggs benedict i got were cooked just right .
not impressed with the new soondobu did they change chefs or recipe i use to order the beef soondobu mild at the old location and it would still be very flavorful but this time and my two friends agreed the broth was very bland whats going on .
love this place i go here for tapas and drinks recommend the lobster mac and cheese and cheesesteak egg rolls very yummy .
the place looks nice but their foods are way too salty i ended up pouring water in my soup .
really good lobster mac n cheese and continental salad also really great brunch plus the rooftop lounge is awesome .
when you serve a vegetarian beef in what was supposed to be a clearly vegetarian entree you get one star and with a name like tofu house .
another favorite spot in philly great atmosphere food cocktails and people watching blow kisses in the air while youre there i miss that place .
stopped by for lunch buffett today food was cold and stale dosa quality was nothing to talk about sambar and appetizers were ok but rest of the menu was unappetizing overpriced for the quality they provide .
very funky good food great service .
we went there for dinner pros fried idly appetizer was good dosa was not bad cons the service was very slow only 2 waiters on friday night .
service was slow but i loved my tang mimosa and omelet .
my last trip i ordered mixed vegetable curry which was odd big chunks of carrot and squash in a greasy sauce with shortgrained rice i asked for spicy but it was bland the toilet seat was missing .
love this place delicious fun and friendly .
if you like the bar scene featured in jersey shore get siked about this spot .
great place for a long lunch .
the jersey shore comes to west hartford so five stars if you are a lost cast member from the jersey shore .
pretty nice atmosphere nicer than 2nd and market .
its just a bar you would find in hoboken thats why i didnt really like it no style im born and raised in newark and its not an ironbound bar that i grew up loving and still do just an opinion .
very trendy classic steven starr love the rooftop bar which has an indoor and outdoor section can still enjoy in the winter their happy hour is great 6 specialty cocktails are yummy highly recommend the french onion soup dumplings and cheese steak egg rolls .
i was a big fan of figs until recently apparently the owner went to morocco and left chef john in charge of the place this chef was very nasty and inhospitable this is in direct contrast to the warm hospitality that we have always received there .
stopped in after checking in downtown on a bitterly cold day food was delish i would patronize again .
i think i ordered the wrong thing because it looked and was pitiful the service is super friendly and feels like a family operated business which also brings to light how badly trained the servers are they are painfully slow im hungry .
went here for brunch a few weeks ago the brunch was awesome and very reasonably priced if youve always wanted to go to the continental but dont want to spend a lot of money try it for brunch sit in the swing seats they are so much fun .
not my favorite meatball sandwich place not sure why but wasnt the best staff were friendly and my sandwich was prepared fast .
i was back in philly last week and visited the continental 3 times they have great food cool hip atmosphere and a fantastic staff best in all the required catagories love the rooftop bar send you friends youll be a star .
short and simple not very sweet average meatball very expensive and i would never call the staff friendly .
went there for lunch with my wife we got the french onion soup dumplings the vegetarian sandwich and the korean pork tacos each dish was full of flavor decor was nice not too expensive either .
walked in was served with a disgustingly dirty tea pot then a dirty menu then i realised it all was dirty and we just walked out .
recently had dinner there tandoori chicken is excellent the giant pile of fries is interesting but intimidating you cannot leave without trying their homemade sorbet brilliant and the drink that has the licorice garnish twizzle also brilliant .
disgusting bathrooms rude waiters and mediocre food managers need to go to charm school this place needs to be closed down .
big fan of the continental midtown although i only tried the appetizers they were excellent very trendy throw back decor and good service try the roof top sky bar for drinks .
staff was unattentive decor very run down food was good but not great overall not a place to return to stick to take out if you go with this restaurant .
great place to go for lunch or dinner i love the turkey burger lobster mac and cheese and the duck great place to take out of town guests and i love the decor .
noodle chu the noodle house was out of the only kind of noodles i really wanted on top of that the customer service was terrible .
i go to continental for breakfast every time im in philly shoestring fries garden omelet burgers mixed drinks lol i can go on i have a special connection with this place as i went on my first date here .
long wait for a table very few carts coming around very limited selection good shumai pork and shrimp not the greatest experience .
we went for happy hour and i had two glasses of twizzle sour and sweet and then some of the chocoespresso martini both were very good and the warm fireplace was nice to sit around cutesy place .
2 12 this is a tourist spot in my opinion good special or prefixe i wish i could give it a higher rating with how nice the people are here but its truly nothing standout .
4 stars for the twizzle the best drink ive had in philly to date if you like specialty martinis i think this place is definitely worth a shot .
disappointing duck was overlooked and dry very salty dishes steak frites sent back due to temperature very small space do not order blueberry dessert no flavor .
as the 200th person to write a review on this place take a hint and get ur ass over here and try it and dont leave until uve had a cheesesteak eggroll and the bar on the third floor is fcking cool .
had the mango duck the duck was overcooked wild rice was pretty bland my wife got the saffron lobster risotto which was very good service was great more of a place the night we were there the place was packed out with surprisingly loud people in their 40s50s .
i love this place especially the basket chairs the waitress and drinks were great i also love the crab cakes a nice place to go out for a first date .
poor food is awful service is good but food is horrible .
their lunch menu is quite a steal with their continental burger and calamari salad as for dinner the lobster mac and cheese is quite good along with the sea bass as for desserts the blonde bombshell is a must .
the service was good and the restaurant is cozy on a cold day however got the steak frites and it was very dry i had asked for it medium rare and it was medium well done pretty disappointing for a french restaurant thats gotten such high reviews .
considering the decor and cuisine its good value for your money and the staff arent annoyingly stuck up so thats even better basically its a trendy restaurant serving interesting cuisine without the attitude .
horrible service was awefulllll the waitress was the rudest waitress i have ever encountered my mussels didnt taste fresh at all good thing i didnt get food poisoned .
they have cotton candy as a dessert option .
this restaurant makes my tummy sad .
came here only somewhat hungry and had a great experience the food was very wellprepared and the presentation was artful without being too stuffy or formal the hanging cocoon chairs probably were thought through for comfort but didnt get in the way of a great experience .
i ordered a chopped salad which looked and tasted like it couldve been from wendys my wife ordered a chicken parm sandwich which came cold and the cutlets were all breading and so chewy she couldnt even bite through it a true disgrace to all italianamericans .
great design of first 2 floors nice music atmosphere 3rd floor can be reached by elevator in the back takes you to a cool bar area sofas around a small gasfire nice bartenders had a great time philly do knows how to party .
food thats ok at best and waaay too expensive a decent place for lunch not dinner if you have a coupon from groupon or livingsocial .
fun atmosphere and good food the wait staff here have also always been really great i especially like the lobster mac n cheese and the tuna tartare good drinks too .
food and service were not worth the wait .
very swanky very cool the decor and layout of the restaurant is rather unique and the food and service were great for my visit they also make some fantastic drinks although somewhat pricey .
based on the reviews i ordered a takeout margherita pizza last night the reviews were correct about the sauce and cheese being high quality but the crust was way too thick for our taste ill stick to mancinnis or true north in montclair or star tavern in orange .
the continental cheeseburger is glorious it makes other cheeseburgers very angry and jealous the only thing that isnt good about it is that it seems to be only available during brunchlunch the other menu items are satisfactory standard steven starr fare .
horribly food worst service stay away from this place wouldnt sit us down had us waiting for close to an hour for our food .
this place is super cool and the bartenders make it happen check out the outdoor section on the roof the apprizers are big be really to eat my favorite dish is the philly cheese steak egg roll its so good you dont need ketchup .
ive been here a couple of times and their food never seems to stack up their desserts are better than their food the service also sucks if you want a better italian restaurant go to salute or frank anthonys .
fabulous allaround great rooftop bar great food order and share allll the apps theyre all amazing great for groups great service go .
nasty not clean at all staff is very unprofessional prices is slightly higher than normal they dont respect the line .
i heart the chinese chicken salad end of story oh and of course the buzz aldrin martini its orange and made with tangwhat could be better .
dont go here there were magets found in the food and it was all frozen if i could give it 0 stars i would .
i dont go for the food its the rooftop barlounge you come for there is probably no other place in philly with that kind of setting .
i got sick after .
maybe i was confused but the rooftop bar and the 2 level restaurant seem to have separate entrances and are not connected anyway i was here on a friday night at the rooftop bar beautiful upscale crowd will be back when im in town .
mediocre at best cuban sandwich was ho hum with parts of it tasting like plastic yellow rice was also no frills plantains were very good if you eat here order from the daily specials list .
i had the glazed duck and it was small portions but very tastey and delicious my date had some chicken thai dish that was good but not enough chicken the desserts were cute and very flavorful the atmosphere is wirth the experience alone .
this place is gross lady making my sandwich was talking on her cell phone at the same time let me put it nicely i missed two days of work after getting take out from this place .
i think its bullshit that a roof deck on the 4th floor counts as awesome in philly i love the fireplace typical steven starr swank i come here a lot .
horrible experience our party 2 people was waiting for 1h after making a reservation and showing up at the right time and other people came and sat down before us with no reservation i asked homophobes stay away .
love henrys food is always fresh and made on time we order breakfast here pretty regularly only thing is i wish they could deliver best to go breakfast in verona awesome coffee western omelet is great .
what are these tacos for ants .
really really good coffee and fresh food not much else to say besides that definitely the best deli in the area and worth the wait .
entirely and utterly underwhelming .
visiting the city and i found great reviews on pylos it didnt disappoint it was absolutely amazing the food ambience and location were wonderful the appetizers were more than enough for three highly recommended .
poor service from the hostess and bartender the tiny tacos are ok but be prepared to spend .
what a great restaurant and what a great service absolutely fabulous place to be for informal and formal setting food came out quickly warm savory and pleasant presentation i cannot wait to come back again ambiance perfect for friends date or just for the heck of greek food .
there was a 2 hour wait to barrio chino definitely not worth it although the drinks were great i had the tamarind margarita which was tasty but the food wasnt very flavorful i guess id go back for a drink and skip the meal .
greek salad was amazing large chunks of feta lovely dressing beautifully seared calamari and octopus the spanakopita was almost all dough though which is why they lost a star otherwise it was awesome .
ehhhhh place is semibad cooks are cooking with no light on service is subpar decor looks authentic but the food isnt its a hipster hang out and thats about it .
damn this place rocks like crazy we had a killer meal with avgolemeno saganaki and even octopus that rocked it vino was flowing bar is the place to be for seating .
too crowdy very poor service the food is not fresh if you like to wait 30 minutes for some authentic margarita which is actually as good as wherever else then this place is for you and its pricey so make sure you have your cash ready .
great greek food more of an upscale version and fabulous atmosphere reasonably priced for the quality you get and the service is always excellent one of my favorite restaurants in the neighborhood always enjoy it and always consistent .
better food and service can be found nearby unless you really like attitude oh and waiting to get a reserved seat at the bar then stay and wait and wait and wait .
definitely lived up to the reviews try the tower dessert and roasted peppers appetizer great decor and good service too .
we encountered rude service and food that tasted on par with a taco bell on its peak go elsewhere .
again a fabulous meal that never disappointsservice that delights and food that is so delish everytime .
the pizza was edible barely the price was right but i would not go back the pizza tasted old and stale .
absolutely delicious authentic greek food and drink warm attentive service and a very nice ambiance the meatballs are a must the octopus was amazing the retsina is delicious go and take a friend .
overpriced and less than decent food they upcharge 75 for a wrap because the tortillas cost more they will nickel and dime you .
artichoke moussaka is wonderful i love getting a few appetizers to split along with a horiatiki salad to get a nice sampling and keep the price very reasonable .
pretty decent for a quick eat but not really the place to go if youre looking for authentic chinese food .
authentic with a twist i love octopus and i had it several ways here terrific i could have eaten a whole feed bag of the agria horta seasoned salad with feta lemon etc wonderful as was the pistachio covered bass loved it all .
i think over time only the good to great reviews for cafe matisse stay on yelp go to the city spring for a bottle 5 stars really no thanks .
i love this place i know greek tavernas and though this place lacks the old country charm like some of the tavernas in queens its got the goods believe me i loved the lamb and grilled seafood bravo .
this place pretends to be an irish pub but it isnt the food menu as well as execution is pathetic i think i just had the worst cold small reuben in years this place is ok for drinks but keep your expectations low when it comes to food .
this place is amazing the appetizers were delish we had the fried zucchini the octopus and for dinner shirt ribs and seafood pasta the service was awesome food awesome this place is a must eat i totally will be back .
so i ordered the arro blanco con abichula negro ropa vieja everything was bland the shredded steak was watery the only thing that saved it was the plantano gave it a second chance and disappointmented again rather go to sophies less than a mile away .
really great food not typical greek since its more upscales and fusion but really worth every penny honey braised lamb shank was to die for bean mash greek salad highest class fabulous .
rude management food was ok waitress was nice and the host but i really wont be returning .
excellent food and service order the fish of the day and you cant go wrong br dire to reserve especially if you have a large party 4 i have had several dishes here and appetizers which have always been excellent there is something for everyone including vegetarians .
one hour for delivery are you serious worst of all insipid food you tell me i have to wait an hour for great cuban and ill wait but the churrasco tasted like oil what a huge disappointment .
awesome food we especially loved the pepper stuffed with whipped feta amazing great place for a date night .
food was salty and weak drinks the entrance on the corner leads to the bar the restaurant entrance is on the sidewalk the waitstaff was friendly but food wasnt what i expected .
amazing best lamb in nyc quotes my fiancé who is the snobbiest of food snobs out there he loves this place it is worth the wait its best to book a couple days in advance as well the place books up quickly .
tasty food tasty beers nasty service .
always busy cheaper than it should be good wines ask recommendations .
new years party is awful service is so slow theres no dancing and no one is happy about the mixed drinks the ball has not dropped yet and i know i wasted money .
both appetizers and main dishes are amazing love the mingling atmosphere at the communal table never know who youre going to meet manager was really nice and very friendly feels like being home again .
i want to love this place great quiet downtempo townie vibe but every time im in here the bartender is completely checked out from serving the people sitting at the bar and it takes me 10 minutes to get the check or another round .
i love the design and the outputs fish is good too you need to make a reservation before you come waiter are nice but just a bit pricy .
i used to come here and last few times the margarita has decreased its size it gives me the feeling that the business isnt going well or not well managed very disappointed .
loved this place cant wait to go back .
i dont get whats so special about this place it gets absolutely over crowded terrible selection if beers on tap minimal good selection the garden out back is fair if you can find a seat .
fabulous food wine great service beautiful decor without being over the top and reasonably priced now this is a restaurant worth trying in ny .
meh overpriced and unfriendly gotta give it up to the bacon bloody mary though .
i love this place very nice appetizers and always hot and fresh fish lamb chops are also very nice the mood and the interior is also well done .
overrated i guess if you get here early enough where you can get a seat it would be nice but that never seems to happen to me .
the food is my favorite type of food great greek salad and and grilled fish and octopus the greek wines were good and the wait staff was very knowledgable overall a great experience .
this is not a bar it is a vortex of hubris and pretense staff is haughty and the patrons will treat you like a turd rolled in ants if you try to speak to them man or woman .
nice atmosphere good food good service door bitch on the other hand was dumb as a box of rocks .
awful awful service i hate being mistreated by the bartender and a waitress all on the same visit decent burger and good beer list if you can forgive the terrible service .
the best grilled octopus i have ever tried had the brizola as a entree happy with my choice great service amazing wine selection .
wish i could say that i had a good experience here but i would be lying the service was terrible not to mention a hair in my girlfriends pancakes food is pretty average aside from the fried pickles .
that philo honey cinnamon custard amazingness was incredible meatball appetizers were light as air truly amazing lemon chicken soup with orzo was fab only wished the bar included more than wine and beer .
if you like burnt vegetables and waiting 15 minutes for water or napkins look no further the only good thing is the meatloaf and sweet potatoes with cashew sauce if you need to eat healthy come here if theres no where else otherwise stay away .
we had a great time service was great and the food was delicious there were so many things that other guests were having we cant wait to go back and try a few more dishes .
worst 4 person feast ever portions are so small its really only for one person will never order from here again also bad service and the food took so long to be delivered .
after a year came back to this lovely greek restaurant just loving it still great food great wine and great service .
this is only good if you are devoted to the lifestyle sure roasted plain sweet potato is great for roasted plain sweet potato but if you throw on some butter all the sudden its a hell of a lot better than roasted plain sweet potato .
great food great atmosphere been here twice with friends and doesnt disappoint highly recommend the meatballs also had the fish which was super tasty service is great and wine suggestions for the meal .
healthy and delicious can be a hard combo to achieve unfortunately this place was healthy but far from delicious my veg loaf and broccoli raabe were extremely bland for 20 i expected more .
a m a z i n g great ambience fantastic food overordered overate im a fan thank you well be back .
the place is okay the portions are small compared to the prices that are charged when i am charged 24 for a plate of meatloaf with vegetables and potatoes i expect it to be hot not cold and hard .
barely 4 stars in my book been here multiple times food and atmosphere is good if you are craving good greek food i would recommend for a nice dinner dinner for two runs 160 problem i have with this place is that i cant remember a standout dish .
well ive never tried paleo before trying hu kitchen so i guess my review is probably a bit skewed in terms of taste it was quite bland and it was quite pricey although i thought making a wrap out of chickpeas was pretty cool .
one of the best restaurants that i have ever been to highly recommended great lamb dishes .
another place i cant figure out the muffins look like turds the hot coffee served in teeny tiny paper cups is lukewarm maybe its for juice nuts this place in that case concentrate on what they do bestorganic juicing and salads and dont mix in the other grub .
wow wow woooooooowww this place simply rocks folks from greek salad to octopus salad dolmades everything is simply amazing i had the legendary lamb chops and i now know why its the flagship dish highly recommend this place .
confusing disorganized no utensil to scoop sugar for coffee limited food menu just passed by and wanted to come in for a quick breakfast .
went for dinner with my girl friends on saturday evening perfect experience great ambience nice crowd exceptional service and yes food was superb menu has lots of choices for vegetarians would go back again .
way overpriced and somewhat pretentious food for rich humans maybe i give it six months tops .
beautiful place i came here at the suggestion of my sister i brought her a colleague my 6 year old niece and myself what nice folks what delicious food reservations are key and bring your phone in to take pictures .
simple if you love eating healthy and youre a rich ass mofo youll find this place acceptable if youre poor or if you dont mind eating rafiqis youll find this place unacceptable .
get the grilled octopus this was my favorite part of the entire meal .
as a neighbor i want this place to succeed but today i paid 9 for a bowl of mashed sweet potato with literally about two tablespoons of turkeytomatillo i appreciate their good intentions here but if theres no value its hard to justify coming back .
chicken soup shrimp with orzo yum the service spiros was a sweetheart and gave great suggestions was very pleasant at lunch and food came out in a timely fashion and the bread is delicious great place .
terrible service waited 20min to be seated with 2 young children when there was clearly many tables available never offered a childrens menu left due to aggravation the hostess was of absolutely no help .
the poached salmon served over spinachrice pilaf with sundried tomato and olive sauce was simply amazing i enjoyed every bit this restaurant is an excellent date spot very romantic and also has a unique decor .
ridiculously overpriced childrens menu 9 should get you more than a cup of rotini pasta with nothing else included .
always a treat my favorite downtown greek restaurant love the oven baked potatoes avgolemeno soup and moussaka had the organic chicken with vegetables on this visit baklava is on its way .
great desserts horribly slow service dont come here if you have somewhere to be later in the day .
the freshest most delicious greek food i have had apparently the tomatoes are hand picked by the chef each day to ensure the sweetest and greatest greek salad experience the lamb chops were stellar as was the fried zucchini and eggplant definitly go .
the staff is very rude and the food is honestly not worth the price the only reason im giving this two stars is because of the beautiful ambience of the restaurant the decor is lovely .
big fan of their food a bit pricey but you pay for what you get .
mediocre at best if you appreciate good chocolate look elsewhere the pieces of hard chocolate that came with my espresso reminded me of cheap easter candy we got the classic fondue and the chocolate was cold .
a lovely greek restaurant in new york city we came to this restaurant due to the wonderful yelp reviews and we were not disappointed great ambiance good service and delicious food we really enjoyed the artichoke moussaka and the stuffed grape leaves .
reminds me of cheesecake factory with better drinks as this place is focused on chocolate it smells strongly of chocolate and this place is probably 80 women friendly service but slow i wouldnt go again unless forced to my chocolateravenous women friends of mine .
this restaurant is overrated the food here is not bad but not 5 stars between the tables are very small distances so there is no privacy but let me say that the service was very good the waiter was very attentive and nice .
it is difficult to write a review when you dont get seated arrived 10 minutes before reservation time and 30 minutes after reservation time and still not seated suggest you be prepared to wait or find somewhere else to dine .
no need to get apps here the bread they give you as a starter is amazing i should really know what its called but dont at the moment all i remember was the taste as a main i got the braised lamb shank and it was freakin amazing .
unique place smells great loved my hot chocolate but the service was really really bad the food was ok still it was a fun place to check out with the kids wont go back .
great place great food what else is there to say .
typical chain food nothing to write home about the chocolate items are good and the desserts were good .
big menu cool scene great food we mainly ordered apps going to go back prices were very reasonable .
did not meet our expectations the hot chocolate was barely warm and the chocolate itself was missing something also the desserts were expensive for what you got .
beautiful restaurant especially the pots on the ceiling with great food perfect for a date night .
14 tiramisu was not worth it for that amount of money i expect mindblowing deliciousness save your money .
grilled scallops appetizer was bomb light delicious flavor the mousaka was also very flavorful and had almost a delightful layering look the decor was modern with pots on the ceiling for a nice touch waiter was knowledgable and the atmosphere classy ill go back .
cake was very dry although i was sitting at the counter i had to ask for water three times the product did not meet my expectations i was expecting something great .
pylos is amazing we ordered several apps and entrees and every single dish was beyond incredible cant wait to go back definitely a great dinner option for below 14th street .
horrible expensive loud and bad service the dessert which they are known for was not even good .
best greek restaurant in manhattan will definitely visit again soon .
overpriced hot chocolate and dessert nothing special to me .
grilled octopus nough said .
max brenners in philadelphia is nothing like the max brenners in new york city first the staff was rude and unattentive .
loved this place ordered the grilled octopus grilled whole fish and vegetarian moussaka looking forward to going back .
good food slow service and the place was not crowded went with 2 kids they only had 1 kids menu for the whole place weird nothing to rave about wont go back customer service needs work from everyone not just wait staff .
their grilled octopus was amazing well cooked and rightly tender also along with everyone elses comment definitely order the lamb chops and the lamb shank overall excellent service and great dining experience .
service sucks to the max go to do max brenner a favor by lining his pocket did not feel like leaving a tip but still did 15 as wait staff was apologetic the chocolate tasted okayish nothing to be talked about not going back not worth .
pylos is delicious really tasty greek food so if thats your thing then you should check it out at least once the only down side is that its a little pricey but i believe its worth it high quality food .
i wont go into all the details but the service was slow over an hour to get apps and the food was overpriced 14 for a burger and 4 fries yes 4 .
love octopus is delicious unpretentious and cozy .
overpriced oversweetened overrated .
i whent last night whit my girlfriend the service was very professional and fast the food was amazing we order almost all the cold and hot appetizer and we loved all thanks pylos to make our date soo fantastic cant wait to came back .
i came back for dessert to allow them to redeem themselves overpriced too sweet hard waffle served with a tablespoon of icecream fail .
finally went here after wanting to for years a very very very delicious meal my favorites were the eggplantzuchini appetizer fried lightly served with tzadiki the lamb and the beet salad great wine great ambiance excellent service ill definitely be back here yum .
family went for dinner and the service was really bad we kept having to ask for silverware and water one entree panini was burned and they even forgot to put in one of the entrees it wasnt even busy go for dessert only .
love it once we ate so much here we felt like dying but it was worth it .
the people that call this place the best in the city have no taste buds the steak is dry and old there is 10lbs of cooked steak just sitting there they scoop into a roll not recommended if you want real steak or freshness .
the portion of octopus was very small the side dishes are all al la carte the bronzini and dorado were excellent its definitely a rating .
whole lot of bread very little meat the meat wasnt very seasoned either i was really looking forward to this place as its close and had good reviews unfortunately i was disappointed overall i thought it was bland and just ok .
my greek heaven i have a personal mission to try everything on the menu which is sure not to disappoint enjoy .
better than genos and pats yes but then again genos and pats are trash for the ones looking for the best cheesesteak steves in the northeast is where you want to go .
excellent in every way food atmosphere service etc highly reccommend for great greek food .
they came highly recommended to me but i was not a fan of their cheesesteaks tasted more like steakums to me .
terrific greek place with mouthwatering food one of the best greek restaurants ive been to .
good bread good peppers and good service but we didnt like the steak chopped up like ground beef tony lukes and chinks now known as joes are much better .
really great food and the decor clay pots everywhere is cool .
sorry i dont see it here it was good years ago but they changed its a dated building they do have out side sitting ill give them that steak was gray and to finely chopped no parking there are better places then this .
if you can get in you will enjoy a fabulous meal and great ambiance pylos really did it right my husband and i are regulars the horiatiki salad is a must .
way overrated still better than genos though i got the cheesesteak with peppers and the peppers did not taste fresh at all .
keftedakia was great same with braised lamb shank .
the steaks are chopped up extremely fine and as for the bread well the sandwich is really really soggy out of all the pop cheesesteak places this is my least favorite i think most people like it because it is a well established place to like .
best place on the planet great date night ambiance is incrediblego here .
honestly i was disappointed the meat was dry and there was hardly any cheese boring and not worth the wait or the far drive .
one of the finest restaurants in town true greek cuisine .
the emperor has no clothes .
i highly recommend this place it was a beautiful meal very fast friendly service welcoming decor not too crowded on a sunday morning reasonable prices just a good time okay okay .
very rude staff very rude standoffish and snotty i try to avoid this place .
its one of my favorite greek restaurants in nyc i love the atmosphere quaint and the food is consistently amazing its a great place for a date and equally appropriate to meet friends im obsessed with the octopus definitely check it out if your in the neighborhood .
i ordered delivery and it definitely fell in the ground with no apology not worth it .
it doesnt get much better than this although i enjoyed my lamb shank entree id recommend ordering a bunch of appetizers instead the grilled squid and artichoke lasagna we ordered were amazing the chocolate mousse was great as well if you have any room by then .
not bad pizza but poor customer service they were disorganized and didnt make some of our order until we asked about it i guess we should expect that from a hole in the wall pizza place .
best greek food in nyc the horiatiki is perfect the lamb chops are amazing the seafood pasta with the ouzo sauce is one of the most innovative flavors ive ever had been eating there for years will never stop loving it go there if you can .
no those big puffs of fried dough with powdered sugar on them in the window dont taste any good keep walking .
the greek salad is to die for love this place great service too .
good pizza is hard to find in philly and this is not the place very very avg only if you are very hungry and need fuel to exist .
fantastic place very tasty menu one dish better than the other great for 4 people i recommend sharing dishes to have a real greek experience the whole fish grape leaves kafka and the greek salad are my favorite dishes .
yo zio i ate nothing for a week on the master cleanse when i could have eaten at zios and one hour later viewed the contents of my entire g i tract cheers to you zio for this service to humanity .
lovely dishes and great atmosphere perfect for a summer meal .
this place is such a major disappointment food was terrible service was pleasant but incompetent and slow had a 100 gift certificate our bill was around 50 but didnt bother to wait for the balance of the gift certificate back since we never plan on returning .
shared the lamb shank short ribs and stuffed chicken all were fantastic ambiance was great and they actually have the perfect level of service this place is a win all around good on you guys keep it the same .
service was fine but food was lacking pasta was over cooked salty and nothing special .
great .
if you live in new york you better avoid this restaurant because for the same money you can find much better food service is soso interior design is attractive which actually seduced us to come .
glorious greek grub i hated lamb until pylos ive never heard of moussaka until pylos see a pattern here .
due to the overwhelming stars and reviews we stopped in for dinner snubbed by the host we left and wandered across the street to la bella vita the food wine wait staff and owner were fantastic pass on benito go to perfection .
this greek restaurant is amazing we had the saganaki lamb chops and lamb shank everything was so delicious i also loved the clay pots hanging from the ceiling this is one of my favorite restaurants including greek and nongreek .
monday night 2 pre fix dinner for25ea appetizer spaghetti was small just ok then lastly should cant second came 2 the steak which was just a thin dead slap off meat 2 the fish was under cooked totally not worth 60 .
absolutely a solid meal i had the octopus squid and meatballs and enjoyed every bite my waitress and hostess were lovely and made lunch seem like it was very well spent nice place to take a date or gather with a close friend .
ordinary cheesy little italy joint unspectacular food .
amazing greek food wonderful service lovely environmentatmosphere and reasonably priced .
this place is absolutely disgusting im not a picky eater at all and i was so disappointed how can you mess up pasta they sure can dont waste your time .
pylos continues to amaze and delight we stuck to our favorites of lamb shank and braised short ribs and left with the most sublime feelings .
4 stars is crazy understaffed sandwiches with 2 slices of meat for 12 and way loud music i wont be back youve been warned .
been here a few times and was never disappointed the baby lamb chops with eggplants is really good as well as the ribs i love the atmosphere as well especially the clay pot ceiling great food and decor service is wonderful too .
if you like a beautiful looking place with martinis the size of a shot glass and bad service then this is your spot i will not be back .
not as good nor as cheap nor as plentiful as taverna kylcades in astoria but it is pretty good for manhattan with a nice classy romantic atmosphere to boot .
i came here for a birthday party on a friday night while i liked the space drink menu and games the waitress was unpleasant maybe she was overwhelmed but thats not an excuse after a few rounds we went next door to whiskey brooklyn .
everytime i go the food decor ambience and service are all 5star the wine is alright but everything else allows for the 5 stars totally cool for a group too yum .
the sound system here in the basement is the worst if it werent for that this place would have 5 stars from me .
amazing little neighborhood restaurant in an interesting neighborhood cozy but not cramped personal service and the best greek food i have ever eaten will definitely be back .
you know great place to kick back with a small group on a thursday night but they rejected my yelp coupon told me it wasnt a legit coupon and they didnt have a deal with yelp disappointing .
great service tasty food and cool spot recommended .
little bar good atmosphere i like the basement that is pretty cool and has some good electro from time to time .
very good option for greek food the veggie mousaka and greek salad are very good i would recommend this place the restaurant is a bit crowded and you usually need a reservation a good option if you are in the east village .
nice place good atmosphere beer selection cocktails and food truly abysmal service we were ignored by waitress order forgotten .
amazing excellent service best greek food nice atmosphere and decor .
great location however coffee not good tastes like something you get at 7 eleven and very expensive i am a small world customer and wanted to give another local store a chance sorry will not be back .
excellent service in a very nice setting and the food is quite good we had lunch here and the ingredients that were chosen were tasty and fresh greek salad and tzatziki were to die for .
i ordered one cup of hot chocolate cost 5 08 but personally i am not really satisfied a bit overpriced for its quality the taste of chocolate is not strong enough just like ovomaltine however i like ovomaltine even than this drink here .
love the octopus lamb shank everything is very very good and great service little pricy for the neighborhood but worth it .
soso coffee especially for what you pay didnt have one but the pastries look great .
great place would absolutely go back love it .
the food was completely insipid and had no flavor at all we were surprised the place had so many good reviews since we had 3 small plates and none of them tasted good wine selection was okay and service wasnt bad but the food was awful .
best greek restaurant that i have been to amazing waitstaff food decor wine everything i went here once with fiance and bestfriend cant wait to go back .
this place has been closed for quite a while .
great food good wine list the most original greek food ive found in nyc i cant say anything bad about pylos and ive said a lot bad about other nyc restos .
this place blows the least extensive menu i have ever seen over priced no pizza no burgers no spaghetti this place has clean restrooms good place to do a dump and run .
very cute place with great food and outstanding service we had fish meat octupus and desserts everything was delicious and authentic make reservations way in advance .
sat outside for brunch they were able to seat us right away service was great found a hair in my food and sent it back manager came over to apologize which was appreciated food was very average dont think well come back .
beautiful restaurant delicious upscale greek food first class service great place for a date .
good service cocktails subpar grubs lacking flavor across the board we tried a little bit of everything not one dish was good .
so goood small cute place ordered the artichokes for appetizer and the rack of lamb for entree both were amazingggg even the complimentary bread they give you in the beginning with the hummus was delicious .
dont know why the yelpers were so off on this one the menu looks great but the execution is schoolcafeteria worthy at best overcooked meat literally swimming in oily water completely uninspired .
great greek food very good wines and excellent service .
irritatingly stingy pours of 16 cabernet sauvignon by the glass was a ripoff and left a sour taste in my mouth the food was average i wont be back .
i love this place .
i had brunch here and i was expecting so much more from the recommendations and reputation i had the huevos rancheros and my gf had the scrambled eggs with smoked trout neither of us finished our meals never coming back .
nice decor friendly wait staff dessert was great .
we expected more it was just ok nothing special we had a party of three in a saturday late morning waited 35 minutes cookshop is overpriced .
overall food was pretty good the grilled octopus was the highlight for us but the steamed whole bass was a bit overcooked will come back again when im in the mood for rustic greek food .
sorry not a big fan i dont know i mean how do they charge so much food and have a bunch of hispanic guy working as their linecooks .
as good as they say get the chicken it is like heaven on earth the salads are authentic just cut vegetables with light olive oilvinaigrette type dressing and so are the spices on the entrees best greek restaurant ive been to outside of greece .
decent burger however the bun fell apart the first time i picked the burger up so therefore a 2 rating .
love that greek restaurant amazing tarama grilled octopus and traditional greek salad my favorite greek place in ny .
the chef salad was very disappointing service was good .
great food and service .
i thought the food was hit or miss enjoyed our appetizer chicken liver pate on toast but thought our lamb and halibut entrees were mediocre fun casual lively atmosphere though .
delicious and just so charming this place has it all great wines and service only elevate the exquisite food the romantic vibe and appetizing aromas set the scene for a great meal it only gets better after you sit down and begin enjoying whats on the menu .
cookshop joel hough from the 2008 wine food festival white pheasant bratwurst with new crop apple sauerkraut and brown ale mustard you get a chance to showcase your talent and served um a glorified hot dog yeah .
the food was amazing grilled shrimp salad and lamb shank were delicious the bestest were the apetizers incredible tatziki sp and the grilled 3 greek cheese go there i loved it .
the food here is good and i love the design of the dining room and the open kitchen area however it can get a little noisy and the service is a bit haphazard .
one of my favorite restaurants in the east village love the atmosphere great value solid menu all around tough to get in sometimes but they usually have space at the counter in the back .
this is the second time i was there the food is good but not for the price they were not very friendly the last time and this time they were the same i will not be going back and would not recommend this place to anyone .
good food i went a little late with my wife so most of the seafood and chicken options had run out but the food was very good .
in short a lot of money for mediocre food the fried zucchini wasnt very good we should have sent it back the salmon that i had was a childs portion for 30 it wasnt good tasted greasy needless to say we wont be back .
love this place one of my favorite greek restaurants outside of astoria .
wanted some authentic kabob got some mix of cultures place needs an identity or what i thought it was going to be it wasnt very over priced for what we got not kid friendly it was clean and upscale looking but the food was blah .
great place love the ambiance the clay pot ceiling is definitely an original touch and makes you feel transported to a greek isle the food was beautifully presented and delish .
mediocre food and anoyingly lound music .
wonderful decor excellent food at reasonable prices definitely worth returning to .
everything is burnt i always try and take another try because there was one day one loaf ages ago that wasnt burned and tasted good but since then bread scones you name it black and bitter on the bottom .
fantastic foods and service the lamb and desserts are wonderful .
why is there no seating .
best greek in nyc .
i didnt love the grits they were lukewarm the toppings cold the pesto sauce overpowering the price overwhelming .
the lamb shank was excellent the service was wonderful and the atmosphere warm and inviting very cozy everybody in our party of six agreed we would love to return for an encore .
pizza was burnt this place is overrated dont believe the yelp reviews over priced everything from the beers food dessert waiter was chill that was the only good thing never again .
very good just too expensive .
although this place is delicious its incredibly overpriced especially for the small portions you receive i went here with my bf for his birthday during happy hour and we still managed to spend over 100 and we were still hungry complete bummer .
my friend and i met here for drinks and apps the other day it was wonderful the prices are very reasonable and the food and wine are delicious .
over priced two scallops 11 pizza burned on rim and soft undercooked in center very small meal portions which are over priced never again .
im big on atmosphere and this place is just beautiful its pretty small for a restaurant but really cozy and well decorated the food is authentic and delicious too i highly recommend coming here on a date .
went for dinner with friends the food was only soso portion sizes are perfect for an additional meal about an hour after you leave here nothing special not even the service with an attitude .
i loved this place incredibly authentic food utterly delicious and a great atmosphere .
food is ok but they take for ever had to walk out without my lunch after waiting a half an hour for my sandwich .
great neighborhood restaurant the food is as delicious as the romantic yet unique atmosphere in a city with a million restaurants this is a local spot ive already returned to .
this place sucks they advertise their wattamelon loaf ice cream but once you are seated they inform you its carry out only the waitress wiped the seats and then the table with a dirty rag it takes forever to be waited on go somewhere else what a disappointment .
one of nycs better greek restaurants with an east village downtown vibe octopus greek salad and fish dishes are excellent usually crowded so make a reservation .
the service here absolutely sucks i was seated then waited 20 minutes for service and no one came by we left without eating the place is pretty dirty .
it was good i would go back and recommend it .
slow service good ice cream .
great great great the food was superb the hostess a doll the waiter on top of it and the management was so kind love it recommend it will return .
food was horrible when i went the pancakes werent even good .
great atmosphere great prices delicious food and friendly staff ive had the cheese appetizer greek salad chicken entree and the towering pastry they were all spectacular .
parking is lame poor service the waitress are kind of rude but the food is really good i try to avoid this ihop .
food was delicious especially the dessert phyllo stuffed with custard with honey on top .
unfortunately not a pleasant experience for many years now i try to avoid this ihop as service is very slow i have been seated for close to 20 minutes before they even approach for drinks order .
so so good loved everything from the fresh warm pita to the octopus jumbo shrimp and the best greek salad ever .
this place is so dirty its unbelievable a portapotty is probably cleaner than this entire establishment utensils are horrible place needs to be updated asap floors are disgusting service takes forever .
great food and atmosphere would have to go a second time and try another plate to give it a 5th star .
sandwich theory is a definite skip mediocre food and in a bind i wanted a egg sandwich to go quick right nope 20 minutes to fry an egg and put on bread .
i just came back from this place and had to immediately submit a review excellent simply put the food service and atmosphere was impeccable i highly recommend this place make sure you try the gigantes giant beans appetizer .
food was good but my poor husband had gotten really ill after eating here maybe not related but seemed like food poisoning would never eat there again .
delicious authentic greek food in a rustic setting food is on the pricey side compared to many of my favorite ev spots but that doesnt mean that its not worth it a great date spot .
ive been waiting for my delivery for almost 2 hours what a bummer im starving and the folks at the restaurant seem totally confused id love to review the food but it never arrived food just arrived ice cold grrrrrrr .
great food the flavors immediately took me back to the food i enjoyed very much in greece not too many vegetarian options but a few nice appetizers plus the huge complimentary bread and dip helped tip make reservations .
food was good but service was subpar when we were seated the cutlery hadnt been washed and our server asked repeatedly if we were ready for the check while we were still clearly eating there are a ton of other great places in that neighborhood .
amazing and not like it says here you can eat well for if you want .
very bad service and personel not kind at all and very snobish not accomodant at all to avoid .
probably the best greek restaurant ive been to the spreads were terrific as was the fish nice space as well the clay potlined ceiling is interesting wo being overbearing and the rest of the restaurant is decorated tastefully overall a relaxing atmosphere w tasty food .
pho doesnt take 30 minutes the food was very ok spring rolls and pho but the service was slow and indifferent with the overwhelmed manager as the exception .
sooo soo soooo good the decor service and the food were all great looks as if other reviewers did their part and explained in details why this place has over 200 fantastic reviews ikeep it up pylos .
horrible delivery service it took 1 hr and 20 mins for them to deliver called the restaurant poor customer service and very rude food mediocre very disappointed .
can you say octopus best ever as good as the dinners are i suggest sitting at the bar ordering appetizers savor their bread and dip .
loud music the whole meal lobster pad thai tasted off left a whole lot very disappointing .
i dropped in while in the neighborhood it was a terrific experience the staff recommendations were right on from drinks to dining i had a fantastic appetizer and a wonderful entree i will return anytime i have an opportunity .
they didnt have any concept of spicy the mussels in our tom yum seafood soup was a little too fishy tasting the chicken pad thai which you would think would be a staple dish was rather bland the chicken cashew reminded me of chicken mcnuggets .
yum the food here is good great little plates for sharing and a lovely atmosphere it is a little pricey if youre not coming here on a corporate card but definitely a must try .
the second worst pho i never had in my life .
stunningly good .
service pretty lousy we almost walked out after waiting nearly a full hour for our food food decent but nothing wild i hated my noodle bowl better choices in hells kitchen .
favorite dish pork shank .
i ordered the yang steak medium its pretty horrible i got a well done low quality small pieces steak .
the best patistios ever and the spanokpita was perfectly baked with a creamy spinach filling service and decor was very good too .
returned here again bc my friend was hosting a philippine relief fundraiser same as before but this time meat was better not as overcooked still same 3 pieces of meat brooth was better this time and noodles were good but that doesnt really justify the pho bo tho .
i wasnt too sure what to expect but the food was awesome and atmosphere was great .
some spaces are not meant to be for a restaurant this is one of them way too small inside barely an aisle to walk through from the door to the back the tables are cramped and seating is tight not for me .
had a fantastic dinner at the communal table great wine selections loved the dips pasticcio grilled octopus lemon potatoes .
dirty outdated and dark i didnt stay long enough to order food i couldnt i walked in and was the only person in the restaurant besides the three people working no one said a word to me for five minutes and i got up and left .
great apps and affordable wine great for small parties or a quiet night out for two .
poor quality italian food appetizers no taste what so ever calamari was bland and chewy clam sauce over linguine tasted like canned chewy clams in a bad tasteless marinara sauce nicolas sorry but you need to fire your chef .
hands down best greek restaurant in the city the grilled octopus is awesome thank you .
really not the best italian food i had we ordered 4 different meals and all four were bland as for the fried calamari nothing special i expected more .
had a great dinner here at pylos and love the atmosphere being a vegetarian i had a artichoke vegetarian moussaka delicious also the greek salad was huge and amazing i would go back again and again .
pizza had no flavor very greasy sauce was bland not impressed their square pie is good would not recommend their regular pie .
difficult to get in and those terracotta pots on the ceiling look like might fall but food so good appetizers more interesting than entreesbut isnt that always the case i love the beet napolean thing in particular .
overrated sicilian slices were good but not great garlic bread was greasy sub was ok nothing outstanding service was nonexistent not worth seeking this place out after seeing flattering yelp ratings .
delicious food and great ambiance service was good we ate 5 or 6 small plates and the cheap white wine was refreshing and different definitely get the dareas meatballs and the phyllo pastries yumm .
they are known for their square pie it was tasty nice thick crust otherwise it is a regular run of the mill pizza joint their website is a bit deceiving .
excellent food prompt service very reasonable two thumbs way up .
nothing spectacular too pricey for a regular taste small portions and regular place .
best greek restaurant i have ever been to simply amazing beautiful decor very modern take on greek but still has the traditional greek flavors im greek my favorite dish was the roasted red pepper stuffed with feta cheese you must try this dish i will definitely go back .
i had the rice with chicken and sausage for dinner and empanadas as an appetizer i found the food to be mediocre and bland there was barely any meat with the rice and the empanadas were dry however the service was very good .
pylos is a really special restaurant i have spent time in greece and this place is the real deal .
we had a groupon and a living social tried it two separate times and both had the same results the food was very bland no taste and the skirt steak along with other food was very dry not for me wont be coming back .
appetizers and the lasagna are amazing i always get the three dipping sauces and then add on 34 other items to complement very affordable great decor good drink selection service has always been excellent and ive always been able to get a seat at the communal bar .
i have experienced better and it was way over priced for what it was .
pylos is delicious a great atmosphere and nice service i would have liked to sit at the communal able but didnt know about it until we walked in you absolutely need a reservation the greek salad boring i know was amazing as was the lamb and the octopus .
so so very noisy they should put big parties in the back to reduce noise our appetizers and our main dishes lacked flavor very bland very disappointing .
best greek salad very fresh great service they have clay pots that like the ceiling you really can picture your self in greece short of the honking horns yummmy .
crab cakes are horrible should have know better than to order them but took the chance because i am a crab cake fanatic french fries are frozen and tasteless my companion said the burger was good so the 2 stars are based on the burger review only .
went here last night for dinner and it consistently delivers considering it was labor day weekend and the place was packed for those with reservations that has to be a good sign i ate in the back at the communal table this place does not disappoint .
why do they call themselves a café when coffee isnt listed on their menu more of a pub with overpriced food service was spotty the day i went there though they do have a woodstove .
this place sets the bar for an excellent eat village culinary experience i recently celebrated my birthday here with my family there was somrthing for every one the food is fresh and savory the ambiance is great .
great food and excellent beer selection service is blah be wary of the attitude that some of the wait and bar staff have .
lovely little plates nice wine selection manages to cater too a wellheeled older crowd large groups and wellheeled hipsters simultaneously without being a complete mob scene .
surly service mediocre food good beer we came from seeing a movie at the ritz should have gone to the khyberfood is much better anyway i can see how this place might be acceptable if you live in the neighborhood but it is not a destination .
best greek food i have had in nyc .
average food but im giving them 1 star for their awful service worst delivery service ever unprofessional and uncourteous after they delivered the wrong pizza to me never again .
this restaurant is amazing all i ask you to do is eat the duck the decor is nicely done and succeeds in not making you feel claustrophobic in the small space .
the pizza i got didnt even have sauce on it and im pretty sure the cheese wasnt real each slice is a rip off at 3 50 .
love this place great date place cool environment i always prefer sharing a bunch of apps with people than having to commit to a main they have lots of great small plates and apps to choose from .
during my first week in new haven i ordered pizza from marco polo and it never came even worse i called back after waiting an hour and a half and no one answered the phone i went to sleep angry and starving that night never again .
great greek indulgence beats the offerings of detroits greektown handsdown .
the food here is oaky our meal was bland and not fresh the service was very good there is much much better italian in philly .
my all time favorite when i visit from sf every dish i have had is amazing wait staff are lovely i drool about this place at my desk it gets messy .
mediocre food at best very spotty service by heavily accented ukrainian waiters this is an italian restaurantgo figure very noisy .
i loved the way to restaurant is decorated it makes you feel as if youre somewhere in the greek isles the food is great i enjoyed the moussaka the melted cheese dish and the christos was a perfect ending will definitely try again when im in ny .
terrible experience food sucked service was awful and slow and the heat was off in the middle of winter seriously go to camden to the olive garden .
finally a delicious and affordable greek joint downtown food is always delicious owner christos goes out of his way to have a word at your table beautiful cozy interior not too fancy perfect for the ev .
mediocre food service attitude keep looking crispy oysters hidden in overwhelming batter house roll finished with nasty spices that block any flavor of fish not much flavor to fish come to think of it room temperature sushi isnt high on my list for good japanese .
we had a perfectly wonderful time here the service was great and the food was delicious plus its byob so its inexpensive we will be back .
marginal food bad service rude management will throw away gift certificate and eat elsewhere basically just horrible in every way .
the best bagel place on the planet .
this place is the worst for online orders waited over an hour for my order and i had to canceled since it was taking it so long is you offer a service make it work .
a bit overpriced but honestly so very delicious they have coupons in valpak so look out for them im a new yorker so ive had many of bagels its no h and h but its good they could have better hours .
oh hey you took the vegan shakes off the menu and a few other vegan options too thanks a lot sketch whats that you say you still have a veggie burger on the menu sorry i can get one of those pretty much anywhere smell ya later .
so simple but soooooo delicious im here at least once a week not expensive and always usually pretty busy which is a good sign native new jersian so ive had my fair share of bagels and these are by far my fave .
this place sucks horrible service halfcooked food and rude employees that give you that im in a stuckup vegan food joint attitude avoid the seitan at all costs sweet potato fries are also horrible avoid the hype save your hard earned money .
haiku the service is fast this breakfast wont be my last the pancakes are great cant say the same thing about the bagels very hard stale as can be .
the burger menu decor service and spirit were great but the taste of the burger meat was definitely lacking i ordered the cyclops burger with the aioli sauce and wasabi sauce also the burger was way tooo greasy .
bagel street is consistent in amazing bagels doughy chewy yet still crisp on outside their bacon egg and cheeses will change your life and restore your faith in humanity great prices quick service they just need a frequent flier card .
solid burger not worth the wait seated immediately waited 30 mins just for fries then another 20 minutes for a burger that took me 5 minutes to eat ridiculously slow wait staff as well .
the only thing i miss about living in plainsboro is bagel street grill dont let the long line fool you it goes super fast best bagel and bagel sandwich ive ever had and they are huge coffee is good too and the chicken salad is awesome .
not impressed at all 2 for onions guys stop it .
i come here very often great for breakfast or lunch your meal is going to be tasty no matter what you order friendly staff gets very busy on the weekends always a crowd at peak times my only gripe is it is pricey for what you get .
ok this has gotten ridiculous i discovered a penny at the bottom of the shake cup pretty gross down to 0 stars .
the best bagels that weve had till date in central jersey recommend their onion bagels with veggie cream cheese in particular they make your good mornings great .
saturday 121314 went to the appian way for a work christmas party 36hours later both my wife and i got sick the next morning i called into work and found out 15 other employees got sick im still checking to see about the other 25 employees food poisoning .
good bagel deli good sandwiches little pricey though lunch will cost between 1012 for a sandwich chips and drink .
last three times i dined here they brought out one persons meal after the rest of the table was done eating good food but not worth the aggravation .
good bagels really love their bacon and turkey wraps the ladies behind the counter work at lightening speed to get the orders out theyre really on the ball .
its mediocre pho only 2 items on the menu broth was ok a little salty not much of selection in the meat spring rolls didnt just had shrimp no beef they were ok maybe its considered great in ct but would not make it in atlanta .
quite good sandwiches are good breakfast is good it isnt the best breakfast i have had but it is up there we are frequent visitors to this place and the service is pretty decent .
hotel raved about this place not very impressed service was indifferent my eggplant pasta dish was inedible sent it back no effort to make something i could eat paid and left only having limited time in the city a real wasted opportunity .
best one around a shame they dont open until 630 loaded breakfast sandwiches and much more the very berry waffle looks amazing muffins are good coffee refills for 50 cents one .
driver was super friendly pizza was ok needs more flavor in the sauce also pizza gave whole family diarrhea and heartburn .
everything about this place is awesome ive loved everything ive tried incl bagels sandwiches eggs and pancakes special shoutout to the banana pancakes .
terrible server he double charged for guacamole ignored us most of the meal extremely slow service then changed his tip when our credit card bill came he added 10 to his tip absolute fraud food was ok drinks good but the worst service i have ever experienced .
the onion and asiago bagels are great here the texture is perfect and they go perfectly with the scallion spread the walnut raisin cc is fantastic too try it on a cinnamon raisin bagel the service here is always friendly and the coffee fresh .
very bland ambiance is nice but food is very lacking i would recommend you go across the street to chipotle where food is more flavorful and cheaper .
best bagel this side of the hudson firm crust and doughy inside great variety of the standards and some innovative but not strange flavors favorite order jalapenocheddar bagel with veggie cream cheese .
just okay chorizo and pork belly tacos were not very good meat was chewy not flavorful like the fish tacos and the tamale was pretty good drinks were good but expensive service was friendly and good guac was good but could use a little zing .
best bagel place i havent been in a couple years since i moved but i can still remember their wide selection of bagels and my perfectly toasted bagel with just the right amount of cream cheese great service too the staff were always very friendly .
beware of the manager kevin handling your food he will also bother you while youre trying to enjoy yourself with your friends and breath down your servers neck which will make you very uncomfortable other than that the foods delicious .
great bagels made from scratch its a little small so on sunday and saturday morning it gets really packed ive never been on a week day .
used to be my favorite restaurant in montclair however the service is miserably bad food takes hours to come and its really not worth the wait .
such a great place for breakfast staff is so nice and the food is always good .
food is good but even after redecorating it still feels cold also has a mildew odor waiter was too friendly and bordered on obnoxious too expensive for what they offer in terms of ambiance service and food sorry but i am done with fascino .
i had one of the tastiest cheese pie right here at this joint i still cant forget the taste i will go back and enjoy one more time then write more .
food is not worth for the price the service is terrible and unprofessional we ordered chicken katsu it comes chick teriyaki and we ordered vegetable tempura it didnt come to our table we saw with our own eye we strongly wont recommend anyone visit this restaurant s .
great pizza buffalo chicken pizza is to die for .
my previous review was with five stars while reading other reviews i saw many complains about unfriendly staff today i experiences that waiters where unfriendly slow avoid this place .
a hidden gem very courteous staff with awesome italian food definitely would come again .
the food was ok the service sucks they throw the food like if youre a dog wont be coming back i asked to speak to a manager and was told there wasnt one .
excellent as usual calamari and brooklyn pizza are great beautiful new updates of the restaurant it looks more a restaurant than just a pizzeria but everything comes at a price i heard prices will go up but you pay for quality .
we had the gluten free pizza which was not edible i sent it back to get cooked more barely helped my companion had the regular pizza which he enjoyed .
great pizza love a simple plain cheese pizza eaten fresh at the restaurant best in the area .
seriously bland pizza youd think since they promote a coal fired oven youd get some taste of smoke or something on the other hand my son doesnt like the charred taste of true new haven pizza so he liked it .
joes pizza is our families pizza of choice it is hugely popular with the locals and pretty much packed over the weekend you can read a more complete review on my blog .
pizza ok but at 22 for a small w 2 toppings overpriced for the product ill stick w the usual on wooster st .
i absolutely love matt maries ive gone three times and each time it gets better i have to say my favorite has been the meatball sandwich special bring back the meatballs they were delicious and i cant wait to have them again .
overrated pizza doesnt compare with the other pizza in the new haven area ive got friends who work there so i wont be completely critical but overall was so excited to try it did and was disappointed .
awesome sandwiches served quick and friendly great fresh bread and ingredients italian stallion is my favorite .
its frenchthai not really authentic thai taste so come with less expectations i ordered red curry veggies thai papaya salad and chicken curry puffs overall the food is less flavor and more sweet .
for how much i didnt like the roman cavalry the pieta pastrami i had today was amazing the house made pickles and onions offered a nice balance 23 isnt bad and i bought their groupon so i will definitely be back for many more .
ordered carryout for first time food was pretty good albeit sweet then i found that there was a dead bug in my soup cant be certain but it looks like a roach safe to say i will never eat here again .
amazing breakfast sandwiches and a great option for vegetarians i go there as often as i can and cant wait to hit it up again soonb .
primarily caters to nonindians a little bland a little overexpensive and little inauthentic the samos as were bad but their malai kofta was good so hit or miss .
if you love a good sandwich then you will not be disappointed with this place theyre all about the proper rolls and fresh ingredients the unique ducati dealer keeps me coming back the owners are extremely friendly and you can tell they have a real passion for it .
their chicken biryani was nonsense what they are serving as chicken biryani is chicken curry rice or chicken pulao or something and is no way close to biryani their mixed tandoori grill appetizer was very good the overall price is a bit higher for what they serve .
excellent food clean dining area and great customer service had a really nice simple dinner with my family matt helped make sure each of my four kids was happy very fast service too .
aloo gobi was fairly bland and didnt come with rice naan was so so overall 3 star food but at 4 star prices 2 stars .
my favorite place to come for breakfast lunch or light dinner awesome place delicious sandwiches and terrific staff love it here .
i love brazilian food especially when you explore beyond the popular steakhouses the food here was just average at best ive had much better brazilian food elsewhere in nyc outside of the food the place is not bad the service was fine the place looks nice .
we stumbled across this place using yelp and were more than satisfied with our choice these sandwiches are the best we have ever had the turkey sandwich creation was one of the best mixes of flavors in each and every bite i highly recommend .
worst brazilian place in queens dont waste your time coming here horrible service arrogant servers .
the sandwiches here are great i want to come back and try them all stopped by for lunch with coworkers and everyone loved it the staff is also really friendly and welcoming we will be back .
this place has ok food but terrible service stopped in one sunday afternoon maybe we caught them on an off day but we wont be coming back to see .
great italian bistro feel to this gem of a sandwich shop marie is a wonderful host with helpful hints as you peruse a tantalizing menu of favors she can put on a roll a great place for lunch .
great food but horrible attitude if you enjoy abuse from a seriously bitchy host and waiters then this place is for you .
very good sandwiches real roasted turkey great work .
seemed like a neat place when we arrived the food was o k i guess but the wait service is so bad that it ruined the experience the combination of 12 mixed drinks and the worst waiter ive run into in years not good .
amazing sandwiches that fill you perfectly for lunch vegetarian friendly too and marie is always friendly and great .
nice restaurant good service food was sub par with a nice menu but poor execution leaving skin on the fish gross .
awesome sandwiches and always quick the food quality is exceptional and the flavor is delicious the neighborhood is great and needed this place love it .
i was very disappointed in the quality of the food i ordered crab sticks one night and received dry overcook disgusting breading and when i removed the breading the meat inside was horrible .
just had lunch here for the first time amazing sandwiches great prices friendly staff and fun atmosphere all around great experience cant wait to come back .
if i could give this less stars i would this is my second time ordering food from them the first time was fine but this second time there was a long black hair in the food never again .
their menu is great no way to compare to them to hoagies from a convenience store 9 is a bargain for quality ingredients plus fast custom service fresh bread veggie and meat options plus wonderful staff recommend to anyone .
bad food and even worse service .
i had matt maries for the first time last week for lunch at a conference usually sandwiches for big groups are tasteless and lack variety matt maries sandwiches were delicious as a vegetarian i loved the capri but there were a ton of options .
food and drinks tastes horrible waste of time .
had these guys cater a golf event which went perfectly smoothly the sandwiches were awesome holy moly the capri was cleaned out .
messed up our reservation the chefowner was rude and made no apologies for his mistake slow service pork chop overcooked and chewy bass portion was a joke 1 inch by 2 for 26 dollars go somewhere else .
great food especially the lamb which was phenomenal our server was the owner john and he knew every single one of the drinks i threw at him best restaurant attached to a hotel ive ever been too .
the food was fine but the service wasnt that great the waiter was completely inattentive and was really slow with everything i definitely wont be going back again they did have a nice cocktail menu though .
one of the best hotel restaurants ive been to mediterranean menu features a variety of pasta meats and seafood dishes that are priced right just when you thought a hotel restaurant couldnt be good this one is outstanding .
the food is not very good i took a burger and it was exactly like the ones i buy frozen at the grocery store to cook them in the microwave for 1 5 minute price was fair for the quality house wine was really good .
perfectly cooked burger excellent dressing for the greek salad small family run enviroment .
ive been there a few times the prices are ok but the service really isnt that good awesome fries though i have no problem going there if everyone in my group wanted to go i certainly wont be taking my girlfriend there on a date though .
delicious food got there 10 or so minutes late for our reservation and had to wait at the back the manager kept coming by to talk to us and made us feel very welcome it made the wait go by very fast service was fantastic .
meh food is inconsistent not impressed at all .
run dont walk such a special place service and creativity are on point rivals any wellknown new american restaurant in manhattan menu is curated to include 34 in each category but nothing disappoints please start serving weekend brunch .
went last night the food was especially terrible would highly recommend taking your 72 dollars elsewhere my dog could cook better than they .
the menu was farmto table based with simple descriptions that were expanded upon by our lovely server the dishes however blew us away delicate and modern extremely well balanced beautifully presented and totally delicious a true diamond in the rough .
usually you can get a nice meal at this friendly family restaurant however i was served rancid chicken risotto soup been sick for two days chef agreed it was bad but he should of stopped over the table to apologize instead of singing happy birthday to another table .
very hospitable place food is interesting and well prepared one of the best of the park slope restaurants a tad on the expensive side .
came here with my bosses we are staying manhattan and one boss had heard of this place it way outta the way its not my kind of place food is a little too weird for my tastes .
i cannot believe i got a reservation the day of to this place high end experimental cuisine that tastes amazing for a reasonable price leaves you pining for more pun intended the food is just that good .
eh not impressed the food is not too good compared to the price and the service was really poor my pork was slightly uncooked and the popular nacho was not up to my expectations .
we absolutely loved our meal we traveled from manhattan and thought it was definitely worth the trip while its not cheap we thought the food lived up to its price highlights were the snap peas agnolotti black bass and bread not one dish disappointed we will be back .
have had dinner here several times and the quality and price are overrated it is a great concept but the food just isnt prepared well the meat is undercooked or chewy and not flavorful many of the dishes are great concepts that fall short in execution .
i just heard that the chef left if youve been there since he left what do you think is it still wonderful .
i was very disappointed as this restaurant is a 4 star one on yelp i dont understand why people like it they serve fried dish not even tasty no inventivity i wont go back they lost me sorry .
seriously as good as it gets the food is amazing each dish was honestly delicious worth venturing out of williamsburg without question was lucky to go on a slow night so spent a long time talking about wine which i love to do .
seriously this place is supposed to be good average food and crappy service guy fieri would probably like it .
deliciousness all around and server josh was a star great vibes great atmosphere and great assortment of seasonal delectables .
the food is interesting but ultimately gross .
dinnerblack sea bass udon with uni and a 6minute egg squid with ink romanesco salad with bonito flakes bread with house made butter all dishes wed have again good beer selection and cocktails they charge 6 for the bread but its worth it well be back .
horrible service horrible drinks and the food topped it off by being inedible and yes horrible first time in ct and first time customer thanks for the crappy experience next time im in ct box 63 will not see me ever again .
amazing food amazing peoplewhiskey with truffles and anything they recommend .
had 10am brunch reservations based on sign outside stood outside until 1015 door locked called and women who just returned from vacation stated they open at 11 and she saw us waiting take down the sign and stop taking reservations you cant honor .
was visiting from la and was told by friends i had to check this place out really glad i did super cool spot great friendly staff really interesting menu cool crowd of people just an overall good scene will definitely return on my next trip out to ny .
the drinks here can be nice i like the cucumber somethiingoranother cocktail the food is slightly expensive if you decide to crash here for something to eat music can be good or bad they sometimes bring in people to sing live .
nye tasting menu was interesting and at times magical there was a serious problem with pastry every bread item on the menu was served cold and seemingly stale if corned duck cappellacci sticks around on the menu it would be worth a return trip .
no restaurant that puts scrapple on the menu deserves to be a restaurant .
really good addition to 3rd ave the weight staff were very nice and super helpful the drinks are delicious and the food was exceptional friendly atmosphere and great local food .
took an hour to get our food then barely edible nan curry pizza server was coughing sweating and conveniently wiping on his hands yes the hands he was serving us with yuck will never go back again .
food was very good and the service was great the items i thought were a little over priced nice atmosphere though .
instead of medium well i received well done over cooked meat also the size of a 11 dollar burger is a joke fries were gummy and soaked with oil although i did like the overall vibe im not intending on going back nor recommending this place to anyone .
outside glorious like a diamond in the rough enjoyable beers .
too bad this place looked cute from the outside had kale salad it was hard to eat because entire leaves were on my plate staff was very nice though hope they change the menu a little bit .
originally posted that i wasnt thrilled with the meal the owner contacted me via yelp and that was a really stand up thing to do will give it another try thanks .
though this place is newly opened it is a terrible dinner venue the food portions were tiny and the restaurant was freezing given how popular the bar is and how empty the restaurant is i might pop by for a drink again .
i love this place so beautiful great service and food is delicious and unusual we have been twice and loved the bread with caraway butter the apples in sheep smile yogurt and the pici pasta with duck ragu .
disgusting smothered in grease soggy cardboard bread and the crust was ironically hard as a rock worst pizza ive ever had 711 has better slices .
portions on the smaller side but interesting and tasty mellow i would def go back .
let me start off with this ive lived in the trenton area for over 20 years and almost everyone i know dislikes this place or thinks its mediocre their pizza is a bit too floppy for me not in the top 10 in this area for sure .
the shit .
decided to pick up a sub on the way home from work tonight one slice of meat and one slice of cheese pathetic .
loved it everything was ridiculously fresh and the dishes were complex and interesting my oxtail pasta was incredible though i do wish the portion was a big larger will be back soon for sure .
i got sick after eating here .
we came on a saturday night for takeout we were the only one here everything we ordered was great the steak special was delicious and the chicken scampi is amazing everything is well worth the price we paid for will def come back again .
i decided to go ahead and order here even after reading these feedbacks my order never showed up called and they picked up and dropped the phone on me had to do a charge back to my card dont waste your time here .
great family celebration at palermos iii every said the food was great staff made everyone comfortable we will return .
had ordered pizza and soda for delivery and the pizza was ok i felt gross after had 3 pieces the soda was completely flat a whole 2 liter bottle flat waste of money really .
great tomato pie always ask for it well done it wont disappoint the summer pie vodka rigatoni and eggplant parmesan sandwich are my other go tos the service is always excellent too .
gross my roommate and i ordered from here last night it looked a little off but we ate it anyhow painfully regretting that decision we were both up all night with upset stomachs wasted 20 bucks not happy potential customers beware .
tomato pie thats all you need to know and all you need to order delicious .
this is not mexican food such a disappointment if youre looking for real mexican food just take the drive to new brunswick .
very good tomato pie friendly service .
terrible no other words i cant even imagine where the good reviews are coming from nothing like the one in nutley .
they have the best tomato pie so amazingly good i would avoid the buffalo wings from here though they are probably the smallest wings i have ever seen .
for a saturday night it wasnt very enjoyable crowded disorganized food delivered late and cold this is more a bar with a restaurant rather than a restaurant with a bar .
its official they employ the sweetest nicest quickest most considerate drivers i love this place try them for delivery an impression has been made .
im giving this place 2 stars because they made a very good dirty martini it was the highlight of the night apps were cold steak had no flavor id stop by the bar for a drink but i will definitely not eat here again .
great tomato pie its a must have small parking lot so sometimes you need to get creative parking on the side street its a byob and the service has always been excellent delivery is slow considering how close i live to this place .
super spicy food wasnt exactly what i would call special service was nothing special and the ambience was about as normal as humanly possible .
excellent food .
overpriced hotel food and burnt pizza .
great food awesome service responsive to food allergy requests and they have glutenfree choices .
one more very mediocre italian restaurant both my wife and i felt our food was virtually tasteless from salad to pastas for italian food in this area not worth the time or the money .
great neighborhood pizza place saw the review here and picked up a pie it was good straightup pizza much better than the chains and very friendly service .
sandwiches were decent deserts tasted as though they came from stop shop platters were great we have saved them and used for other events advice spend less on platter delivery and more on food quality .
everything you could asak for in a neighborhood good variety often quite creative and inspired while being consistantly good with the standard italian offerings portions are generous good service byob a nice plus .
this place may taste good but it will give you food poisoning if you have a weak immune system beware if you are ok with some stomach issues the following day then go ahead and enjoy the reasonable prices and tasty food good luck and enjoy .
im a fan the chicken steak brunch was perfection will definitely come back for more .
sad i love this place but the cashier pays more attention to people calling to place orders than the people standing there waiting patiently forever disappointed had to walk out .
food was awesome people were awesome a little bit of a wait to just get us menus was kind of annoying and some pretty cramped quarters for sitting but you forget about all of that once you start eating that awesome food .
i got a chicken kati roll and one of the pieces of chicken was raw thats disgusting i will never be coming back here .
delicious biscuits with solid veggie options we had mushroom gravy collared greens fried green tomatoes and grits all of which were fantastic also dig the spicy jelly and john and co are super sweet and personable .
taste great why give a one star they have an employee there that slacks off near my building for a smoke break and always makes a disturbing crow animal sound and its really loud .
cute and cozy all the goodness of southern cooking with emphasis on biscuits the shrimps and grits is outstanding but everything is pretty darn good all around i was there for dinner but it seems to be a good brunch place too another great spot by the bridge .
its whatever service is terrible they didnt have the bread ready i waited 15 min for a sandwich that took 30 seconds to make .
great choice you wont regret if youre into traditional food just be aware that you will also be surprised with a little twist of new flavors you wouldnt imagine they could be together so delicious jalapeño jello yes it was delicious .
horrible place smell bad food disgusting and found hair in my roll i told the manager about the issue and he said it was coming from me just avoid this place .
been here twice and both times have been great john and his family are kind and attentive the atmosphere is wonderful and the food is fantasic dined on my egg bacon pickled squash and honey biscuit to frank sinatra this morning and it was lovely .
higly dissapointed doesnt live upto the hype average food and small portions shabby interiors and dirty washroom would not recommend or return .
ive been to this place many times john and his wife are fantastic everything is made in house from scratch the biscuits jellies fried chicken everything here is excellent and reasonably priced must try this place .
avoid this place bed bugs and bug infested junk food might be ok but the place is absolutely disgusting if the sitting area itself is that disgusting god knows whats going on in kitchen i will report this for restaurant inspection .
very good biscuits i loved the mushroom gravy nice little place somewhat out of the way great atmosphere great service .
good roll but pathetic service took an hr to get a roll these guys need some competition someone please open another roll joint nearby with better service you surely make good money .
amazing fried chicken biscuits and really good chicken fried steak biscuit sandwiches i suggest the lemonade apple cider heated .
worst customer service ever janiele was the person taking the order no courtesy turning away customers the rolls are great but he killed it for all of us a group of 15 terrible for the business .
an adorable little cafe run by two texans this is the place to go for a biscuit .
chicken kati room was amazing the guy at the cashier was horrible and rude to me not worth it ill take me business elsewhere .
this restaurant was amazing i had the nettie and the fried chickenbaconbuttermilk combo was incredible service was great and so was the pear lemonade .
long lines during lunch hard to get seating cheap prices average food there are better places for a kathi roll than this .
simply put this place is so good the buttermilk biscuit is the best ive ever had my favorite meal is the salad with homemade dill buttermilk dressing and fried chicken on top with a biscuit on the side perfect lunch .
the quality has gone bad paneer was old and had a stomach problem rest of the day .
a sweet southern beauty with so much taste and class the biscuits are divine the style is so reminiscent of the south its quaint and charming go youll love it and chime to your friends about how cute it is .
shame on them for charging 25 cents for chutney .
warm lowkey atmosphere best southern food in the neighborhood came here with a group of 7 girls on a busy friday night and the service was still top notch .
what is all the fuss about the parathas used are frozen the service is horrible the place is dirty the rolls themselves were lacking in flavor i wont be coming back .
the owner john was wonderful to our party we called ahead and they were able to accommodate a large group in a matter of minutes the food was delicious and the service was fantastic we will be back .
too salty .
its been weeks and im still thinking about the warm biscuits with pear jam this place is where i want to be every sunday with a hot coffee eating a great breakfast a truly delicious and unique addition to williamsburg and nyc as a whole .
omg why is this place so dirty when you step to the tables inside theres so much trash on the floors its horrifying i thought the other store in the village although has no place for sitting is atleast not this dirty .
had the nettie chicken and biscuit sandwich the fried chicken was the best ive had in recent memory and the creamy sauce and bacon were delicious looking forward to trying more .
dont ever go here it took them around 35 minutes for making two simple rolls at two different occasions unless you have all the time in the world skip this nasty and rude establishment .
you must go here its delicious you wont regret it decent prices usually good service never a wait a million times better than pies and thighs .
had to wait 30 minutes to get my food not really worth the wait very unfriendly service and unapologetically slow youre better off going to the indian restaurant across the street i wish i had better things to say but have found the experience consistently negative .
great decor the place feels straight out of louisiana or maybe austin given the texas flag the biscuits are awesome and brunch comes with nice touches like freshsqueezed orange juice .
i probably wouldve given these guys four stars but they screwed up all four rolls but whatever i ate tasted delicious hopefully theyll get my order right next time .
ive never ate in only takeout but the place looks adorable the nettie and fried green tomatoes are my favorite but ive had a few other things on the menu and theyve all been delicious quality food and fairly inexpensive .
i hate hindu food but the kati roll is amazing as a drunk snack or just an oily substitute its just damn good and so damn simple egg and meat on a pita bread and yet it tastes so freaking good i love it .
this place is done right such goood foooood not the most options for veggie eaters but what they do have is out of this world give this little gem a try .
food is good and decently priced one owner lady has a very bad attitude but other than that check the place out .
amazing southern hospitality vibes in this s williamsburg joint veganfriendly as they prepared me a large salad and corn on the con my date indulged in 2x biscuit sandwiches and was asking for more the next day recommend .
food is fantastic however the service stinks and i have said this before take out is the way to go .
this place is amazing everyone is super nice and the food is great i got the nettie and it was the most glorious combination of fried chicken bacon and biscuit ive ever eaten .
service was very unpleasant food was great waited over an hour after we sat before our food came though spoke down to us when they brought out the wrong drinks not worth it .
come for the fluffy biscuits stay for the fried green tomatoes and order the picnic platter for the group a cozy friendly place with a great atmosphere .
the food here is good service is good when the owner mr satish is present have been here a couple of times and the servers are very rude when the owner is not in the restaurant especially on sundays .
we loved it chicken pie is a must shrimp and cajun grits was delicious nice atmosphere the owner is a gem .
service is bad veg food tasted ok non veg was bad .
had a really great dinner here with a big group of friends lively music delicious food especially the pesto pasta and the mediterranean mezzes however i ordered delivery a few weeks later and got a very sad version of the pesto pasta ill stick to eating inhouse .
bland expensive i have no idea how ppl like this place .
awesome location atmosphere food and service probably the best burger ive had in years definitely coming back .
food is okay customer service is soooooooooooooooo slow we went on a weeknight and waited about 45 minutes to be served our food .
very cute place with a large selection of mediterranean dishes i had the 12 soup and sandwich for lunch you cant beat that cool place .
worst thai food i have ever had not tasty at all overcooked they took advantage of the fact that it was for take out order and made the order the worst possible you only get 3 shrimps if you order a shrimp pad thai .
artichoke dip is a must try for everyone great atmosphere very friendly staff perfect for a date or a place to relax with girls .
only good for some fried foods not authentic taste and vegetables not fresh try orchid in nutley its the best so far .
as my husband just said when i asked him how many stars im fine with five yummy start to finish with gracious attention from the waiter who let me try the wine before deciding fresh delicious and i would frequent if i lived nearby all good .
purchased the egg cheese biscuit i was shocked on how small it was for 12 dollars could have gone to corner store and got same thing for 2 50 it was nothing spectacular my grits were clumpy and cold .
a great atmosphere great food spicy feta dip and grape leavers were fantastic a bit of a tight squeeze but totally worth it to go and grab dinner .
the service was terrible and the food wasnt very good either the chicken cutlet was good though wont be going back here .
weve been ordering delivery from here at work almost every day the food is amazing and spot on brazino was perfectly seasoned and crisp the potatoes gratin was heavenly their hummus had a nice spicy tartness to it i heartily recommend this place .
food was ok nothing remarkable service was terrible many of the dishes our table ordered were inaccurate or not delivered at all here for lunch with only two other tables but the waiter was really overwhelmed .
absolutely amazing place chefs juan food is delicious staff is very friendly and professional makes you feel like home always want to come back its my home away from home me and my bf love to come here chef always accommodates us so perfectly hes awesome .
mediocre food terrible service the food was extremely slow they never brought our tea they did not check on us when once after we got our food and they did not refill our water we will not be returning .
incredible food had the grilled chicken for lunch only 10 which incredible french fries and bread that was to die for the overall ambiance of balzem is also on point very rustic yet elegant .
the waitress was really stupid she kept telling that we gave the wrong tip but the truth is she forgot we had the bill spilt and she didnt double the tip the beef tongue was pretty good though .
great lunch spot light fare good service recommend if in the mood for an easy going outing .
not vegetarian or take out friendly many things were left out of our food order in the rain storm no condiments no take out noodles im sure there is a logical explanation that would be suitable for the thinking man but just no .
first time i went there seems a nice place reasonable prices and the food was good i surely will go back again .
the king salmon katsu was not filling and my server had no idea how the pumpkin appetizer was prepared he should be fired when you come to a restaurant you expect the server to know the menu .
not only does this place have phenomenal ambiance and decor but the food and service are impeccable one of my new favorite date spots .
pretty bad overall experience service was very slow and inattentive we ordered pork katsu and beef udon soup both dishes were 20 minutes apart greasy and pretty bland to make things worse both my mom and i got sick afterwards would not recommend this place .
excellent evening delicious mediterranean food with comfortable diner friendly staff i would be a regular here if nyc was my home .
i went here today and its closed called the 55th restaurant they said they are doing renovation re open on oct they should put on their website about that .
i popped in at balzem for a quick lunch their ribeye sandwich was great prices for wine and food spot on on a good day i could sit by the terrace just great free wifi a plus .
worst service ever they let us wait for a long time but almost all the tables were empty when we got in the waitress are not even familiar with their food and left us alone for a long time .
great atmosphere with a wine bar type feel service was great and food was also very good make reservations for bigger groups as the place is quite small would definitely return here .
came here for lunch and thought the food wasnt that great i got their lunch set and the food was a bit cold when they served it id rather go to other japanese spots in the area for better meals and better price .
best food music drink selection and atmosphere in soho always the best at balzem thanks guys .
100 overpriced you can get quality sushi in the same area for way less .
nice spot for lunch on a quiet section of mott st good small plates wines by the glass friendly service and a nice atmosphere .
food was so so but i literally had to wave my arms to get someone to get us spoons water etc customer service needs an upgrade .
love this place its very cozy and comfortable reinforced by great service i went with a group and tried a little of everything mediterranean at its best .
so fried .
fabulous restaurant food is delicious and prices are very reasonable i will definitely go back .
the food was mediocre at best an their service horrible at best .
great addition to my neighbourhood welcome balzem delicious food excellent wines and impressive playlists .
this is the first time yelp was wrong i was really looking forward to checking this place out since there were so many good reviews we were a party of 7 and no one liked their food being a katsu place their katsu was not good very disappointing .
came in last week for a late lunch and everything was delicious cant wait to try dinner .
the restaurant is not japanese flavor at all its mixed with indian and mexican flavor i will never go back again just because the food is terrible worst japanese restaurant ever .
well designed interior with a cool vibe the food is delicious and i highly recommend the zucchini cakes perfection the music alone is reason to go well curated playlists for cool downtown dining sit back and enjoy a glass of wine .
lunch at katsuhama after visiting moma i wasnt really impressed with this restaurant there were all these yelp zagat signs which i thought would mean really good food but it was pretty bland .
beautiful interior great food relaxing music 5 service on level with restaurants in the neigbourhood very nice new addition to restaurant mix on mott street definitely will visit again .
ordered sesame chicken here once and my ex and i got horrible food poisoning and almost wound up in the hospital called to complain and they pretended they didnt speak english hung up ha never ate there again .
the suckling pig feast was fantastic and a great value for the price highly recommended as a large formatgroup dining experience .
ambiance is cosey but thats it had the pesto which looked and tasted like it had been slapped up in 2 minutes and the lamb looked and tasted like cheap shredded beef service was crap next .
moderate prices so flavorful ordered the octopus salad kano soi and sirlion dish all great flavors especially the octopus salad it was cooked perfectly with a tangy and spicy taste overall a great dinner will definitely come back here again .
just whatever they say they are italians i dont know about that i didnt like the food at all first and last for a real italian like me .
awesome food love pork jowl khao soi and grilled octopus it is our third visit we are yet to be disappointed with anything .
provided they took me here for dinner so i didnt have to pay this place didnt impress me at all we shared a lot of different tapas but nothing stroke me as delicious i admit it deserves a second chance its not cheap though at all .
so cheap very full order a ton chicken wings noodles fried ricemeat .
dont waste your time just go to amada very underwhelming not worth your time or money all 5 dishes we had were barely mediocre disappointed in the meal .
sizziling pig head different but tasty the cod in banana leaf is outstanding and as always the khao soi rocks .
after all the hype its just not worth it .
ive been back here a few times and i have say that i really like it the service leaves a bit to be desired but the food has been great pk has become one of my favorite neighborhood spots .
stop using truffle oil .
a pleasant surprise for me i really enjoyed the pork belly adobo two orders worth coconut rice and halo halo i liked both noodle dishes as well but i wish the khao soi noodles were soft noodles versus crunchy .
didnt get in closed early .
amazing food you walk in thinking this place might be over rated from just the appearance alone but once the food comes oh my god you will not be dissapointed the dishes are small except for the noodles they are very large .
food was completely ordinary unexceptional and the noise level was deafening .
food is awesome a bit spicier than i expected with the sisig very weak spicy palate but still fantastic as a snobby ueser i wish i could eat there more lets open a spot up here .
its was super fancy but the taste was a bit bland i dont think ill be eagerly waiting to be back .
amazing the food here as divine and the service was spectacular try the pork belly and the noodles and you will be so pleasantly surprised the watermelon spiced cocktail was delicious as well cant go wrong here .
their recent price hike has changed my mind about this place 10 for half a grapefruit 22 for a basic breakfast dish with some eggs time to find another regular bfast bistro .
i went in there expecting really yummy food i did not realize that they played music with explicit words so that was not cool as i had a young girl with me i did like the food their coconut rice is to die for .
nothing special overly rated over priced for greasy ordinary food and ordinary wine also needs a facelift for its tired ambiance .
yes yes yes pig and khao is just quite wonderful they do a very good job in selecting different delicious dishes from the southeast asian menu that make sense together my personal favorites are the sizzling sisig halohalo and young cocunut water w rum .
food was fine but i was physically intimidated by the restroom attendant in the ladies room .
amazing food great ambiance if you sit in the back in the outdoor seating section helpful staff to help us go through the menu especially great for meatpork lovers .
overpriced tourist trap keeps getting worse qualitytaste is lacking .
everything is amazing the coconut rice sisig are my fav kinda sad they replaced brussel sprouts with watermelon on the pork dish and the ribs sauce reminded me off caprisun weirdly fruity other than that this place is awesome .
over rated and over priced super average for the price and pretension that is attached to this place really bad .
their food is so flavorful distinctive in the city love it .
i was not blown away its very crowded the food was good but not great would i return maybe for a drink at the bar .
this is my current favorite restaurant weve eaten here a dozen times in the past year everything is delicious but maybe particularly the shan noodles and grilled pork jowl and theres always a sweet classic hiphop soundtrack playing .
the waitress recommenede steak fritse are you kidding this is just steak and fries same as outback steakhouse and the fries were horrible .
food is absolutely delish but it is very over priced me and friends three of us could have a very nice italian with how much we end up paying but again if you crave for coconut rice here is a good spot .
balthazar restaurant is definitely an experience go there once and thats it ive been there for brunch and it is a very nice and cosy place however the food is not that wow to pay so much .
fancy .
good coffee rude hostess .
creative happy delicious food .
2 pm on a wednesday no one in the place and apparently we californians were not cool enough to merit a table for two .
i cant get over this place itd get 5 stars if it wasnt so expensive when not if you go you have to get the sisig pig and the khao sai service is on point annnnnd so is the cilantro soda .
pricy and just ok i had the steak frites bc of all the hype but it really isnt anything special service is good atmosphere is good as well though .
i love this place such a great local hang out i fell in love with the pork belly will be coming back for that and as well as the mussels the lemongrass broth was so yummy .
dont get it the food is average and the service is unfriendly at best the whole restaurant behaves as though they are doing patrons a favor to serve them food the bread was the only saving grace it was really good .
by the time you finish your meal there will be an entire pigversion of mr potato head in your tummy .
normally i love french restaurants i just expected much more for some reason this place reminds me of a cheesecake factory its very big crowded noisy waiters were in a rush and it was a very impersonal dining experience the food was average nothing stellar or memorable .
creative and delicious food good atmosphere helpful service .
if you are more focused are being spotted at a trendy soho restaurant or in the mood to people watch go to balthazar otherwise save your money and go somewhere else for better french food i e la sirene .
great sizzling sissig and coconut rice make reservations or arrive at 5pm when they open to be seated at the chefs counter which i actually enjoy because the place is small .
this place is great for dinner but dont come for sunday brunch unless youre a vip or they will ignore you the whole time their pancakes are good but not worth the attitude and price .
wow the pork jowl with brussel sprouts is life changing definitely have it loved the coconut rice and the crispy pata too the dorade was interesting looking liked the clams served with it .
went for breakfast highly disappointed because of all the hype it gets the only thing good was the homemade donut i had french toast which had a very weird taste to it it was only ok definitely not worth the price not at all .
meal was yummy but i honestly dont remember much after eating all the halohalo dessert that i should have shared that is worth returning for however i do suggest skipping the chicharron you can pick up a bag of these in any bodega great vibes and tunes .
decent food whats the big deal as for the pastries man do american get them wrong .
had my birthday here loved the backyard in the summer friendly and helpful staff fun to try many new and different dishes and tasty cocktails .
paid 16 for a bread basket thats all i really remember from this place and the long wait .
great food friendly slightly slow service good music loud environment our group of 5 ordered 6 small plates the unanimous top 3 were the sisig sirloin and khao soi eat here you wont be disappointed .
nice ambient mostly tourists always full always packed the food is not tasty .
we went for brunch and found the menu quite innovative and different food was delightfully spicy and very flavorful will definitely try again .
this is my third time for dinner in 15 years i think they may have jumped the shark .
the food is great here i eat here often the music may be a little loud so try the patio if you want a quieter meal ill be back .
service was good food was not did not enjoy the onion soup or the duck special in any way .
always a good sign when place has a small menu you know theyre good at what they do seared pork belly was amazing coconut rice and accompaniments and everything else i saw looked delicious great service and they gladly accommodated food allergies which is super important .
how do you not deliver in nyc .
great brunch experience all the entrees were good with slightly small portions it was just enough for me the unlimited mimosa experience with several options of watermelon orange and lychee was amazing the staff was great and we all really enjoyed our sunday funday there .
food was ehhh service was terrible .
an all around great meal every dish we had was excellent and props to the restaurant for being able to accommodate our large party of 8 service was excellent and you cant beat the 15 unlimited pbr keg in the backyard ill definitely be back .
puney drinks for 12 a pop rushed service nice ambiance .
great service great food interesting ambiance played dmx wu tang etc and asian food which was great the pig face and curry were especially good .
we used to love this place bit its gotten spotty old croissants and stale white bread toast for breakfast really a great classic beginning to falter .
the best sisig in nyc will go back for their halohalo as it is not available last time .
i went there and was expecting a lot more i dont remember anything that good and my steak was really tough i couldnt even cut it seriously .
wow 1st time in and just what i was looking for something new and fresh pork done a bunch of ways and many interesting accoutrements ill be back for sure .
we were going to go here but then we got sidetracked and had pina coladas at this weird spanishmediterrean spot right after we saw tyson beckford pull his motorcycle up onto the sidewalk wtf bigger wtf was his mohawk .
had a great brunch here with some girlfriends the mimosas were excellent but they ran out of lychee half way through our meal which was a little disaplointing i would definitely come back again though because my meal was also very excellent chicharron with watermelon mmmm .
2 5 stars overrated full of dbags who stalk celebrities rude service dont waste your time .
enjoyed everything we had will def be returning .
see and be seen restaurant for tastier more authentic french bistro food go to la bonne soupe in midtown .
delicious comfy adorable backyard seating fantastic waiter warm welcome we loved the chinese sausage salad but really spicy the whole fried fish and the pork belly adobo was my favorite with a side of cocomut rice yum .
hype hype and more hype people are so easily pleased these days just throw in a random celebrity sighting and somehow they think the food is phenomenal eh .
great food and not expensive .
terrible food over rated new york steak should never have made it out of the kitchen the chefowner was there so there is no excuse perhaps they once had good food and are now just riding on their reputation .
sizzling sisig must have will order this one again and again watermelon and pork jowl salad fresh taste for summer garlic rice is great but if you order sizzling sisig plain rice would be the best .
never coming here again totally overrated and overrpriced i came here for breakfast breakfast food should not be that expensive 4 for tea really a tea bag and small cup of hot water lame cafe orlin is a better breakfastbrunch place .
omg delicious we went here with a small group and got everything on the menu each dish was better then last which is hard to pull especially when you arrive hungry and leave stuffed great friendly service .
balthazar was the worst restaurant that ive ever been to the help was absolutly horrible they tried to charge us for two extra meals and the ghetto ass waitress harrassed us because she didnt think we were going to give her a tip they suck .
love their crispy pata and sizzling sisig .
the food was great but the music was terrible its was so crowded i couldnt breathe the atmosphere was horrible i would not recommend anybody to go there the bartender guy was very rude terrible place to go to .
pig and whao big fan .
male bartender with spiked hair is completely rude and unprofessional yelled at my party even though we called two weeks in advance and requested a table and bottles ended up going somewhere else horrible customer service .
we had a great time at pig and khao great service food cant wait to go back .
full of drunk idiots loud expensive and very busy with an understaffed bar and long waiting times for drinks you are insane if you prefer this over the million better late night spots in the area avoid .
really inventive flavours good food and a very relaxed vibe make this a great place for a low key dinner .
hard to find nobody there and not so special korean bar food i dont have much to say about this place the waitressbartender was nice but the drinks were under par maybe i just came on a bad night .
yum get the sizzling sisig delicious .
i think its alright its not really my scene the drinks are fucking expensive as shit plus its mostly asians and not a variety just saying .
this has become our goto place for amazing asian inspired food great flavors solid service and beer tastes soooo much better when you drink it hong kong style .
just had the pork and beef buns its nowhere near momofuku or ippudo but happy hour price of 7 makes it worth it i guess i wish theyd put more meat inside .
been here twice great place leah is super cool and definitely a hard worker glad i can support her sizzling sisig is delicious super rich khao soi is solid lamb ribs are amazing fried fish is really good too def recommend .
a little sad when we went here thought it would be better ok for beers and drinks i suppose but the food was well below par regular stuff but just not that good .
the food was great cool vibes and cheap beers .
changing the menu and painting the walls was not enough to make this place any better than scoreboards the service was bad the food was overpriced and the portions were small as the old saying goes you cant put lipstick on a pig .
oh sizzling sisig how are you so so good spicy delectable fatty and totally fun paired with a most magical bowl of coconut rice the meal is just about the most delightful and delicious thing ever pig face my face yay .
ummmmmm this is a more expensive sarku japan the teriyaki sauce is not the same as fengs two combos and two drinks for 20 i think you are better off next door they have lunch specials bento boxes r much cheaper and more food .
i was there with my fiancé and 3 year old daughter it was the most amazing exotic food that i ever had staff are super friendly love the cocktail drink coconut please get this drink i will be back next week .
bad customer service good food but very pricy for not so much food .
awesome awesome .
oh boy the food was delicious but my boyfriend ended up in the hospital with food poisoning after eating here he had the panini i had the wrap this was the only place we ate at all day .
food was great a nice mix of various asian cuisines and all you can drink deal cant be beat .
the most disgusting food they delivered two meals with disgusting rubbery raw chicken and then would not refund it horrible food horrible staff do not order here they would rather keep my 20 than keep a customer happy awful .
everything was delicious but my favorites were the sizzling sisig and whole fried fish get the coconut rice on the side to savor all the sauce .
this was my second time back and probably my last they have some interesting rolls but the service leaves much to be desired i have high standards for sushi and this place doesnt measure up .
everything was quite good but theres a pig in the restaurants name go with the pork the family secret sauce on the pata gave me pork flashbacks the whole next day reasonably priced and delicious ill definitely be back .
this place has gone way downhill 4 years ago it was pretty good b for hibachi places now no one is even trying the chefs looks tired the waitresses annoyed skip and stay home .
this is the best chinese food restaurant in town and around i love the place is really clean and the food is amazing also their delivery is really really fast i love this place .
overcooked seafood clumsy waiters stale bread seafood pasta was okay will not be returning .
the best chinese restaurants in belleville the food isnt too greasy general tsos chicken is not too spicy seasoned just right service is quick especially when picking up .
the rendang wasnt horrible in flavor but i was disappointed by its quantitycost ratio there was so little of the rendang itself that i thought i had ordered an appetizer at first i wont be retuning .
this my favorite chinese place their beef and broccoli and chicken and broccoli are fantastic the plantains are absolutely delicious this is my go to place for chinese deliciousness .
seriously the worst meal ive had in brooklyn i like a lot of salt but damn that was insanely over the top friendly service and nice spot to relax in wouldnt go back .

i was so excited to find an indonesian restaurant around my area but was very disappointed when i tried the food the service was good but the food was just blah definitely not authentic and very pricey .
all the old photos of princeton alumni are pretty cool saw flotus a few supreme court justices and more very neat beer selection isnt bad .
i was very unimpressed with the food but the service was great the vegetarian options just werent that great i can make better seitan dishes at home and the spring rolls were just okay .
have really enjoyed this restaurant great atmosphere food exceeded my expectations strawberry shortcake was awesome .
the food is tasty and spicy the staff is great good atmosphere too however its super over priced for this area and the relatively small portions served .
enjoyed a fabulous christmas dinner at the bar the salmon duck were both perfectly prepared with delicious sauces we went back a few nights later for drinks jill made a perfect martini .
the hot pot is c really expensive they charged even a little things seriously the sauce for hot pot is 1 50order so disapointed .
heard about amelias restaurante from a peruvian coworker it is traditional peruvian seafood place big portions very fresh and tasty i highly recommend this place .
吃过几次 没有传说中的那么好吃 而且最后一次真是印象差爆了 首先菜不新鲜 冬瓜是酸的 换了菜之后还多算了菜的价钱 一句不好意思都没有说 最后打包四个菜 居然装在了一个盒子里 服务员真是智商有问题！ .
the food was incredibly good and it was in a good street and we had a great peruvian breakfast the service was ok have parking i dont like the decorations looks little bit desorganising ill come back definitely .
greasy chinese food coming from micro oven not really authentic at all .
this place is awesome and as a chilean that is all i am going to say about it haha but seriously it is great food .
used to be my favorite restaurant until i found 2 maggots mixed in with my order of dou miao pea shoots maggots .
we use them as an everyday lunch caterer in our office the food is very good fresh and always on time weve been using them for a little over two years and have no plans to stop .
good except the pastayuck but over priced and on top of that the portions are small for example the cowshuska was 22 for basically 2 oz of steak over eggs really guys really .
this is the best bagel place friendly staff clean great bagels good quality sandwiches delicious coffee too .
got the chicken shawarma lunch special to go ate about half before biting into a slimy almost completely raw piece of chicken wtf guys cook that shit through before you put someone in the hospital .
have been ordering from four js for years the roast beef sandwiches are excellent few issues with getting the orders correct overall very good .
the pita bread was perfect everything else needs a lot of work the service was extremely slow and the food wasnt very good im hoping theyll improve over time .
good food like the lunch special until 3 all combos are a lil cheaper and its for all 7 days if the week no delivery chicken wings beef and chicken and broccoli in garlic sauce have all been good when i have eaten here .
i had a bad experience there i dont want to give all the details too many dont want it to appear to be beating them up i guess it was a bad night one suggestion put some cheese on the pizza thanks .
finally found a place with awesome food fast service thank god not to mention inexpensive .
the worst thai food weve had ever i wouldnt even call it real thai food more like fast food mix of chinese with a couple of leaves thai basil leaves tossed in 50 delivery of garbage thats where it went dont waste your money .
love this place .
ordered the pad thai coconut soup and a peanut chicken dish for take out the pad thai had no spice or taste the coconut didnt taste good enough to stomach so we tossed it im used to good thai and unfortunately this isnt it .
nice atmosphere very good spaetzle and wurstsalad desert was also very delicious .
so clearly with the name joey thai its not your traditional thai place its not its not good staff was nice but the food had no flavor def not a place to go to there are so many more options on bloomfield ave .
i love love love cafe sabarsky my ultimate fave is the hot chocolate and pistachio cake beautiful ambiance great service always a pleasure going there for a nice treat .
this place quite frankly sucks i got fried rice here once and the rice was soggy they overcooked it i also got pad kee mao and it just seemed like they just through whatever vegetables they had laying around the place up the block spice is much better .
the meals are awesome great find doing our visit the ny sausage with cheddar goulash excellent .
everything was bland and not made as requested disappointed .
beatifully decorated welcoming wiener café in the heart of upper east side where you can always come to read a newspaper .
had their tiger cries dish and i was crying they knew that i wanted real spicy thai flavor but they did not make it as i requested what is that about ive had better .
the sausage is awesome with the strawberry layered cake as the end highly recommended .
definitely not the best sushi around pieces are small and overall just unimpressive while prices arent bad you can get better sushi for around the same price elsewhere id recommend fuji sushi which is about 5 minutes away .
this is like going to a restaurant and your building cirta 1914 15 foot ceilings wraparound wood rooms beautiful architecture marble tables menu is of european german style foods excellent .
i really wanted to like handys the location is a quaint throwback and the atmosphere very pleasant but i was there to eat a late breakfast not merely to submerge myself in americana the small bland portions immodestly priced just cant find me recommending a visit .
ive been here 3 times after visiting the museum albeit a little pricey the ambiance and the food makes up for it authentic to the core and a wide variety this place is delicious and quick .
shit service great drinks an unbalanced experience to say the least .
if you enjoy austrian food check out this spot delicious spaetzle dishes and amazing deserts the service was top notch as well for a nyc restaurant prices were reasonable .
how do i delete a review .
after an amazing exhibit one visits the cafe small extremely crowded the food was diverse and amazing i like the fact that the food coincided with the exhibit enjoyable atmosphere despite it being quite crowded expensive be forewarned .
they kicked us out after less than 45 minutes because we werent ordering enough and the food is pretty bad and very overpriced as are the drinks to be honest .
grab a nice viennese lunch and enjoy the neue gallery .
if cheesecake factory is your favorite restaurant you will love this place i however think cheesecake factory is the epitome of over sized over priced hyper mediocrity geronimos has a bit of that going on pitcher of house margeritas was goodish but still quite pricey .
lovely quiet atmosphere gorgeous wood paneling and marble decor we ordered cafes and a goldleafed chocolate mousse cake that was divine not cheap but worth your time after looking through neue gallery and the metropolitan museum .
the outside seating is really the only thing geronimos has going for it otherwise the food is a let down and the drinks are only worth it at happy hour .
had drinks dinner and desert last friday and it was a pleasurable experience my husband and i had the brezen händelmaiers lachsfilet mit mais und zucchini german beers and mozarttorte all were delicious servers were nice will definitely come back .
brutally bad and over priced burgers were average and fries not great daughter ordered mac and cheese and it was a boxed version drowned in butter we should of gone to food revolution around the corner .
awesome bratwurst mit sauerkraut rösterdäpfel the mustard is radical .
got the poutine and almond crusted chicken tenders food was decent enough very good honey mustard robot that served our food could use an upgrade his emotion chip seemed to be malfunctioning would recommend programming him with higher level vocabulary only words he knew were yea and mhm .
cute little cafe in the gallerie very expensive no coffee refills but the food is great and staff are very attentive perfect place for an early breakfast .
was my server drunk not a fan save your money .
yummy and nice cafe within the neue gallerie had the streudel yum .
i had a green with envy bison burger it wasnt bad but not best either the server emily was not good took forever to get the food out then took longtime to get our check food ok service not so ok .
we really enjoy the cake and sausage .
although service was friendly sweetwaters is just standard pub food nothing too special draft guinness was disappointing we stuck with burgers to be safe but they were too thick for our liking and settled like a rock thereafter .
i love this place my trip to the museum is not complete until ive dropped by here its a charming decor very traditional staff is friendly and professional menu is superb everything ive had there has been extremely tasteful looking forward to my next museum visit already .
standard american pub food nothing special i got the rock shrimp and scallops pasta and was really disappointed at the bitter taste of the phosphate treated scallops .
very nice place to have lunch and they have amazing desserts .
after having two dishes come out under cooked i would advise you to go some where else for dinner service was good though the fish with the couscous salad was gross .
overpriced of course but a great setting top rate coffee tea deserts hot chocolate and austrogermanic food a very nice place to take friends meet that special person not quiet but intimate and beautiful .
food was terrible almost diarrhea inducing service was slow and they forgot everything bartender was a total jerk totally obnoxious and ripped us off dont go here if you want to go with a special lady or men unless you plan to dump them there .
roasted bratwurst is great .
the last lunch i had here was below average overpriced and no taste the fish and chips was blah going to avoid this place in the future .
i went here about a month ago for lunch and was so charmed lovely spot .
overpriced poor service and less than adequate food taste make this the worst choice in rutherford .
when im feeling homesick for europe it is fun to stop in and pretend a bit .
i gave it 2 stars cause its just alright not the best falafels in the city and i wish the pittas were a bit thinner so not the best especially if your trying to eat less carbs .
my favorite museum cafe .
why did you replace the vegan cheese with daiya the homemade vegan cheese sauce is what made this place special fine to offer soy free cheese option but dumb to get rid of the original sauce which is what made the sandwich special for all these years .
do you want some leberwurst in a darkened wood interior read the newspaper on a metal hangy thing so you can feel european bretzels galore dense schokokuchens tear inducing bezahlen .
food is meh service is the worst seriously people i work 80 a week in the food service industry and i never act the way these people do .
i just love this place i feel like i am actually in an austrian cafe great service and wonderful atmosphere and food .
just waited 30 min for a meatball sub and fries incredibly slow service foods decent though .
been coming here for 4 years almost every week they have the best coffee and desserts apple strudel and the ambience is great waitstaff is very attentive and courteous wait can be very long for lunch though so come early .
food not that great service not any better .
weiner schnitzel and apfelstrudel cant go wrong tasty espresso .
hot garbage .
i thought this place was charming i had the bratwurst mit sauerkraut and thought the portions were just right but i think the real draw of this place are the unique drink offerings and the dessert menu so i will be back to sample those .
everything is soy based i spent 10 for some veggies on a wheat roll and not a lot of veggies either i would only go again if i was craving vegan ham sausage or chicken but definitely not go out of my way .
so nice place a lot of desserts and my favorite nougat covered hazelnuts .
not worth it .
beautiful place and delicious had the glorious hot chocolate yummy white sausage and pretzel and an almond paste chocolate cake dessert .
went here after a classical concert we were suppose to have a scheduled reception but they stuck us at the bar with their regular customers the bartender was rude and treated his female coworker like a piece of meat wont come here again .
the apple strudel was a hit flaky and not too sweet i had a simple breakfast yesterday 2 eggs and toast the twist was that the soft boiled eggs were served in a martini glass so you could dip your toast in the yolky mix clever .
got there and restaurant was almost empty people at the bar were loud and it was hard to have a conversation felt totally rushed did not even get two bytes into appetizer and got our meals food was ok but not great .
a beautiful setting i had a perfect erbsensuppe mit minze and then a milchkaffee with a sinful topfentorte vienna in new york .
so i took the food to go cause it took forever and a day to get it was ok really didnt get to enjoy it maybe have to give it another try .
best austrian desserts and coffee really does feel like a viennese cafe i like here goulash soup spatzle all sausages hungarian goulash sandwiches sachertorte apple strudel viennese hot chocolate with shlag any coffee style .
not so much it started with a flat stale beer at the bar i gave up at the dinner table when the must have garlic bread was cold over it .
great goulash and service a variety of desserts make this an ideal stop .
had the shrimp scampi and it was terrible how do you make shrimp scampi bad watery sauce not buttery or garlicky the rest of the table said all was mediocre .
the milchrahmstrudel quark cheese strudel with vanilla sauce was easily the best pastry to ever pass my lips get it love it deal with the crowd its worth it .
bad pizza even worse service .
this review is only for afternoon coffee desserts a bit of austriagerman right smack in the heart of the museum mile great beforeafter the met dark refined calming interior excellent coffee elderberry water was refreshing knocked off a star for the desserts which were good but not stellar .
did not go there yet just listed this business to see what people have to say .
this is one of my very favorite hidden gems on ues a great respite from snowy afternoons in central park the double dark chocolate cake is sure winner true viennese treat .
how can the fish be any good i hear he doesnt pay his vendors .
try apple strudel with hot chocolate they are great .
burger and minute steak were both all gristle .
enter a cafe in vienna without the airfare bratwurst salads soups scrumptious desserts espresso wine idyllic atmosphere after a delicious european meal visit the neue galerie get your austrian on .
an institution its never been great but now that btv has a five guys theres no reason to put up with the greasy frys and wretched burgers maybe the creemee window is good .
i pity the fool who doesnt order the apple strudel .
fries were ok but the burgers were not what i expected they were really tiny and the meat seemed to have been flattened by a semi .
sacher torte i really do not need to say anything else all you need to know is right there in big obnoxious capital letters .
i would have better off at the wendys the fries are soggy and greasy my burger was flavorless and boring it had cheese bacon tomato and lettuce but it was tasteless my boyfriends hot dog was fine though nothing to write home about .
an excellent place to have a relaxing delicious meal between exhibits anywhere on museum mile eating at sabarsky isnt cheap but is as much of a treat as ive ever had .
the quality was poor the service was poor and the restaurant was dirty i think a chain would have been better and i really dislike chains .
black bean burger wasnt too tasty the parmesan fries amazing good service awesome interior surprises at every turn .
omg french food done as badly as you could possibly do french food rubbery scallops bitter spinach staff with no wine know how really really bad despite good reputation and good company .
great atmosphere for dining cozy with lots of dog related wall art we had kale salad mushroom soup and the braised pork shank all were very good .
great food but totally unreasonable staff tried making a big reservation and was completely mishandled by the manager been going here for years but really disappointed there are plenty of more friendly places in tribeca .
fourthfifth time ive been consistently great food fantastic service ability to accommodate changes in party size food preferences love this place cute alcoves for bigger parties really attentive to detail food is amazing drinks are reasonably priced go period .
food was mediocre at best .
great place staff is so friendly natalie the bartender is awesome and super nice had the veggie burger on the lunch menu and it was yummy i will definitely be back .
good food but service that is beyond terrible .
amazing food every time i go there a little pricy but totally worth it when you want a delicious brunch in a cute little area beautiful decorations as well .
cute décor but there are definitely much better gourmet burgers to be had in this city like rubys in nolita however the fries were the saving grace of my meal .
we had a work lunch here i had the pulled pork sandwich with some kind of korean spicy sauce it was ok th four stars are for our server i forgot his name but he was absolutely great the decor and ambience is nice as well .
art deco diner that gets by on reputation .
great food great service i have no complaint i came during university city restaurant week last summer and i am still thinking about how much i enjoyed myself .
odeon is overrated food is average but overpriced service is ok id rather go to edwards or petite abeille across the street .
really good food but i wish their menu had more things to choose from the fries were delicious and so were our main entrees panini and burger i definitely recommend customers sit at the bar to be served because theres a 10 discount if you do .
my visit was for a businessbirthday celebration the food was just ok the service was terribly slow there are too many amazing restaurants to try i wont be back .
hands down white dog cafe has the most consistent amazing meals whether it be for brunch lunch or dinner there is great ambiance indoors and out when the weatehr cooperates i highly recommend this to anyone who is looking for a delicious locally sourced meal .
if youre veg this place will impress you with its vast assortment of vegetarian dishes but if youre omnivorous this place is going to really let you down i havent had chinese food this mediocre in a long long time .
one of the better brunch options in university city perfectly runny eggs benedict i suggest the bottomless brunch greyhounds mimosas bloody maries always friendly service and make sure to bring your dog .
didnt care for the vegan chicken was very hard and tough to chew the general tsos sauce had good flavor tho maybe the real meat is better but i saw they had a large selection of vegetarian options so i figured they might be good .
good grub .
slow service out of noodles now really this used to be the place for chinese food ownership change has made this a no go for me .
go here as soon as possible the food is fresh and delicious a little on the pricier side but worth it insider tip at lunch you get 10 off your check if you sit in the bar area .
i loved this place when it was puket and i went when they first opened as mint not impressed sucks i miss puket .
mushroom soup is absolutely delish i get it every time turkey burger fries were also good a little bit of a wait for our food today but the service was attentive .
the food tasted like it was frozen for a long time and microwaved to order we would never go back the food is seriously bad what a shame .
excellent food service and atmosphere our party of 6 decided to order the 4 course prefix my main dish was trout and it was delicious the ingredients are top notch and i will be back .
no good .
sea bass had great texture taste and was well seasoned oysters were a bit small for the price amuse bouche was nice eclectic decor excellent service .
after really good turkish food in europe this is just meh soso if you are bored and craving something different .
12 for bottomless mimosas bloodies sangria and greyhounds i had seven i think i just won at brunch strike that drunch .
if youre gay do not come here because bartender luis will call you a faggot in spanish i am disgusted and hurt no way to run a restaurant you deserve 0 stars .
a perennial favorite for my family we can always find food we all enjoy excellent for entertaining guests as well recommend it for family or professional gatherings .
absolutely rude venue be prepared to wait 3x what theyre predicting during prime time food not worth it .
food is very good and fresh the atmosphere is very private and intimate good place to bring a date do yourself a favor and get the saucony creek schnicklefritz beer it will not let you down .
food is very tasty but the wait staff is horrible it always has been and apparently it always will be its like they are mentally challenged .
the coziest place in town excellent food relaxing and has a lot of charm a must visit place if you already havent .
worst service ever i went here bc im latina and what a deception a lot of people in the rest i was waiting stand up during 20 mins for a table and the staff was so rude there no space .
loved happy hour sitting at the bar fried pickles and tuna tartare were great choices sitting at certain parts of the bar were a bit hectic as they get lots of foot traffic from patrons entering the restaurant so just watch out for that and youre golden .
yuca has some great brunch food but the service is pretty terrible and i probably wont be back due to that .
everything was delicious we did the trasting menu it was four courses and for 15 we also added on the alcohol pairing absolutely no complaints the atmosphere is quaint and charming and server was excellent i will definitely be going back .
i wish is not stars for this place is horrible service is the worse in n y this waitress she was horrible food is horrible there is nothing good to say about this place only horrible .
i love white dog its my favorite place to meet friends for happy hour 5 glasses of good wine 3 craft beers and delicious 35 dishes that are scaled down versions of the restaurants signature food the service is almost always great .
i really dont understand the amazing reviews about this place food was just plain bad drinks not well mixed guacamole has no taste the staff is friendly but for a saturday night at 11 in nyc the place was empty really disappointed and wouldnt go back there .
they change menus frequently .
the 2 stars are for the food .
the tofu was decent the steak and pasta were tasty and the service was above par .
drinks are great but food is consistently disappointing i really wanted to love this place but they almost always overcook and under season meat also its not cheap the yuca fries are pretty good though .
great spot from start to finish the food was delicious pear salad and steak frites awesomeness .
the bar is decent but the service is very very mediocre i dont think the crowd here is particularly classy anyways so that goes with the place ive heard the brunch is good but im not a bunchtype so basically ill never go here again .
so good .
dont bother coming here service was bad fly was in my water shell pieces in my crab cakes poaches eggs were basically raw did i mention our waitress was rude and terrible .
the white dog is amazing i got the burger and it was so huge that it probably could have been for like two people the french toast was a little too heavy and sweet but it also was huge .
great for gringos who love latino stereotypes annoying if you are are not easily impressed by paprika and yuca if you have grown up eating these dishes you will be disappointed .
a good place near upenn where everything is farmtotable the service can be a little uneven but the food is good .
if you make it for happy hour then it is worth it if you miss happy hour then that a whole different story they do make good drinks here the food is ok i highly dislike the looooong wait time the unwelcoming staff .
had lunch there when i visited upenn very good environment they have a theme of dogs which is very adorable food is authentic and of good quality will def go back for dinner next time .
went here once for dinner and wouldnt try it again the portions are huge for tapas but everything was way too salty we tried five different dishes and none of them were any good .
fantastic restaurant my family has eaten here a number of times and the food is always good we have tried breakfast lunch and dinner always a variety and always interesting fresh delicious definitely a favorite .
bad service bad food and this place ruined my brunch experience and made me bitter betty for the week to follow .
amazing brunch you feel very fancy and the service is great though i think their tables are too small and they have too many decorations last time i had their fried egg sandwich which was super tasty definitely all of my calories for the whole day but good .
this place had a malodorus smell of puke everywhere except in the bathroom the sangria was watery save your money and bother with this place for the price they charge it should smell like roses in their i had to run out of that place .
very good great brew yards saison great burrata and really great gnocchi .
very disappointing service the wait staff was extremely rude .
we sat outside and the ambience is beautiful food and booze were equally good great wait staff restaurant is on a quiet street and outdoor seating is pet friendly .
service is not good dont know what people are saying and the gauc salsa was without taste and bland the mango mojito was really good but the only reason why this venue gets two stars .
super quick service awesome mushroom soup very rich and thick also very interesting beet salad definitely a great place to eat a little pricey but doable for a great quality meal .
still dont see what all the fuss is about food is mediocre and service spotty lorenzos is close and better .
a great place to eat in university city great food and great beer the only downfall is the amount of penndrexel students .
been here 3 times for brunch food usually good but my real complaint i drove 30 min into city for the bloody mary bar and i was paying 10 a piece for weak drinks this happened all 3 times with the drinks wont be going back .
lovely food great atmosphere awesome 10 drink special for brunch unlimited mimosas tap water is nasty though seriously white dog get a filter .
much left to desire if you ask me over priced drinks smells like a dirty basement good luck being acknowledged if youd like a glass of water .
great decor good service annoying clientele delicious food a little overpriced which is why im not willing to make the trek from south philly to west philly when i can just go to sabrinas and get overcharged for french toast .
went on a gloomy sunday around 12 waited for a table for 20 minutes it was packed service was friendly but we received very little of it waited for an order of pancakes side if sausage and eggs benedict for 1 hour definitely not worth the wait .
top spot for brunch in university city perfect place to do some day drinking with their aycd all you can drink mimosas or bottomless bloody marys very much a farmtotable place highlights include pork roll and egg sandwich and the brunch burger .
if you like being packed in a small space waiting 15 min for a drink and waiting in a long line for the bathroom then this place is for you the only positive was the beer selection the only positive got one drink and peaced out .
very tasty brunch old old building great use of space love the decor .
friday night overly crowded obnoxious patrons some coming three at a time out of a bathroom and a long wait for bland food yeah this place blows .
had the fried green tomato sandwich but with smoked salmon it was fantastic .
looks cool decent beer selection worst food maybe it was a bad day sunday but he guacamole and salsa were straight from the container and the other food just didnt have much taste at all other than that its alright maybe id go back for the nightlife .
been here for brunch a few times definitely worth the price for some of the dishes like the waffles nice farmhouse style dining a bit cramped but will do .
while a fun and cosy atmosphere with decent food skip dessert the chocolate cake we ordered had been sitting in the fridge too long and tasted like well fridge .
great lil hidden place near penn .
decent atmosphere not too distracting decor limited menu selection for vegetarians beer list is minimal and fairly pricey i prefer the tria on 18th street in the french quarter near rittenhouse square better food nicer atmosphere .
it was almost good enough to justify the prices .
world famous crabby fries terrible frozen fries sprinkled with old bay no crab meat please dont advertise crabby fries and not have crab meat on the fries terrible .
delicious brussell sprouts .
shame on them mobile philly combusine… .
always good .
well perhaps i wasnt drink enough but from their industrial process cheese sauce and fries to their fatty burgers and bland chicken cheesesteak this place is a dive of the worst kind philadelphia has better places o eat avoid it .
the food was fresh and delicious service was a little slow so do not go if you are in a hurry the interior feels quaint and homey like an old philadelphia tavern .
disappointed .
delicious pumpkin bisque .
salty overly salted food crab fries need to be smothered in ketchup to counterbalance the salty seasoning the sauce for shrimp and crabsalty crab cakes were good .
especially for brunch this place delivers they have exceptional food for a fairly reasonable price will keep coming back and definitely a place i would take outoftown visitors to university city or philadelphia in general .
lazy waitresses stale beers bad music horrible food yeah pretty much the worst place ever .
sit in the bar section for the best food at the best prices .
the place is huge they have a variety of food items on the menu crab fries are good but cmon theyre french fries with old bay big whoop service is slow and staff is unfriendly .
good food and locally grown a fun place to go for a nice dinner .
horrible service cold fries overpriced beer stay away .
as consistent as they come with fresh seasonal offerings great ales wait time can be long at lunch so be forewarned but they deliver on the promise .
worst service ever its not crowded at all and the waitress hasnt been by our table in an hour this pace has gone down hill and they dont seem to care at all do everyone a favor and close .
i was there with a group most people liked their entrees which however were a bit small great fish and chips love the local beer selection no one liked the olive oil ice cream .
if you are looking for good food dont go here mediocre at best salty expensive and boring .
the food was delicious i got the lamb bolognese but the service was a bit slow .
i really wanted to love cps the atmosphere is terriic beyond that i thought that the service was slow and the food mediocre i have been here three times fun place on the way to the game but not my first choice as a dining destination .
mm very nice new england bar atmosphere the sunflower salad was good and the porcinibrushed tofu was yummy over the squash risotto fish and chips was huge and the fries were wellseasoned banana ice cream and bread pudding was just big enough .
if you have to go here stick with the beer the food is massproduced defrosted salty nastiness its basically like being at the game without the benefit of actually seeing any of the action .
an excellent place to take a visitor for a nice lunch in university city friendly service nice decor and good food i recommend the spicy lamb bolognese and the burgers are good too .
typical philly anointing an eatery which is far from anything special the crab fries ummm fries with crab seasonings ooo wow big deal who cares nothing special its an over priced bar with lousy service fun place to watch football but then again so is many other places .
what a delicious meal i had a lamb special that was quite tasty and there is a good selection of drinks only downside is that it costs too much to go there every day .
crab fries are meh typical sports bar nothing more worth noting .
a wonderful gem offering great portions and quality food reasonably priced i had a spicy lamb bolognese which was delicious a friend had a fried risotto dish which was even better would highly recommend either of these dishes .
i do not go to sports bars especially bars with a bunch of green faced neanderthal hooligans .
delicious gourmet local food great flavor combinations a bit pricey for the portions try the lamb penne .
they have new menus they are so big they take half of the table plus the uped the price on everything and the service went down hill like the menus new people working here some old head with curly hair wont be back for a wile .
gotta love white dog the food and service is reliably good and there are so many nooks of the restaurant you always have a good amount of privacy .
didnt eat there just went for drinks on a thursday night crowded and small .
the white dog cafes food is not only fantastic its locally sourced i cant comment on the service because i ate it next door at the saturn hair club but the food is impeccable try the curried cauliflower .
i cant believe the wings got such good reviews the wings we got were just okay weve definitely had better they were crispy and thin not juicy at all it was a huge disappointment .
beet salad lamb bolognese rigatoni lobster mac n cheese everything was delish wonder why they sat us in the fancy area where we were the only two patrons while there were dozens of others in the many diff levels of the restaurant service is great food is great .
the wait for food was grueling the wait for beer was not much better but they did have heineken on tap the place is really small but they have a lot of games on the tvs and the servers are pleasant .
food was delicious and atmosphere was very nice frankly the most tender fillet mignon ive ever had in philly .
like everyone else said great wings crappy service the girls there are consistently rude or just bitches they lose a ton of business because of this .
the food was really great the salmon was super light buttery flaky and the vegetables just perfectly cooked too bad they were running out of all the drinks we were ordering that night but all in all we had a good experience .
the food was great but the waitress was really rude and she took for ever taking our order and getting our food she made the experience very uncomfortable .
this place is a philly institution and has only gotten better under new management love that they are still committed to organic local food lamb bolognaise is to die for though good i think the brunch offerings could be a little more imaginative .
terrible service we paid a 5 cover for each of us 5 ordered twice and never got drinks .

maple cremees amazing and i dont particularly like ice cream super delicious and i recommend them to everyone who takes a walk around the lakefront .
tasteless extortion why has no one opened up something to compete with these losers .

for the soft serve creemee ice cream had maple and chocolate nice servers great view of lake .
yes the prices beyond mere unconscionability reach the heady level of outright extortion if youre prepared to pay 25 cents for an individual pill of tylenol calculated on the perpackage basis or five dollars for milk then by all means knock yourself out .

they make a mashpotato pizza that is awesome i wish they continued making pizzas in the outdoor oven because i thought those were some of the best pizza recipes in new haven i think the outdoor pizza was a temporary promotional thing but they were amazing .

without a doubt the best service the staff were cheerful and were not cheap in their helpings yummy .

the absolute best garlic naan fantastic service and tasty freshcooked food the vegetable samosas are wonderfully spiced this is a new favorite spot if it were closer to my apartment i would eat there at least once a week .
this place is way over hyped if you like to wait 45 minutes for tacos surrounded by rued and pushy people then this is the place for you .
bit pricey but food is always fresh location is clean very humble and relaxing atmosphere .
all the ambiance of sitting in the living room of a cheap apartment with 40 drunk people the food is average at best im not mad because it was free and the servers are clearly busting their butts but id never go back .

i went here and had the worst and most ride service i have ever experienced most of the people were okay but the kid trying to take my order and the cashier were horrible food was average nothing special and too greasy .
am here now free wifi good food reasonable prices ok to sit for a while bottomless mug of coffee a new favorite spot will definetly come again .
cheap but hey you get what you pay for overprocessed cold cuts greasy fried food nasty lettuce boring bread did i mention its cheap there are plenty of better places in town unless youre on a tight budget .
came here for brunch while on vacation my fiancé and i both had the apple pue french toast and it was really good great atmosphere and very friendly staff would definitely recommend and revisit in the future .
used to be great back in the day now a bunch of disrespectful goons and brown lettuce .
with people like colleen d opening up great quality stores like this its our duty to support local businesses to keep them open .
i used to go here all the time until the help changed the food is good but the help is not polite and disrespectful they think they are the only place around the place needs to find a way to maintain a crowd better .
coffee la colombe was soso but its better than youll find at most places what really sets this place apart though are the vegetarian options e g being able to substitute seitan for what would otherwise be a meaty burrito .
average at best .
wonderful find i was just passing through the area and yelped this location thank you .
worst cheesesteak ever added with bad service and hoagie haven was hoagie hell .
a great place to chill their breakfasts are fresh they have great choices for lunch as well awesomely friendly staff .
food is okay but people worked there are impatient and not very friendly if you want to come up with all the fancy names you better give your firsttime customers some time to figure them out body bag what the heck is that .
best breakfast burrito in philly i cannot get enough of it i eat here at least once a week and have never had anything else for breakfast its that good seriously if you like a little kick order it with sriracha in it .
the sandwiches at wawa are way better and dont make you feel bleh afterward i must say though the fried mac and cheese at hoagie haven is delicious but again bleh .
still love my black n brew cafe nice place to grab a quick breakfast bite in the morning artsy hipster feel but cool light energy the staff are wonderfully attentive a great time to have with your cup of joe .
over rated the food is pure garbage .
good coffee and i strongly recommend the vegan hash .
greasy junk honestly you take two bites of a fat lady or a sanchez and youre done with it their buffalo fries are good though hence two stars .
pancakes were good eggs were ehh i dont know if ill come here famished ever again but it was cheap and seems like an ok place to hang out .
i dont get it people swear by this place but i think its because any food tastes good when you are drunk and hungry it is open late and is right beside the ivy inn i think the sandwiches from the wawa are better .
they brew la colombe never a bad thing they have a healthy menu and vegan options always a plus friendly staff tasty baked goods .
ordered take out and got gnocchi and falafel gyro it was very bland from the brief time i spent at the bar the ambiance seemed nice and the bartender was friendly for its price the food was disappointing .
wonderful neighborhood spot had the short stack 2 whole wheat pancakes with chocolate chips great flavor and you wont feel like a boulder has been lodged in your stomach after consuming the service was very friendly and personable and the restroom immaculate always a plus after coffee .
they just decided not to do brunch today and then the girl at the bar had an attitude about it stay away .
great quality food and service the breakfast menu includes sandwiches great coffee and a great breakfast burrito which is my favorite outside and inside seating makes it great for all all is great here .
avoid mandatory 20 tip that is not on the menu bad service under staffed small portions nothing good about this place avoid .
this shop has a pretty good breakfast menu to go along with the coffe they serve which is pretty good nice interior pleasant workers and wifi good luck finding parking though thats the only downside to shopping in this area .
least friendly bartender of the day as i look around every single person is drinking out of a straw meh .
i go as much as possible mostly breakfast all the meals are yummy great service great personalites of the people who work there always makes my morning great smoothies and chai .
this is where older yuppies and high bank account types go to drink .
had breakfast banana pancakes and turkey bacon both of which were really good but not nearly as good as the service was .
the tapas here were fair ive definitely had better tapas for less but its got a great vibe and the staff is fantastic its a not a bad way to spend an evening but if youre looking for amazing tapas keep looking .
black n brew is one of my favorite neighborhood brunch spots theres always and excellent selection of food love the specialty french toast at a very fair price the coffee is nice and strong the staff always attentive and the atmosphere always warm give it a try .
another snobbish over priced tapas bar i wish casa mono didnt launch this trend they totally missed the concept of tapas spain is looking at you with angry eyes also the food is not that good .
the only reason i gave it 4 stars is because they close at 5 or 4 on weekends it would be nice if they were open later .
humdrum food outrageously expensive pitcher of sangria 40 decent service and music better tapas places exist in nyc but where .
came here on a stressful morning after a bridal fitting not mine and it was perfect a laid back cafe with generous coffee servings and the best brunch around order the butterscotch pancakes or toasted banana bread theyre unbelievable plus the cafe is doggie friendly .
only one dish of twelve split by three people was memorable and we spent 300 which was totally ridiculous that being said nothing was horriblejust undistinguished .
this place made me like breakfast burritos theyre awesome the coffee is eh i cant tell if its really strong or just really burnt added plus they dont mind if you bring your dog s inside while waiting for your takeout .
so overated disappointing sangria had a gallon of ice saltcod fritters had no taste at all dates left a bad aftertaste shrimp was very good potatoes were tasty overall no way best tapas bland .
ive been here a couple times and this place has impressed each time they have a nice broad selection of menu items and they serve em hot its one of those orderatthecounter and haveaseatwhiletheycook places its good .
two stars for service food was way too salty two of us spent 50 for lunch without drinks and had to have lunch again .
under new ownership the sauce is much much better now it tastes more fresh than before and is no longer this weird sour tomato goop had the brooklyn pie and it was very very good would recommend again now that its under new ownership .
sigh love the food though have not been able to get them to deliver the last 4 times weve called with no explanation guess the delivery every day doesnt apply to every day plenty of other places to try .
this is the best pizza around the brooklyn is better than any i have had anywhere else the bbq chicken and buffalo chicken are also excellent .
first and last time ever ordering this from nasty place it took 2 hours for the food to come i ordered chicken tenders and fries i only got two little chicken tenders the guy who delivered the food was very rude i wouldnt recommend it .
i have had most things on the menu you really cant go wrong with any of them the wraps pizza and wings are all very good .
good bar but the sociallymentally handicapped doormanwaiter ruins it .
one of the better pizza places ive been to on a good day the minestrone soup is killer lacking consistency in the kitchen on certain days but a good experience overall .
free jukebox was nice but dinner closed at eight and no beers on tap awful burger .
there fresh rolls lack shrimp there are only two pieces where other places have 3 the pho is phenomenal better than other places in the area but it is also about 2 up in price vs other places enjoy .
one of the worst restaurants in chinatown to start my rangoon appetizer favorites was greasy my chilli seafood dish was too salty my mandalay nungyi noodle was room temperature and the noodles were over cooked .
amazing food they need to charge more very healthy fresh and when you leave you feel great .
i didnt quite like the food here everything was way too oily and felt like the dishes were a poor copy of penang and banana leaf would not come again and they dont accept american express .
best authentic viet food around the hartford area .
disappointing brunch had omelette if thats what you want to call it instead one of those bad diner omelettes dry overcooked egg pancake that they fold over after burning home fires mush hamburger frozen patty what a shame .
great food nice and friendly services its pretty good for a restaurant that just opened i love it people shouldnt miss this place its great .
prices are not as advertised charge you 60 more than what prices are listed and then pretend they dont know english when you ask them about it .
just opened march 2013 friendly service good prices spare but comfortable interior my first meal was the pork chop plate with egg i asked for and got it with my favorite broken rice very good ill be back to try more items .
there should be an option for 0 stars for places like this .
im glad this place is around its an easy stop to grab a couple sandwiches and its a convenient liquor store since they sell beer wine and hard alcohol .
honestly the food is okay at best got the beef broccoli with brown rice the won ton soup wad decent .
one of our favorite locals for great sandwiches interesting wine and friendly service cant go wrong with a sloppy joe excellent gazpacho .
very disappointing i ordered the tomato pizza and what i got was more like i regular pizza with a salad dumped on top of it maybe i am not hip enough to appreciate artisan pizza but i just wanted a good pie and this didnt satisfy .
great deli and solid selection of fooddrinks in general service is very good everyone is helpful and nice great lunch spot .
ive been here about 10 times since february impressive place great atmosphere great beer and usually great food but the quality had declined over the past few months overcooked brisket and ribs subpar bacon hopefully they can turn this back around .
great gourmet style deli and food market they have the famous town hall deli sloppy joes and pals soup call order in otherwise youll drop a ton of money on the fancy sides available wish they delivered .
place sucks bad food bad drinks not worth it unless youre having a quick beer with a group .
best delifood in north jersey i have been there several times and have never had a bad meal my go to are the joes but again nothing is bad .
ambiance is nice only issue is that no one was in the place and its friday .
although pricey sandwiches at fairchilds are worth every penny i typically opt for the turkey on country white but the ham and brie is also delicious also am a fan of their rotating craft beer selection .
this place is part of restaurant com beware they do not honor on saturday and it is not noted they scam the customer and blame restaurant com service is poor if you are a male couple .
fairchilds market is a delightful place to dine the people are kind and helpful especially the people behind the counter and in the deli my favorite meal is the french fries everything has great quality and i cant be more delighted with the service go go go briana .
pizza was good beans with burnt ends where us the meat service was okay salmon cake special so so all in all not impressed .
delicious im back in nj for a visit im not sure i can go back without a years supply of the thincrust cheese pies .
terrible service and the owner is just flat out unfriendly ive been there many times before yet it never improves .
max has the best food and pizza around .
terrible experience slow service people who have been waiting are getting up and walking out before their food arrives never again .
this place has yet to disappoint so much great food for dirt cheap prices all the servers are nice and the food comes out very fast best bbq place in the entire area .
14 for slice pork 17 for chicken no no go get something else not recommend not come back .
good stuff all around cant go wrong they will make your chicken crispy if that is the way you like it i do and spicier upon request i do as well never have been let down que delicia .
good food but overpriced yelp said two dollar signs but for my girlfriend and i our bill was 50 all we ordered was two entrees and 2 sodas .
we had an amazing meal chicken ribs rice and fries all of it was finger licking good so flavorful im looking forward to going back and checking out the salmon and salad you have got to try this place .
service was great but the food was way too overcooked and dry garlic rice could have used more garlic flavor as well .
love this place food is great and those who work there are good busy spot but overall very good .
the food here was average at best it didnt taste like authentic filipino food it was like a fusion restaurant mediocre .
i had the garlic clams wow they were delicious also had half portion of garlic shrimp which i had to take home as arnold saidill be back .
okay i finally got a hold of the mango pudding eck gross so damn sweet yikes i should have just stuck to their halo halo and flan s got the dasilog ummm i am not into this skinny fish .
hands down the best bbq place in newark or neighboring towns .
fuck you tripe .
for all the great churrascerias in newark this is the best simple good ass food and cant beat the price to portion ratio .
not a great place for dining late kitchen closes promptly at 10 pm we were not allowed to order halohalo at 1020 pm on a saturday night other than that the sisig was ok and the palabok was tasty .
hands down the best portuguese bbq in newark actually the best in nj i never leave the ironbound without stopping off for some chicken and ribs .
the tonic in my gt was flat the cheese on the top of my onion soup was barely melted and the short ribs were very dry additionally it took us 30 minutes to get a check will not be going back .
in terms of standard bbq fare in the ironbound most of these restaurants have a hard time distinguishing themselves but not elm st with attention to detail and great customer service the elm st peeps always come through with fresh hot food always served with a smile .
food is meeh lamb meatballs were dry and the crab croquettes werent anything special more breading than crab .
my favorite is the broiled striped bass with salad that rocks on other days i go for their tbone steak or the chicken best food around the vicinity for a very reasonable price .
the worst place ever it took 30 minutes to get our food then when they brought it they brought the wrong food then they said they would adjust the bill and they actually overcharged us would not recommend this for anyone .
best portion size food is amazing service is exemplary love coming here my favorite place by far .
service was nice and friendly food was cooked well but unfortunately very boring not sure why there was so much hype over this restaurant .
great food and wonderful service has turned this into a family favorite .
i have wanting to try this place for awhile and i was pretty disappointed overall i dont get what the big deal is the food was bland and nothing special ive had much better culinary experiences .
the vodka sauce on the the pasta was very good and i liked so much and i also liked pesto sauce too .
the food was not exceptional we saw julianne moore .
the food is phenomenal climate control and building environment are a little lacking but that vodka rigatoni was soooooo good service was attentive .
mostly curb appeal .
we had a threw my dad a surprise party here when he hit 50 everything was delicious and they provided countless great courses kudos to the friendly staff .
went today just to try the sliders since there were so many reviews on it disappointment it was ok but i wouldnt go back for it a second time .
a local company that i was visiting recently took me to this restaurant for lunch the food was excellent and the staff was very attentive i look forward to making a return visit to the area so that i can make a return visit to leonardos ii .
i went there for brunch one cold sunday morning meh ok but nothing to brag about nice location but not impressed with food at all i feel like theres too much hype about this place or maybe i went there on their unusually bad day .
this place is probably the most coolest and most tastiest restaurant to eat at best pizzeria in hartford connecticut hands down great food and everything .
overpriced and the food isnt that great prices seem to also fluctuate on certain days .
this is the hubs 1 favorite place in new york he always gets the beef marrow oxtail steak tartare fried oysters whenever we have friends in town we always bring them here its a great experience for dining and even better for late night .
food was barely above airline quality couldnt take more than a few bites how do you screw up a sandwich and salad this badly .
all of the seafood is excellent also had the bone marrow ox and it was really good .
we ordered a nacho plate and a caesar salad thinking we could eat sooner than later but no after a full hour as we were just getting ready to leave the food arrived unfortunately our 2nd drinks were charged to us thus making a return highly unlikely .
great food and drinks the bone marrow with oxtail marmalade and duck breast are not to be missed taking off a star because they dont take reservations for parties of less than 5 meaning there is often a long wait for a table .
food was okay but expensive average for burlington .
one of my all time favorite places to go eat in the city food is amazing and hours are the best you cant go wrong with anything on the menu from the oysters to the pierogis to the fried chicken thats just a few great dishes .
bad service food is just ok love the back seating with the porch area though one time we ate in the windows facing church street and there were ants everywhere .
what a great place to come get a meal everything is generally good the place has a great feel and there is a ton of good booze combine that with the fact that the kitchen is open until 4am and you have a great place to hang out .
i have found the vegetarian options to be ultra boring the service was good but i have just never been at all happy about the food .
the food here is superb i enjoy their paella it always proves to be a satisfying meal this place has a great atmosphere with friendly staff this is one of the best places to dine in soho and along sullivan street .
the most disappointing part was the dessert the cookies were not home made and neither were the cinnamon buns the sandwich was ok a bit overpriced probably wont go back .
i came here for the seafood everything was fresh i didnt like the setup of the seating that much seemed crowded but that is just me .
the crepes are delicious but be prepared to carve out a large portion of your day to eat here the wait is incredibly long always the service is poor and very slow so if you have three hours its worth the wait .
pretty good food especially the sashimi and sushi its a tad expensive and difficult to get a table at peak hours .
food quality and quantity has gone down also service staff has changed and needs improving sad because this place use to be awesome .
bone marrow fried chicken repeat amazing food but they dont take reservations so the wait can vary once went somewhere else for dinner it was so blah i came to blue ribbon because i knew it would revive the night .
owner is rude crepes are good but not worth the half hour or forty minute wait lost a good customer because of the long wait without an apology when the crepes finally came .
easily best restaurant in nyc every single food item is just superb staff is 6 stars out of 5 and the seafood tower royale is the best in the world literally make sure to get enough shots of stoli with the tower for everybody at the table .
rude service from barista who gave me caffeinated coffee when i clearly asked for decaff the 10 preserved tuna sandwich is actually regular canned tuna a little too much wburg attitude for the neighborhood .
we absolutely loved this place great food great service so close to the subway that you can have dinner there and take the subway to times square for the shows love this place .
kind of like chipotle or moes but not quite the same the concept is pick your own ingredients the ingredients are just so so and not my taste the place is clean and fast so they have that going for them .
the best all of the sushi is super fresh the service is impeccable the staff is super friendly the atmosphere is great one of my favorite places .
hairs in the salsa and workers dont wear hair nets never going back gross .
whats awesome about this place besides it opens until 4 a m and cure my oysters craving it has the best bone marrow the best ive ever had and tasty sweet and spicy catfish .
small portions and not as tasty as some of the alternatives service was friendly but dont recommend going here if you are hungry probably a slight step up above taco bell but the price difference is a deal breaker for me .
food is awesoome like really really good not fancy but nice young and chill pretty much perfect .
extremely overrated and crowded i have never had a meal here that i thought was anything special there are many better restaurants in the area i dont understand all of the positive reviews .
went there last saturday to celebrate friends birthday excellent food got short ribs the best ever got also tried friends order trout fresh and delicious love bread as well .
not a great value food was very good but not special in any way the wine list is exceptional but the prices are far higher than could be justified by the food and wine service is good atmosphere is there are better places with lower prices choose elsewhere .
duck sandwich at 2 am was one of the most amazing things ive ever had oysters were delicious and our server was the kindest person i cant wait to get back here .
the restaurant is small and was way overcrowded for the space we were seated 45 minutes after our reservation time food so so not worth the wait and the establishment attempting to get way too much out of their little space .
late night quality dining fare we found this lovely little place serendipitously and were greatly rewarded the menu and wine list were solid and the service was prompt i have no real complaints only compliments great place to go after the show .
im surprised by all the raving reviews ambience is a nice trendy atmosphere but ive been here twice and i left thinking nothing special each time i went into it with an open mind ordered differently the 2nd time too if its busy the parking situation sucks too .
truly gutbusting gallbladderpunching appetizers just get your own order of the marrowmarmalade already .
ambiance and service was good but food and drinks were nothing to write home about and it was also quite expensive would not recommend it as you could find much better restaurants for this price .
great food attentive waitstaff small and intimate an overall great combination had the ravioli and was pleasantly surprised friends had the steak upon the suggestion from the waiter hours later we were still talking how delightful was the place .
ive been here 3 times and 3 times i have not enjoyed any of what i ate i kept going back because of all the hype smh i dont get the masses sometimes .
the rack of lamb is bomb it honestly might be the best rack of lamb i have ever had i highly recommend it .
this is a classic breakfast place this place needs a stat clean up it is not pretty at all it is crowded and cramped food is ok very trendy type of place definitely need some hygiene checks waitstaff is affected .
review to follow .
most overrated brunch in philly long wait for exceedingly average food in a small loud and crowded space better options abound for brunch .
dinner wasnt that great but i think this place has one of the best brunches in the city i usually have the eggs benedict and its delicious .
sams needs a better system the wait is ridiculous outside and in your told 15 min and wait 45min get in and waited another 15 to give your order and they tell you their out of items on the today special wtf .
came here on a tuesday night with a girlfriend for some drinks and oysters fresh and delicious try lol .
not feeling the service love here no lovey no goey .
had to go with the fried chicken at the servers recommendation and it did not disappoint .
the food was not very good the biscuit is huge dry and salty and i love salt the homefries are roasted potatoes and the homemade ketchup is marinara roasted potatoes with marinara if it said that on the menu nobody would order it .
i am so lucky to live one block from this place they have the best fried chicken i should know because i grew up in georgia the food here is not trendy like most restaurants downtown i could eat here a few times a week .
very disappointing rude person taking orders on the phone and was told there is a 30 credit card minimum to me that sounds crazy terrible customer service dont bother since there are many other places that treat customers well .
food was amazing and they have great hours you can order food until 4am this beats any restaurant in the area .
very disappointing after reading all the rave reviews came here for the sushi rolls lunch with high expectations got 3 different rolls none of which seemed fresh all were bordering on disgusting definitely wont be back .
great ambiance friendly staff amazing food but extremely pricey if i could afford this place i would go every week .
i was near 265 church st enroute for some thai food instead i decided to try fryborg for the 1st time the staff was very pleasant cordial i opted for the french fries overall it was an ok experience due to too much salt added to the fries .
so completely very satisfied raw oyster could have been a little more choice but still great i had the bone marrow and creamy oxtail for appetizer and their short ribs main course was outstanding definitely a new favorite on my list and look forward to many more visits .
not veggie friendly there is one sandwich and the only good thing about it is the bread lots of raw spinach and mushrooms meh and aioli or something its expensive church street though so what do you expect .
such a great date night spot friendly staff good food and great drinks highlights are the fried chicken and catfish be prepared to wait for a bit on a weekend night but they do a great job of moving tables along quickly and the bar wasnt too crowded .
took them 15 minutes to nuke a hot chocolate and put a cookie on a plate if youre retired and waiting for the inevitable might as well spend it waiting here to be served .
great restaurant fresh perfect portions great customer service highly recommended .
i was not impressed with this place at all i had a restaurant com certificate and im sorry i wasted it on this place service was ok friendly but not overly attentive but sushi was not very tasty i wouldnt go come back here for sushi boo .
cool place love the atmosphere and location late night great vibes little expensive for the area but worth it can only speak for the oysters which were nice i feel like oysters are either good or bad theres not really an inbetween .
ninos used to have the best penne and chicken in vodka sauce we used to look forward to it on fridays i guess we will have to look for another spot who ever the cook was bring him back please .
friday night at 200am still lively and delicious .
no good soggy and oily pizza did not like it at all the middle of the pizza was like a chunk of cheese the cheese was not good quality .
the quintessential neighborhood low key late night fine dining feel like its part of soho identity .
ordered a pepperoni slice during a quiet sunday afternoon i was starving thankfully i received it in 5 min pizza its edible but the sauce needs work and personally the crust should be a little more crisp .
arrived on accident hubby and i thought this was blue ribbon sushi wanted to relive the experience discovered the difference the moment we entered but decided to stay who can resist the smell of fried chicken not i .
they take for ever and the order is never right ill go else where you should too .
expensive trendy and worth every penny i ordered the pigeon decided to try the local fare and it was delicious .
this place has horrible service dont ever order delivery unreliable and when you call to correct your order they will blame you and never refund or complete your order owner doesnt care about product or the customer stay away .
delicious and cool .
got pizza and wings delivered everything was cold and pizza was soggy i only live 3 blocks away .
beef marrow oxtail marmalade and the foie gras terrine were amazing the rack of lamb was a good follow up but just cant match the marmalade .
ate here based on other yelp reviews but i felt the quality and portion size was mediocre much better sushi to be found in the area .
i live in soho and this place opens at 4pm and you can still order dinner at 4am and eat fantastic food service is aces easy to park hey its like non other .
food was ok service was terrible ambiance was similar to a retirement home only one parmesan shaker had to share .
i go to this place when in nyc a great late night option if you want solid food with great service oxtail is a must have .
found a bug in my chicken ceasar salad .
the bone marrow and marmalade oh my goodness it was my first experience with bone marrow and im sold everything else we had was delicious too but i cant remember what i had because well bone marrow .
overall the food was ok there wasnt anything special about this place .
went here years ago but i still remember the meal at 2am it was fantastic even at 6pm it would have been too beef marrow oxtail marmalade was amazing as was the rack of lamb .
food was bland and the vegetables taste like they were frozen previously my plate was quite pricey for the fact that i couldnt even finish it all and threw it away .
this place is intimate and service was great the waiters are knowledgeable and the food was out of this world everything was so fresh i highly recommend the duck and fried chicken .
not impressed i was there saturday night later than usual servers were not friendly food was fair i will continue to find a good vietnamese restaurant in northern nj i was generally disappointed with my order of pho maybe off night maybe not there is better .
ate here the other night and it was fantastic we had the fondue and wings as appetizers i had the fried chicken for my meal probably the best in nyc staff was amazing and constantly taking care of us .
they have dead mouse and roaches in the restaurant omg never going there again filthy .
bone marrow spread it on your bread fried oyster oye oye oye spread that sauce on your bread too its good this place is da boooommbb .
horrible service i sat there waiting to be served for almost 20 mins i just walked out due to fraustration .
prong shrimp and bone marrow .
the atlantic sole was so covered in frying oil and cheese it was hardly recognizable as fish and for what they charge for desserts they could at least make the whipped cream from scratch instead of drowning a perfectly good brownie in cool whip .
when im in the village this is the place one of the reasons i miss new york when im not here .
great atmosphere but way overpriced for the portion size and food quality .
a great dining experience from start to finish couldnt be more pleased with the food or the service highly recommend .
cool theme i guess if you are into that stuff but not impressed with the food pesto seems canned and their fish tasted like it was coated in coffee i doubt they are farm fresh as the say tastes like restaurant depot aka bjs for restaurants .
great .
expensive and rather bland the mafia movies constantly playing is insulting to all .
a true west village gem nothing bets a 230am meal at blue ribbon with your buddies getting a reservation is tricky given the spontaneity of an early morning dinner the bone marrow is pure decadence and literally melts in your month .
i came here with several friends for an afterdinner coffee wed have liked to order dessert but the waiter was so put off that we werent ordering dinner that he never came back i wont be going back there .
bone marrow as my friend puts it taste like butter from the gods oysters are delicious friendly staff only thing i didnt like was hearing the conversation of the table next to us a little too close .
save your money and go elsewhere their chicken kadai tasted like sambar the chicken 65 was over fried and tasted like cardboard no salt even the roti was the only saving grace which got the 1 star will never go here again .
this place was amazing great late night spot with really good drinks and great food next time im in nyc i will go back .
nice atmosphere good service metiocre appetizers minuscule portions exorbitant prices after dinner we needed to go out to eat more and we are not big eaters very disappointing .
if nothing else try the bone marrow with oxtail marmalade appetizer i personally recommend the royal paella and lamb .
this restaurant is in a great location and the space is very well done looking forward to the next restaurant in this space after this one goes out of business for incompetent service .
the fried chicken .
went for dinner the other night and was not really impressed after hearing about the michelin star and the price i was expecting something else the lamb was cold and the portions were exceptionally small .
probably our favorite all purpose restaurants in ny steak tartar and chicken burgers are well worth the drive themselves .
a disappointment to say to the least pulled pork sliders were dry and the brioche french toast was awful i think marc forgione needs to taste his food before he serves it id go back for the blood orange mimosa and thats about it .
love this place best pirogies ever also try the fried chicken raw bar ny strip escargot pretty much everything is great no reservations for parties under 4 people the wait will be up to an hour during peak hours check it out .
they use a ton of styrofoam which i find perplexing given the restaurant is kosher and run by orthodox owners the food is great but the low star ranking is for my view that respecting animals is more than keeping kosher but also doing environmentally conscious business .
stellar meal late night eclectic and perfectly executed menu that gets you all tingly when you read it .
the place is pretty good but the guy who is always there acts like an ashole he doesnt know shit about being nice to costumers the food is pretty damn good but im not gonna come back here .
oysters and bone marrow is a ouu and ahh will be back again .
the prices arent bad but the quality is horrible somehow the rice was hard probably old crunching on rice wasnt pleasant .
cute american restaurant went with a small group of girlfriends and shared a few appetizers everything was great fondueyum beer tartare chicken wingscame with a small fire so you crisp your wings calamari dessert was very good as well i recommend the creme brûlée .
they seated other people before us even though we were there first the fish tacos were okay but there was too much tomatoes overall the experience wasnt worth the wait .
we are a party of 7 everybody loved the food return maybe frequency rarely .
not worth the wait they need to figure out a better checkinseating system food was ok nothing out of this world certainly not food you wait 1 hour for .
fried oysters and bone marrow were perfect waiters were attentive cramped but cozy great spot earned its namesake .
we just moved to philadelphia from europe have yet to find all our go to places and lets just say the search continues nice staff cute place good value byo but the foods meh .
open until 4am my love affair with blue ribbon continues on since 2006 the only thing i need when at br bone marrow foie gras mouth watering goodness .
small standard menu everything was priced up 24 dollars per item food was good but dinner prices for breakfast ugh i thought that it was good but hyped by all the reviews in all caps .
overall very good food in a laid back environment the menu is pretty expansive so youll be able to find something even if you dont know what you are in the mood for service was good i would definitely return .
just went no big deal but my lady likes it so well be back nice menu not too high on the venue but most are .
good service and the oxtailmarrow combo was perfection i ordered a drink that was disgusting and the waiter immediately took it back and erased it from our bill although it was a special drink i had asked for specifically we will absolutely return in a future trip .
rude and dont get the fascination with the food extreme uberhipster as well wont be going back .
the original and the best one of my all time favorites .
stupid sabrinas why are you soo cool with those darned hipsters their tight jeans and ironic tshirts hogging up all the tables so i cant have any food stupid sabrinas .
the food is incredible but the place is tooooo small very attentive and the staff accommodates to the needs of the customer .
hopefully by giving sabrinas one star i can a lower its rating which in turn b causes less people to come here which means that i can then c get a damn table on a weekend .
best pick for dinner in nyc in my opinion very intimate with a wide variety of menu choices fried chicken is the best ive ever had the real reason you are here however is for the bone marrowoxtail marmalade app .
like i wrote my review their foods are awesome but the service is horrible unbelievable they should definitely train their staff .
formula for success at blue ribbon raw bar bone marrow fried chicken i pity the fool who doesnt order the bone marrow the thought of that oxtail marmalade is making my mouth water .
i was hoping for more sea bass was overdone but the sauce was good the scallop appetizer was cooked well but 15 for three scallops come on crowded loud and service is soso needless to say i will not be returning .
wow amazing 100 am meal as everyone has said the oxtail marmalade was out of this world i wanted to lick the plateit was that good the rock shrimp appetizer was surprisingly good and i loved the fried chicken with mashed potatoes and collard greens .
your typical overhyped west village restaurant snobby over crowded i might as well been eating with the couple next to me the food was nothing special and the service was absolutely horrible i wouldnt go back and i wouldnt recommend .
the environment here is cozy its for sure a cool place to hangout and enjoy great food you must try the bone marrow it was spectacular better than most of the places that ive tried .
food was tasty but overpriced with small portions worst of all the service was very slow .
delicious every bite and wonderful service the native regulars are friendly i would come here often if i lived in nyc love .
wish i could comment on the food we were first in the door for sunday brunch only to be ignored by wait staff fifteen minutes later after everyone in the place had drinks and orders in we walked out they didnt notice .
is there anything more fun more ny than ordering steak tartare martinis and a lobster at 130 am and having said order be so delicious and being greeted by the hotness with nice to see you again mr last name redacted i love that .
the wait was kind of long too long for this place ther service was really terrible the waitress looked very bored annoyed she was working the food was just ok the rigatoni was tasty but the brussel sprout side was undercooked lacked flavor i wont go back .
scallops were divine had no problem getting a seat for 2 at 830 on a friday night no reservation dark atmosphere attentive service i would say this was a great date place .
great atmosphere but my omelets was definitely overcooked 2 5 stars .
dont be fooled by the menu the onion soup isnt just normal onion soup its a scrumptious french onion soup thats totally worth trying see a picture of it here omnomnotes blogspot com… .
great ambience cutesy and kitchy in the west village the food was soo soo i was still hungry from my salad the drinks were good tho its more of a scene than a place to appease your stomach its a place to be seen rather than satisfied .
my last meal on earth would be my usual at blue ribbon brasserie 1 half dozen oysters 2 bone marrow oxtail marmalade 3 duck a lorange 4 creme brulee .
i have to agree with the food reviews below but the service was horrible if it hadnt been for my amazing drink and sandwich for brunch i would not recommend this place .
wow awesome love the bone marrow catfish pigeon oysters bread and wine selection .
the worst hamburger i have ever eaten in my life beer is nine dollars in a warm glass .
yes great service and to die for food .
perhaps the worst mexican food ive ever had the salsa seemed like ketchup mixed with some onions .
northeast oysters are large succulent and have a great after taste also the malbec goes great with them .
i gave it a 2 for atmosphere but the food was gross and the place smelled .
very yum .
great service too bad the food is mediocre and over priced .
this was a great date night great staff and ambiance extensive wine list and excellent bread you must get the bone marrow it was out of this world as were the oyster selections both east and west coast selections mmmmmm i will go again foooooor sure .
all i will say about this place is that it has ruined any illusions i may have ever had of finding good authentic mexican food in union county nj thanks alot beanas .
an amazing late night dinner spot great service and atmosphere the app platter was really impressive but dont get it if you want real dinner its very rich and filling we left around 2am and people were flooding in the door .
lets get one thing straight beanas is not mexican food if you want real mexican food in rahway please visit la malinche by the train station beanas is more like a mom and pop chilis with bad salsa not recommended .
omfingg bone marrow gasp huge chunks of bone marrow and im in love ginza cocktail so delicious i had to get a second one surprising hint of horseradish in smoked trout salad well played blue ribbon well played .
classic dive bar experience cheap drinks and low key atmosphere the bartender bryan was a complete asshole and only paid attention to the people he knew at the bar got a beer and one shot and then left would have been better if the bartender was more friendly .
an authentic new york spot awesome service great food small dining room with a good buzz .
the absolute grossest people run this place is such a terrible shame since it should uphold its history .
delish delish bone marrow raw oysters everything was perfect and done very well the service was awesome the food was better period .
good place to visit on a hot sunny day because the customer service is as cold as their gelato its like they are bothered by your presence seriously get over yourself .
great bartender and delicious lamb chops oysters on the 12 shell were nice and briney .
the quality of the baked goods is nothing special but i will stop in to purchase cannolis which are filled on demand the sheet pizza used to be very good but i noticed on my last visit that it was not fresh .
this place is so so so so good thats all i have to say try it just try it .
i ordered onion and pepper pizza clearly over the phone when i got home i had olive and peppers yuk i hate olives i called and wouldnt even offer me credit or deliver me a new one ruined my new years thanks bar .
love this place so much great food and they stay open so late so i am able to have a good meal when i get out of work .
wore a tanktop was asked to put on a shirt or leave wont be coming back why dont they just hang a sign outside that says no gays or latinos seems like itd save them some time .
i dont understand the bad reviews and you wont either did i mention you can set yourself straight on this point at 300 am you can personal endorsements sweetbreads bone marrow oysters re visiting asap .
disappointing i came here after rave reviews the pizza was like warm at best when it arrived when we asked them to reheat it they pretty much said they couldnt do anything i will not be coming back pepes modern and sallys are much better .
its another late night in the city that never sleeps and you have a discriminating palate go ignore the weird 90s decor and focus on the food the bone marrow and oxtail marmalade are a must and the seasonal oysters are fresh and so tasty .
pizza good service terrible beer dirty and warm bring your poetry journal for a pseudo yuppie reading with theodore or chazz or some other dweeb in a corduroy jacket with elbow patches new haven is lame .
great food low key great to not need reservations but still eat well menu covers a huge variety great staff and service .
the pizza is good but why the hell do i have to pay cover if im just there to eat pizza with my pregnant wife never again lost our business .
i was happy that i found here at 352am for fresh oysters there was a line to get the table i sat at the bar with my friend and ordered a dozen of kumamoto 3 50 it was the best oysters so we ordered for another round .
good pizza but horrible service .
i love this place fried oyeters lamb chops and an awesome bottle of wine all available at 200 in the morning ive been going there for 10 years and it never disappoints .
been here twice when visiting new haven the locals seem to love it but every time i come its really slow terrible service and subpar food .
ate at a dinner party in the wine cellar a few years ago and was wowed with the wine food and service it was a wonderful fun night with amazing food .
went here to get pizza with a friend the service was okay and ive had better pizza .
my haiku review great place for a date the fried oysters are the best tapa in new york .
two hour wait for a party of 7 people still they couldnt promise a table we had to leave for another restaurant i give them a rating of one for very poor service .
simply my favorite restaurant .
their pizza is good their service sucks im not sure who picks the hostess but they have been consistently retarded they never know the appropriate wait time tried reserving 2 tables with the manager and to quote seinfeld he got the reservation but could not hold the reservation .
i mean is there something more to say this place has been rated the best sushi in nyc many many times for some good traditional japanese food and some sashimi that will melt in your mouth you must must go here .
worst service ever .
best raw bar the bartenders are friendly and attentive part of the reason we chose this neighborhood highly recommended .
the wait was ridiculous as they tried to shove a table of people out of the way for our group unfortunately they werent moving they still had a full pitcher of beer to finish and it was really rude just sit down at a table full of strangers .
the spicy seafood soup was amazing my roast chicken was awesome too didnt think it would be sliced but amazing nonetheless .
not sure what the rave is about definitely not authentic puerto rican food its a melting pot of all latin flavors if you want real boricua food try el palmar in elizabeth best food ever .
one of my favorite retaurants in the city definitly on my radar for a revisit .
im sorry but the 2 75 cinnamon swirl was small dry and bland and not fresh the coffee was decent barrio your customer service is okay and your coffee is good but you need to make the pastries bigger and more exciting .
pleasant dining experience altogether some restaurants make you feel like an idiot for spending that kind of money blue ribbonno albeit dinner was expensed .
dirty with lots of flies that was enough for me not to stay .
love it the best dish goes to beef marrow oxtail marmalade .
save your money and time go to big stashas on kearny ave they never disappoint .
really cool staff the place is tiny like many village joints i had fried chicken it was enjoyable beer selection was nice too for dessert we had the banana split good service .
i will occasionally stop in for a quick lunch but the thought of the unfriendly staff here usually keeps me driving on by lucys food selection is pretty basic salads pasta dishes of course some nice bread .
yum food grilled calamari must be tried .
unmemorable and unappealing food total identity crisis is it italian is it spanish not sure they know themselves noticeably indifferent service some menu items listed on the menu on facebook are not on the actual menu just not worth it .
the spicy tuna roll was pure pleasure for all my taste buds if the other rolls were geeks then the spicy tuna were studs great atmosphere they sat us quickly at the bar and the sake box was delightful they earned their 5 stars .
dry too much bread .
the piece de resistance is the beef marrow oxtail marmalade it is super decadent and delicious skip the bread basket and indulge .
horrible location horrible service horrible steaks id rather spend my hard earned money at one of the tourist traps then go back here be warned .
i came here drunk so this may be biased bonneee marrrroww not just hype its that good paella not so good fried chicken gooood what a lazy post .
so we went for dessert and i got the tartufo chocolate covered ice cream the chocolate tasted like the freezer its such a shame because there are so many yummy things too may not got there again .
servis was exsalent drinks where strong food was exsalent the beef marrow with ox t ail jelly app was amazing it is a must do .
fried and split weisswurst and overly salty red cabbage austrian home cooking my a this place is lazy and they dont seem to care that the cooks arent cooking the germanaustrian food correctly or even close .
i really like this place i went here for a late sunday dinner and the atmosphere was just chill not too busy so it was perfect had fresh oysters and fish soup and both were great service was excellent pricey but worth it highly recommended .
nice service had bad food beyond sausages i suggest you avoid the sandwiches .
i moved to soho at one point just to be close to br the bone marrow is out of this world .
food was incredibly bland chicken consomme was like water white bean salad no flavor meatloaf sandwich dry and flavorless the rye bread was the only thing with flavor .
fresh scallops and oysters marrow pigeon all at 3am what more can you ask for .
food was bland and disappointing i ordered the salmon with veggies there were 3 pieces of steamed broccoli on top of bland rice i would not go back there .
excellent excellent excellent oysters bone marrow skate and fried chicken just a great experience in a friendly relaxed atmosphere .
nice place rude people they really believe that the restaurant area is only for those who eat no matter how empty it is and how packed the bar area is so dumb .
where do i know benjamin from maybe the service is just sooo good that youll feel as though its a loving sibling hooking you up with all your classic favorites why not 5 stars well why was it 500 x .
caveat the central european experience is wasted on me not being much of a fan of the cuisine but the place was cheerful and popular and i did enjoy the chance to try a germanic amber quite different .
very very good food at blue ribbon it was high quality service and high quality taste i have only been to blue ribbon once but it was delicious good place for a business dinner or a date cant go wrong .
food was really not very good at all with the notable exception of the linzer tort which was wonderful even the goesser tasted off thomas beisl in fort greene is much much better .
completely loved this place a gem in soho great ambience fantastic food and service had the smoked trout and new york strip today and loved it .
the calamari used to come with an aioli and seasoned with a nice salt mix and fried to perfection no more the menu changed and seems so did the chef .
always a favorite of mine fabulous sweetbreads marrow oysters fried chicken and open late speaks my language .
overpriced average meals the sandwiches are mostly bread with a little bit of meat .
bone marrow and oxtail marmalade at blue ribbon may be worth breaking your new years resolution for .
would love to review the food but after waiting patiently for 15 minutes in an empty restaurant no one ever asked me if i wanted any .
unbelievably good .
food was ok service on the slow side .
blue ribbon brasserie was a hazy recollection of late night champagne raw oysters and bone marrow did i really have that honestly thats about all i can remember but those raw oysters were definitely worth going back for .
the most disgusting food ever i really cannot believe the guys that own this place would allow this food out for service seemed like the veggies were frozen the meat was dry and seemed frozen also only go to this place to drink .
had the fried chicken different mildly spicy even but very juicey plenty of pieces at a nice size fabulous chocolate cake dessert definitely plan on returning btw rsvp there is always a wait for this place .
the staff was friendly and foyne however food was pretty bland portions were not generous and you find out about the 10 card limit as they hand you the check .
seafood here is amazing it is top quality and super expensive i couldnt afford to eat here regularly but it is definitely a treat .
the food is awful 5 for tater tots are you people nuts you get a better burger at wendys for a buck and even chick filet dont charge 4 50 for a handful of cold waffle fries paper plates and plastic cutlery are not cool .
i went with my boyfriend at 3am and it was still delicious i absolutely loved the sauteed calamari we also ordered some wine oysters and ribs it was a very enjoyable meal small and cozy atmosphere staff is super friendly .
maybe the name shouldve been a giveaway but it wasnt maybe i went on an off night i dont know i just know the bar seemed tired it felt like i was hanging out at my loud annoying aunts house .
duck breast deliciouuuuuuuus my friends sweet and spicy catfish was pretty good too the service was excellent the people are friendly its a nice intimate setting love it .
this might be a place where you have to be drinking to like it i was very disappointed with my food order at first i thought the prices were fine until i saw the portion size way too small also i ordered soda and it tasted like radiation .
name another unpretentious nyc restaurants that serves caviar and bone marrow at 4am fantastic sweetbreads as well .
there are always a few badass types standing out front of this place which makes me not want to go here are you badass because you drink here because this place isnt badass .
absolutely amazing while mainly seafood they have an excellent selection of other choices the french onion soup was some of the best ive had in the city and the lamb chops were fantastic great atmosphere not pretentious at all but classy .
i used to like going here but theres something about the really dirty upstairs area that always scares me away the downstairs is much nicer if you go on a slow day or just get some take out .
what is the best restaurant in ny at 3 am it is blue ribbon a great place to wind down with a good solid meal after a long night out with friends .
delivery took forever .
very good food hard to get into at times reservations for 6 or more only open until 3 or 4 in the morning .
kitchen very slow waitress not very attentive chicken noodle soup mediocre at best would not recommend .
i take it back i heart blue ribbon brasserie especially at 3am when craving proper food and no waiting for a table when its this late the raw bar is fantastic any time of day .
the service is nice but the food was pretty blase i had a crock rice dish with mixed seafood it was filling but tasted like leftovers total tab for 2 before tip was 77 31 .
great atmosphere open late very good food and great service i love this place .
good appetizers terrible slow service on a monday night ordered the duck and it came out wildly dry and tasted awful as a result they need to take a lesson from pure thai in hells kitchen .
always good comforting food nice wines the oysters rock had the bone marrow and while it was a little too much meaty butteryness for myself i can see why others would love it calamari is tender good good and good .
terrible food i came here because i was invited the food was trash i had a burger terrible i had some tarot toots they were ok lemonade terrible the staff was cool as hell but i came to eat and the food was terrible .
always a wonderful time try to score a seat at the bar .
the foods are not bad the service is pretty good the price is expensive for the type of food they serve the place is stinky i spent 5 minutes in that place and came out smelling like i work there .
even though i enjoyed everything here oyster and more oysters are addictive yum i want to save this place for a late late night thats the true experience at this real gem of a brasserie .
disappointing lobster roll mostly shreds of lobster meat not many chunks watery and not much taste soup good but over priced it was our first time and will be our last .
the best of the best unpretentious service fantastic food new york hours 4pm4am this is where chefs come when theyre done work try the fried chicken which will change your life i myself rarely can get past the perfect summery lobster .
all i remember is average food and outrageous prices .
the food was good but i found it was the service was really outstanding magnus and ben were great maitres d .
this place is interchangeable with kens corner the menu has not changed in 25 years very greasy and not in a good way really there a better places in town .
cute lil place open late salmon lovesss it clams were good service was pleasant date was great ahah cute place def going again .
its ok not delicious overpriced and overly spanish if you are really hungry and the pizza place is closed go there .
nice vibe and fabulous latenite hours not exactly many vegetarian options as in far fewer than most places have but its still fun to enjoy a sit down with friends in the relaxed atmosphere service seems admirable too .
this place is closed .
cozy restaurant with good food and reasonable prices loved the catfish salads and fried oysters but was unimpressed with the calamari a nice downtown restaurant dont confuse it with blue ribbon sushi down the street good wine .
mexican food is my favorite but this place is so 0 110 the food is greasy the meat is like eating gum the guacamole is old i have never eaten such a bad food like in this restaurant .
open nice and late bone marrow appetizer cozy and great service did i mention the bone marrow appetizer yet .
its ok nothing special salt pepper goes long way try it guys .
love casual relaxed good atmosphere and good food .
the ambience of this place is slightly run down and the food is not fresh compared to chipotle right across the road however they do serve authentic mexican food dont even bother looking at the saucessalsa sampler kiosk if your tolerance for spice is low .
late night dining at its best honestly had a great experience oysters steak and a fantastic salad i was full for days but glad i got the chance to check it out i cant wait for my next trip back .
overpriced and extremely bad service did not have any many options and only 2 small baskets of chips and blad salsa for 9 people .
try the bone marrow appetizer delicious .
i give two stars because the food is outstanding but the service is terrible be warned if you expect the waitresses or cashiertake out staff to actually listen to what youre saying and actually get your order right you will be wrong again terrible service but great food .
blue ribbon has such great straight up american food not new american which is crap see xanga comfeedmoonbunny… for complete review with pictures i really wish yelp allowed pictures in reviews .
tried it again and it was worse than last time never again .
well i just got back from blue ribbon great dinner great service cute place im in somewhat a foul mood so i will keep this short go here you will love it if you like sea food ok bye .
this place was ok food ok but a little to pricey ive had better .
we will keep going back on busy nights it will take a while to be seated sometimes even if you have reservations but the service food are wonderful been here on plenty of late night dinners .
they will kick you out after 45 mins despite being a great patron who is planning on ordering a lot beware keep out at your own risk .
great food always packed 3 of us showed up here at 3am on a saturday night and still had to wait around 30 minutes for a table the chicken burger and roast duck club are superb as is the creme brulee .
rude staff over priced not good go elsewhere heard staff talking bad about other patrons while i was there bad vibes on bad times .
the food was amazing i know they have multiple pio pios but the city has way more options deff will eat here again .
dont believe the hype its a mediocretobad brunch and a cocktail list like no one tested the drinks for flavor throw in the cramped location and the expensive bill and weve got a let down of epic proportions .
big fan not having to deal with prefix alone on nye deserves the stars .
overpriced small portions physically its cute but not worth the money .
the atmosphere was great the food was delicious and the staff was very accommodating will definitely recommend and return again the paella was excellent .
cool decor surly servers hot food was mediocre .
went here for dinner on new years dont let the front fool you it opens up into a huge room with interesting decor staff was great and the food was exceptional green sauce is the best a great find .
hashbrowns were just terrible otherwise things were quite ok but ugh hashbrowns were so disapointing that i just dont want to ever go there again deep friend and just ugh .
the ceviche here is legendary huge portions of everything strong drinks and a good place for large parties .
the service was great our waitress was adorable and personable the bone marrow was disappointing not enough and served directly on oversalted overbuttered and over parslayed bread eh salad and cocktails were good not worth the crowds to try the other dishes .
good peruvian spot we shared the matador more than enough for 2 try the cristal beer its light smooth .
food is ok the help behind the counter needs some serious attention the deli people are very nice the cashier needs an attitude adjustment i have been in several times and she is always the same .
we sat at the bar and while the service was slow i think it was the bartender not the standard great place for happy hour upscale peruvian no twists great ceviche selection do over would be 3 ceviche dishes for the 2 of us and wine .
this place is over priced and disgusting i have given this place three tries and each time it gets worse and worse how are you going to charge 7 for arnolds bread and store bought lunch meat skip this place and save you money .
food portion is huge restaurant decoration is cool sangaria is tasty would like to come again for some special food .
every single time i eat here i get food poisoning skip it .
amazing tuna ceviche and pisco sours the service was great and the restaurants atmosphere was very romantic we tried the fried yucca as well but it was on the undercooked side and difficult to eat .
visited the downtown hartford location following on the heels of a prior disappointing visit bread was not fresh sandwich was made incorrectly and paid over 10 00 for the sandwich and drink will not be back .
very nice interior design and creative food loved the pepper icecream nice atmosphere .
this place is no longer in business or at least at the address specified here im really bummed since i wanted to try it we drove up and down the street four times before finally finding the building and realizing its not there .
amazing food pollo empanadas ceviche mixto were so delicious highly recommend this restaurant make reservations because they fill up quick .
by far the nastiest soul food place in connecticut perhaps u should begin with the fact that the mac n cheese is plain nasty please offer authentic food or none at all .
amazing scenery perfect place to take someone out on a date tentative staff as well place closes in an hour but its still packed and customers keep coming in get the pitcher of sangria its top notch .
hmmm its nothing special i have experienced better conceptually .
great quick service great quality food reasonably priced food with big size portions amazing sangria romantic but also fun vibe can come dine with anyone easy way to try peruvian food if youre a noob what more can you ask for .
terrible attitude i asked to be seated almost every table was empty but they said they would only seat me at the bar or an awkwardly located table right where everybody walks totally unaccommodating and uninterested in service .
rock solid the interior decor here reminded me of a restaurant in peru they probably had to chop down all the trees there to line the walls with twigs the appetizer sampler all tasted pretty good corvina a lo macho was amazing the octopus was especially good .
their grilled mushroom and stilton was delicious and the cappuccino holds up to the hype but customer service ordering receiving said order and the weird seating policy was a real turn off .
have been here several times recently was sad to hear that my favorite server talea was no longer there otherwise great food and fun ambience .
plain and simple i wouldnt go back not worth my time or energy wish someone would move into that location that really valued their customers and community .
this is definitely a family style restaurant every entrée that we ordered ended up humungous and filling we ended up having tons of food to take home a pitcher of sangria is a must too .
i really wanted to like atticus i have been there three times my most recent experience was so bad that i will never go back their customer service is horrible they are slow rude and perpetually confused and the food is inconsistent eat there at your own risk .
the food here is absolutely delicious perfect atmosphere for a group or a date would definitely come back here again .
boycott atticus for antiimmigrant attitude say no to their spanishonly policy for their workers .
noisy downstairs but food is amazing .
over rated its a nice place if you dont have a car and live downtown but there are better places around new haven for both books and food if you are willing to venture a bit on four wheels .
great portions and great flavor wish they had one in southern california ceviche de pescado was my favorite and true to real peruvian ceviche .
mediocre sushi not fresh tasting cashier doesnt know enough about the ingredients to advise customers correctly best offering is the steamed edamame beans for 3 25 in the refrigerated case when you first walk in .
went here for my 33rd birthday specifically for the interior architecture but i must say the food did not disappoint all of my friends had a real great time the drinks were amazing and the food delicsh .
this place is horrible i will never go back the food was gross and the servers were all watching nascar mike is like hitler as well if i could choose no stars i would .
great atmosphere food was good wait staff attentive i recommend it .
ive been to far better sports bars the food is expensive and just the normal stuff you find at a sports bar im not a fan owner is kind of full of himself if you ask me .
awesome atmosphere great food large portions friendly service left feeling satisfied .
weird combination of attendees food is pretty good the place has a weird smell and feels skeevy .
my new favourite place the staff was very hospitable careful and so friendly food was excellent fresh and tasty as peru i recommend you to have juicy chicken and salad and ceviche was tasty too i had a spicy margarita and it was supper .
come here for workday lunch a lot food is good while services are never good takes forever to order to get the check to get the change dinner dishes does not come with rice gotta pay 3 more bucks to get the rice ridiculous .
the atmosphere is great there was no wait for toe people party service was very attentive the calamari was definitely great to have and the drinks are very well done no complaints there .
i order kra prao moo krob over rice to go the meat is so dry and hard i will not recommend this dish .
the service cocktails and quality of food were all really great we started with the empanadas the mixto cebiche and the juanitas chicken would recommend all of the above the atmosphere was loud but not too much so .
the chili paste was not very spicy too sweet and overpowering in the pad led moo krob .
the food was great the environment was beyond my expectations .
food poisoning dont eat here i had the papaya salad which was not fresh and also had laarb gui had terrible food poisoning from this .
a bit loud and crazy busy but excellent service the food is delicious and despite how busy and crowded it was the staff was attentive and aware planning my next trip there as i type .
i have ordered many dishes from this restaurant to be honest it has failed me everytime i have no problem with other things like service or cleanliness but nothing tastes good here no more for larb ubol .
amazing decor splendid food would certainly go back to this place again .
they didnt have sriracha and the food was just ok .
meals are insanely big but delicious make sure you share also make sure you have a reservation its always crowded .
ehhhhhhhh not very thrilled being from the middle east myself i hate to say it but moaz has better falafel food looks like it needs cpr service was great .
friends and i craved for some peruvian food while working in new york we ordered the lomo saltado which was excellent and the chicken plate was amazing pair that with some savignon blanc and youre all set definitely will come back for more .
was kinda overpriced for the mediocre food we got i cant remember the name of it but i got this deep fried football looking thing 2 dinner platter and another dish i cant even remember the mint tea was not very minty .
pio pio is obviously known for their pollo a la brasa but everything tastes amazing the service can at times be slow but the ambiance and food is worth the wait i will definitely be returning soon .
was kind of put off when i got my grinder and found that the 12 inch sandwich doesnt come cut at all i asked if they forgot to cut it and they said no do you want a knife .
beautiful decor amazing staff and great drinks when it comes to dining in midtown this is the place to be i usually have the matador and the sangrias are amazing you will get drunk off a pitcher of sangria even shared by three people this place is great .
the employees here hate their jobs and it shows they will not make burritos after 8pm and thats the best thing they have they wrap the burrito in foil then heat it up so much it melts through the plastic take away bag .
the chicken is amazing found the kenyan special dish mogo fried yuca .
management needs to determine when to give people the bums rush when dining there and when to treat people properly never patronize them .
nice culinary experience the food was tasty and well presented the interior decoration of the restaurant is quite uniqueoriginal and contributes to the escape the only problem is the noise level the music is so loud its really hard to hear each others when hanging out with friends .
like most of staten island a strange guidoish hole out of 1990 .
i would take an airplane back to ny to eat at pio pio restaurant chains sigh if im not wrong i remember being at their 1st restaurant in qns too bad the west coast la too doesnt have the variety and richness of food like ny does .
antoinette opened this bar to serve drinks to her friends their food is disgusting the bar has manhattan prices with old men singing depressing songs no motivation to be a great bar in an upcoming neighbourhood depressing expensive and troll women stay away .
food quantities are huge each entrée was big enough for 3 people the tamarind pisco cocktail was nice and strongly alcoholic .
worst service in the world if i could give them a zero i would they cancelled by eid catering order 30 mins before i was supposed to pick it up .
bes peruvian food in the city the matador dish is amazing because you get to taste a bit of everything and the portions are big service is fast love it .
only the naan and kabobs are made fresh everything else is stale food that is heated in a microwave and served service is horrible .
classic peruvian dishes are on point pricing is slightly higher than other peruvian restaurants but the atmosphere is also a lot more formal than other restaurants definitely worth checking it out .
the food is good a very major problem is that they dont clean their restaurant its very dirty and the staff doesnt care my last visit i saw a cook smoking in the kitchen i approached the manager and he did not care never going back .
ive been to this restaurant only ones and the i order the rice with beans and chicken and it was great but better then the chicken was the price highly recommended .
service was painful while i watched management joking around while i watched my ice tea sit in window until ice was melted my burger was ordered medium rare but sat in window so long i received it well done .
favorite pio pio location in manhattan large inviting restaurant with really great food although ive explored their menu over the years my goto dishes are still the chicken rice avocado salad and of course lots of the green sauce .
disappointed is the way id sum it up got the burger of the month canadian burger canadian bacon white cheddar maple mustard ordered medium came out gray and dry redeeming factor plenty of cheese wont go again burger alone 9 00 .
best peruvian restaurant in town i always get either the ceviche limeño or the mero norteño you cant go wrong with either .
heard all the hype about bobby flays burger joint dont believe the hype the burger was dry and had no taste at all if you look beyond the fancy sauces chipotle ketchup and comfy seating youll find a regular burger joint .
great food and a nice atmosphere but too loud food is awesome and they give plenty of it you wont be able to have a conversation but you will surely have good food .
not worth any of the hype or the money i ordered the philadelphia burger i think ive eaten better burgers at backyard bbqs a delicious strawberry milkshake average sweet potato fries and excellent service .
came here last saturday with my husband and two friends we all loved the food excellent service and a warm and happy ambience must try jalea and ajo verde green sauce chicken chinese fried rice and corvina a lo macho great peruvian resto .
the 1950s called they want their portion sizes back .
the chicken is divine thank you for the great hospitality everytime i go to nyc i make it a point to dine at pio pio .
ive eaten at his restaurants in both atlantic city and las vegas and wasnt impressed by either one of them heres the breakdown bunboring nothing special about it meatnot very well seasoned and pretty boring toppingsnice choices which keeps it from being a one starq .
check out my blog for my review on this restaurant craftytaramarie wordpres… .
just bland way overpriced and overrated there is absolutely nothing special about this place and i would avoid eating here again .
always consistent remains a solid choice one of my fave spots to dine at hands down great for groups great food absolutely delicious great service always seamless never any issues eat here multiple times a years been back several times this summer already love it .
cant bobby flay find room in his tiny little heart for a veggie burger .
excellent food and good service not a loud atmosphere either it was pleasant good for a date night .
the burgers are boring dull and flavorless skip this place and find a better burger spot the atmosphere was fun but do you want to pay all that money to be sitting in an ultrahip macdonalds no you dont .
delicious food with yummy ingredients chicken so perfectly cooked decent wine selection great desserts great service yum .
i frequently have cravings for vanilla carmel bourbon milkshakes after my first experience though i could probably make it at home and save 8 and a trip to west philly .
delicious food i loved the avocado salad and wish roasted chicken tasted like this all the time service was friendly and attentive the ambience is great i loved the beautiful twig wall coverings and decor .
crunchified burgers were way too salty fries were okay shake was okay overall meh would not make an effort to try this place .
made an reservation it was easy and quick perfectly seated the service was great food was amazing only complaint was the loudness i dont know if it was the walls but it seemed like an amplifier in there it was hard to hear and converse with my friends .
all image no content trying to cash in on the hipster burger joint vibe but not quite pulling it off the food was totally boring but not actually offensive and would do in a pinch if there werent so many other better places within a block or two .
very good food and perfect for big parties loved the chef dessert selection and the tuna tartare with avocado the chicken is amazing too very tender will come back soon .
totally thumbs down expected better our burgers la dallas and kids were dry salty and overcooked service was friendly but our table smelled mildewy and sticky .
the food was great and the prices are reasonable everything tasted delicious and the restaurant set up is beautiful i cannot wait to go back here .
the miami burger is fine as is the napa burger dont try the classictoo much cheese american service was very friendly but the place has the feel of a fastfood restaurant you walk in stand in line order your food and then good luck finding a seat .
this place is fantastic great looking design friendly staff and incredible food their ahi de gallina is the best ive ever had and the rest of our meal was delicious as well i highly recommend pio pio .
give it two stars because 1 good service and 2 kinda fun but the quality of the food seafood is really bad thats all maybe now is the the right season .
this place is the bomb com .
the worst food possible 1 food sucks 2 service sucks 3 only cash wtf food was overcooked with no taste what so ever its like here what ever the waitress was a straight up bxtch i will not b back here for sure .
a very tasty dinner we had the ceviche and lomo saltado both were very good as were the cocktails service was good and we left happy and full .
i i come to at least 2 to 3 times per month i am appauld at the service that was given today i was totally disrespected and disregarded i use to highly recommend the boil to friends and family never ever again .
i love this place its great for large parties and its huge the decor and atmosphere is beautiful the chicken is delicious huge and amazingly good i will definitely be coming back .
terrible service food may be good but they treat you like a garbage i wanted to stay at the bar and wait for the table when the waitress said to bartender make sure they wont sit down i let you judge it yourself .
i loooovvveeee this place the food and the environment is amazing everyone should try the lomo saltado best one i have ever had you need to make reservations to get a spot on the weekend .
really disappointed it is not tasty and very expensive actually the special garlic sauce is delicious but the seafood itself does not absorb the sauce we will not return in the future .
good sangria empanadas and ceviche together with sidewalk seating on a nice day generous portions and reasonable prices especially by new york standards as well .
two words food poisoning after what was admittedly a fantastictasting meal the shrimpcrawfish boil in the everything seasoning i spent the evening painting a bathroom stall in the bowery ballroom with the contents of my stomach ugh .
this review is for their rotisserie chicken only it was dlicious i had take out .
if youre looking for true louisiana style crawfish do not bother coming here the boil serves west coast style seafood that has been popularized by restaurants like the boiling crab no cajun is eating boiled crawfish covered in butter lemon and garlic .
these guys are brilliant at chicken that is their main selling point other items and sangria are also good service is ok not great and decor is quite nice but yes fantastic chicken .
i think i choose the wrong date to try in the boil the seafood is not fresh and the corn was so dry also i think they put a lot of msg you cant stop drink water anyway this will be my first and last visit .
must experience green sauce was the best chinese rice couldve been a little better location was very nice sangria is a must try .
looks like ownership changed again there is something missing in service and the food is very spicy and creamy will never go to this place again .
best peruvian restaurant i go there very often highly recommended .
tried them two times as takeout and the food quality was not to my liking there are several indian restaurants within a 5 mile radius that serve quality food and offer a clean and pleasant atmosphere .
pio pio is amazing i went for my birthday dinner with a group of about 10 and it was perfect the food was so tasty and my friends now say they want to have their birthday dinner there one downside is that it could get pretty noisy .
rude staff dirty dishes for a vegetarian buffet go up the road to mylai masala for a much better non vegetarian buffet and courteous staff go to tandoori bite in princeton you wont regret it .
delicious delicious delicious the chicken and green sauce is obviously where its at and the dessert platter was amazing not the kind thats half great half awful steer clear of the paella though the shellfish was overcooked .
food ok not much choice not worth 12 maybe 8 it is more of lower end food was ok but not lots of flavor a bit amateurish surprising given area has many good places just happened to be in area and stopped .
loved the food and atmosphere service was also good very reasonably priced we got the combo and it was perfect for two people arriving at 545 on friday night no problem getting in place was full by 615 i will definitely come back .
not good mexican save your money .
large portion and good atmosphere recommended roasted pepper with lamb for appetizer .
go to ay salsa la cosinitas chicken mole made both me my mother and other guests horribly sick the server is nice and the place is friendly but the food is awful there are many other restaurants in new haven that offer good mexican food .
what a great place to eat the chicken was superb rice and beans and the maduros were yummy and the sangria was off the chain i will be back on my next trip .
are you serious id take taco bell over this any day went there based on review thanks guys .
fun place for a group make a reservation ive been to two birthday parties including my own and had a great time order for sharing and youll have a blast i had the steak dish and the cold potato appetizer highly recommended also get some sangria yummy .
ordered the deep fried snapper and pad thai for delivery it took over 1 hour to be delivered i live in bloomfield wth the fish was not seasoned and the pad thai was salty the shrimp were spoiled just very sloppy never again .
great food great service never had a bad meal here if you like margaritas try one with pisco .
26 gai yang boneless chicken breast marinated with thai herbs and chefs bbq sauce served with mixed greens boiled salty chicken breast with side of hot sour sauce on 1 leaf of iceberg lettuce .
so good .
sorry i tried to like this place the chicken cutlet parm was horrible the sauce was watery the chicken was tough the ziti was bland i guess i have to try the deli sandwiches .
this is such a sexy place the ambience is a big plus and the sangria too the food is a little on the expensive side but its worth it i need to know whats in the green sauce .
horrible .
love the food and the ambiance if u wanted a mixed seafood appetizer go for the jalea its a mix of fried calamari yuca octopus scallops etc the ceviche mixto is my favorite .
it still sucks .
amazing cocktails and amazing food try their muddled pisco with strawberries shots amazing .
i know princeton natives will rave about this pizza but sorry its horrible .
what an amazing place the peruvian cuisine is wonderful celebrating our anniversary here we will be back get here early it gets busy great food and service .
if you call burned cracker topped with grease a pizza please come enjoy contes .
i love this place and their amazing food there plates are huge so i always take food home the waiters are very nice and the ambiance is quiet if your going out on a date great place .
never go to this restaurant again i waited for the pick up food for over 30 min service is horrible and terrible .
hi excelleny food ambience and lots of space went on monday not busy but service could have been more timely but definitely friendly .
good food but bad services they charge me 15 tips for taking out services how ridiculous i even didnt sit there thats so bad so i give them two stars .
best peruvian food i have had in a long long time hands down the lomo saltado a little pricey but worth every penny i would come back anytime im in nyc choros a la chalaca is a must .
ordered online waited an hour called them and they had no order from me dont order online from this place food never came .
super friendly service ambience is very cozy i went with some friends we ordered a pitcher of sangria better good fried seafood platter was huge the rotisserie chicken was typical rotisserie chicken cold seafood cevicha was good pickled style fried plaintains were delicious the paella was just okay .
food was okservice was very sporadicair cleaner near door was annoyingly noisy .
great vibe great food and great sangria could be better priced but overall great enough that i wont knock it really enjoyed the ambiance .
way over priced for what they offer plan on paying extra for things like jelly on toast dont ask for a napkin and a credit card minimum you are much better off going to clairs corner copia for true food at a reasonable price .
this place never fails i love the bomb ass chicken here the green sauce is like crack highly recommend no free refills on the 5 sodas though .
rude manager .
great food great atmosphere love the building inside its like a cave but very comfortable prices are decent for the city .
too pricey for the quality where is the value also the employees are pretty rude sometimes this place is good in a pinch but thats about it .
the chicken was juicy and fluent it was little bit salty thou anyway service was pretty good and nice decoration on the floor and walls .
disappointing came for dinner and had the worst service ever would ask a waitress a question and she wouldnt directly answer it and wander off and disappear for the next 30 minutes not even following up .
great food and ambience my girlfriends and i had a great time there before we went to watch a broadway show the plates were big and the flavors were huge we were so surprisingly satisfied and everything was so tasty i will definitely go again .
ive learned my lesson finally never go back to a restaurant you went to over 10 years ago in nyc it happened with basta pasta now yakitori totto they specialize in chicken dishes and they were the worst dishes i think dessert was the best enough said .
great food and great service tacu tacu was very tasty .
horrible service rude people they literally rush you out before you even finish your fooddrinks never coming here again .
love this place so many memories great ambiance a little loud for an intimate dinner but perf for night out great food .
bad service try explaining things to them and youll wanna pull your hair out too they speak english but cant comprehend my co worker and i wanted separate receipts not split the bill not accommodating at all i hope they hire a manager soon .
ive been to the smaller locations but this one is huge two floors the decor is beautiful service was fast and the food was delish .
food was really good the hostesses attitudes were less than desirable in fact after we left we realized we were charged for multiple items that were never served to us i was going to call them but preferred not to interact with them again .
great service delicious fried yuca and ceviche beautiful interiors definitely recommend .
food was ok really nothing special we had about 7 items what was most striking was how expensive it was our bill for 2 people all yakitori was 93 and we werent even full they also charge for tea refill beef tongue in particular was very tough .
delish everything thats all u need to know the restaurant looks nice inside too good food good setting good experience .
tasty but overpriced my lime sake cocktail was a bust and grilled rice ball came on a stick but many dishes were delicious the same people run totto ramen which i think is a better deal .
excellent food good service interesting decor much bigger than it looks from outside great for groups highly recommended .
i am not sure if i will come to this place again dont order the noodle coz the taste was just ok the chicken and pork are good and delicate it is overpriced in total the waiter was kind of rude to us and made me feel uncomfortable .
this review is based on delivery orders they are fast and efficient the food is always hot when it arrives i ordered from this place several times and the food is always good and consistent .
i dont get the buzz i really dont i got their 30 minute to prepare rice dish it was so average i didnt even know what to think id much rather go to a yakitori place on st marks .
the two different ceviches were amazing the chicken was a bit dry but still good their unique green sauce goes well with many different foods their rice and beans were a bit bland but still tasty in general satisfied .
we were first in line and even with getting a taste of everything we will never return there employees were rude and the food had no flavour enough said .
loved it .
decent food but rude staff totally out shadows the food go the one of the other 38 italian places within a 10 block radius that have great food and great service .
order the matador combo thats it very tasty chicken huge portions of delicious sides that you can easily share with 23 others service is good and very fast the general atmosphere is also very nice .
the food was good waitress and staff seemed to not care about how we wanted our food cooked its a big city but i will definitely not be eating here again .
just got delivery here and im hooked food was fresh and tasty got chicken tons of flavor salad beans for 3 great value for 23 bucks green sauce is amazing on chicken or salad def worth a try .
i came here based on the reviews ambience was nice but the food wasnt spectacular and its overpriced .
love it here lomo saltato .
horrible experience going there the waiter was a mess it was really bad food was alright but the serve really small portions .
amazing peruvian food ambiance is great service is very good i recommend the ceviche causa de pollo purple corn tamal lomo saltado of course the famous rotisserie chicken enjoy .
delivery is fast and internet ordering worked well food is dreadful barbecue chicken wasnt barbecued but grilled and then drowned in cheap sauce calzone was mediocre bread and stringy low quality cheese gyro may not have been lamb and wrong sauce fries werent bad .
ive been twice and if i find myself in midtown this would be my go to restaurant great food great used liberally fast service and great environment .
first time last time ordered an original thin crust with prosciutto and mushroom cardboard would have offered a more sophisticated flavor profile never again .
great food cheaper price had dinner with my friend on thursday everything was wonderful busy place .
oh brothers dont bother bad bad pizza .
hungry travelers looking for hispanic flavors rejoice this place has an amazing arroz chaufa and ceviche you will see more of this latino every time im in town .
very average pizza aljons down the street is much better .
all is good the ceviche is amazing the service ok but i dont know why they dont have a clear sign is so difficult to find .
nothing quality here lot to be desired for food quality and service the soup was the saltiest dish ive ever tried to eat .
a bit busy but the ripe plantains chicken and strong sangria made all the trip worth it excellent ambience great place to bring family friends for dinner and even a place for a date night .
whenever i go through the drive thru they can never get my non complicated order correct i always check it before i leave the parking lot .
extremely busy during dinner hours in weekend especially decent dishes and prices restaurants interior design is great as well worth visiting .
have to agree with the others that dont love the bagels was a bit disappointed since i stopped there thinking it was a speciality place for bagels the bagel was just too much soft dough the creamcheese light was overloaded .
was skeptical about trying peruvian but am sooo glad we stopped here for lunch it was delicious would suggest it to anyone .
this was my first visit they offer a large selection of bagel flavors i got an everything with lite plain cream cheese the bagel was fine it tasted fresh i was hoping for a latte but they only have the premixed machine so i skipped it .
delish food great atmosphere highly recommend .
unfriendly staff with sour looks on their faces the bagel i had was passable but the cream cheese tasted bad definitely stick to burlington bagel on shelburne rd .
atmosphere good enough eventually its a wednesday night empanadas were good loved their sauce would recommend this place for drinks next time ill try their matador combo it sounded really good .
i was not impressed with the bagels at all not chewy outside and not soft inside .
have been here four times and the place never disappoints the chicken and the sauce are so yumm the place can get tooo noisy .
this place is so confusing and complicated to navigate through that you need to be a tourist to actually have the kind of time it requires .
great place for lunch we ordered the juanitas chicken the fried seafood combo just order half portion is very large and 2 orders of empanadas for 4 people we were stuffed empanadas were awesome .
over it this place was interesting at first but now its just a clogged mess of tourists and overpriced offerings on top of that the service in the restaurants inside is typically awful .
awesome chicken remember to ask for the green sauce .
the ambience is great but the food is overrated really ordinary taglietelle and although the place was packed i believe it has become too touristy and lost its quality its all about quantity now and thats sad well located but missing that xfactor .
excellent service great food and wine pairing will look very much forward to going again .
one of the newish ninthcircleoftouristhellholes in flatiron there goes the neighborhood which is too bad because the park next door was so nice and relatively free of tourists avoid this overcrowded overpriced tourist trap at all costs except if you need to make a pitstopbathrooms by the books .
great place for big groups good food that can please most palates without being too expensive the hells kitchen location has a better space .
cannolis were soggy putrid the bread was too dense slightly stale overpriced its more like a walmart type quality with exorbitant price tags .
one of the best peruvian fusions in town chaufa lomo matator salchipapas sangria i can go on for a while you get the point atmosphere can be overwhelming at times but nonetheless great food .
i do not think we have ever encountered ruder employees ever we sat down at the counter to eat and the guy says you have ten minutes to order food or you have to move ummmm would never go back here .
super delicious my first experience with peruvian food was a great one .
too expensive tiny portions this review applies to manzo section main course with 3 scallops was 30 ended up going to halal cart for 5 lamb chicken and rice platter afterward with girlfriend to fill ourselves up will not go again .
happening place awesome food get a reservationweekends tend to be busy .
awful service i came with a group of friends to have wine and was asked to leave the table because we were not ordering food both heather and diego m are disgraceful my firm often uses eataly for our dinners never again .
food was delicious we got the matador combo and i was stuffed theyre sangria was pretty good too will definitely return .
this place is an atrocity .
the decor is really nice but its a bit noisy the food was excellent we were three and we shared the peruvian chicken rice beans french fries and avocado salad i recommend this place for there amazing chicken with the good green sauce .
never go to birreria unless you are stopped at the door by the most unreasonable square receptionist who would rather lose patronage than seat 8 people out of a party of 9 absolutely absurd and not worth the grievance attitude or subpar quality food .
great food interesting decor .
crazy inflated prices even for nyc you would think the owners could afford to pay their taxes and not steal tips from their employees or keep old ladies as slaves what a disgrace .
fabulous food service and ambience every selection was delicious and elegantly prepared very romantic and memorable .
very beautiful and great concept however the customer service was absolutely horrible no one willing to help me with olive oil the people working there are clueless mario get some people in there that want to be there and help your customers .
this restaurant has great service and great food camarones picante and the avocado appetizer were fantastic a definite favorite to return to .
too expensive worst experience ever no customer service .
great for a date night delicious food the lomo saltado and sangria are must haves .
had dinner in rossopomodoro pizza was ok and the food was good pasta too raw dente and more bread wasnt fresh eataly is a good place for shopping good quality of products made in italy .
i always get the jelea and the red sangria best in the city in my opinion only drawback is that this place can get very loud .
the decaf i head here had no flavor not much better than instant coffee the market and restaurant look very interesting i hope the food there tastes better than my decaf coffee .
dinner was great but their need to improve their service .
came here at lunchtime walked around and left too busy and chaotic .
one of my favorite places to be the good is amazing as well as the ambiance i love this place chicken is incredibly moist the rice is soft and filled with flavor very romantic dimmed lights and unique interior .
love the concept and it is pretty cool at first glance but then you realize its just a very crowded very touristy overpriced grocery store .
ive been here twice now get the chicken its a classic .
this is a cool place and a big ripoff we saw a bottle of olive oil that we normally purchase for 12 for 19 14 for a very cheap pour of an italian liqueur you get the picture .
you know the food is good when there is no talking between meals the pitcher of sangria oh you have to try the matador combo great for 3 or more people .
very crowded so difficult to find your way get a place .
great service and sandrias food is good .
super pretentious place horrible vibe and aura throughout it just screams money money money .
they have the best peruvian chicken in the city they also have the biggest range of pisco sour cocktails and are all very delicious the restaurant is big and the ambience is very lively i have enjoyed it everytime i have dined here .
sorry but this is a completely overpriced tourist trap no real new yorker would ever come here and spend that kind of money seriously you can get anything that is sold here anywhere else for a lot less money no just say no .
mandator combo is too much for two .
i think it is overrated i had a gelato sorbet that was way too gooey and sweet furthermore there is almost nowhere to sita few uncomfortable bar stools looks fancy but i get the sense that its much ado about nothing .
chicken was awesome ordered full chicken with side of rice and beans to share like i said chicken was awesome .
ew not impressed always so crowded and expensive got a piece of fish which came with the whole head on mouth open horrible ssooo many bones in it small as needles basically unedible was such a waste wont go back .
i love this place every time that i have to go to the city i stop by this restaurant rotisserie chicken my favorite lomo saltado is so good many many dishes to choose from .
the restaurant on the roof is very pretty but i left a very generous tip over 20 and then when i checked my statement they added even more to my bill not good not good .
great ceviches .
not impressed at all especially by cafe there bad food overpriced .
even something as seemingly basic as an empanada will blow you away their prices are very reasonable too def recommend .
overrated and overpriced i walked away very disappointed .
huge in size indeed .
yawn are people still really clinging to the idea that getting into an over packed place with long wait times even with reservations snotty staff medicre food at high prices and batali branding is exciting 1998 is over folks yawn .
the decoration is amazing food is within expectation side dish is great .
i love italian food this was a big disappoinment went with two other friends and we all came disappointed over price for no reason i gave it 2 stars because our waiter was great and so was the wine .
busy busy busy authentic delicious and big portion food friendly staff and fancy place .
overpriced and crowded plus rude service and scary pickpocketers mario sure know who to hurt people in the pocket book and more hes one walking commercial wish we avoided this place .
the green sauce is so good its insane the decor is awesome feels like youre in a rainforest a classy rainforest and the prices are so great the service can be slow though .
if you like waiting forever 1 5 hours to get seated then come by and try to dine just dont be hungry when you get here the food was good but no better than another good italian restaurant come for the experience and experience a 1 hour wait .
one of my favorite restaurants i love the green sauce the peruvian combo is a great deal .
seemed like ny encapsulated too crowded too loud too confusing im sure their stuff is good and there is a ton of it but it is overwhelming .
great food great drinks great atmosphere do yourself a favor and eat here especially if youve never had peruvian food everything i had was great .
hmmm not sure what the hype is its above average fare over the top prices if youve got nothing better to do with your money this will work for you .
great food great service great new flavors great scott just go now .
crowded and overpriced not worth the visit .
absolutely love the roasted chicken enough for 2 people definitely make a reservation would go again .
i ordered a take out margarehita pizza pie it was soggy had only one small sad basil leaf but the take out box was first rate at 14 for 4 slices you are paying for the box go to grimaldis at the limelight instead .
good spot to bring folks too and the food is yum its huge portions so theres a lot of sharing .
so gave it another go but still baffled by a place where its impossible to quickly grab a sandwich for lunch i still call it confusion short of the coffeeice cream bar the layout is a mess .
ceviche at pio pio is the best try the peruvian beer with ceviche mixto or corvina a la macho tried the chk empanadas and they were good too very good food all around but service is slow ambiance is cool and def inviting .
if you like hot chocolate that tastes like a giant hershey bar was put into a mug and zapped in the microwave come here and order it but be prepared for the runs you will have later .
will be my goto place every time i visit new york all the food is so flavorful and they give large portions i love their green sauce .
meh if i lived here in the city id probably come here to shop for special occasions pizza was below par cheeseplate was below par gelato was inedible i wouldnt go back second star was because service was great .
obsessed this is the nicest location and the food is awesome ambiance is great too a musttry .
the food was good going down but a few hours later my sister and i discovered we had food poisoning from my prosciutto sandwich .
great value for your money portion sizes are bigger than you expect wine list is short but does the job interesting that they have a cab franc from a long island vineyard on there and its not bad service was also prompt and friendly .
this place was very nonmemorable while the concept was a great idea the execution reminds me a bit of a cafeteria meets grand central station .
solid peruvian food i still missing the other option on 9th ave farmers rotisserie which i used to order from all the time so pio pio has to now fulfill my craving .
eataly is too big overwhelming and expensive for what you get especially since you always have to navigate crowds of ogling tourists additionally the whole checkout situation is annoying and ill conceived .
amazing tender chicken and the sauce rocks .
this place was close to my old office so ive tried nearly everything in there and its all just ok the crazy atmosphere takes it down further overpriced and not that authentic .
delicious chicken green sauce good for groups .
this place is thunderdome .
me three girlfriends and i shared the matador combo with two sides of the steamed vegetables salads two desserts and a bottle of wine all for under 34 per person not only was the food great but the price was incredible .
overpriced 16 pasta for lunch i dont think so the place is extremely crowded the staff is semihelpful and the food is subpar .
what can i really say that hasnt been said already food rocked service could have been better had the giant chicken platter thing and some some shrimp thing im stuffed out of my mind yummy .
so packed you feel like an idiot trying to get groceries all the mushrooms all the cheese all the olive oil nice but you can get that elsewhere for the same price without having to be shoved around by snobby tourists beautiful interior though .
stopped by today to order the whole chicken for 12 00 for takeout they gave me 3 containers of green sauce so nice and juicy .
do not come on the weekend you will not get anything you want i am sure this place is great when half of the un is not here gelato was good sandwiches were average .
food was good the chicken was really tender and the green garlic sauce was amazing place was packed and you wouldnt be able to get a table without a reservation lots of birthdays and atmosphere was very lively .
this place had beginners luck for me now that its been open for a while i give it 2 star rating and quality and staff quality have gone down it will still probably continue to be a tourist trap though .
the chicken ceviche mixto and lomo saltado are especially excellent its a chain and it isnt that expensive but its actually one of the best ceviche restaurants in manhattan enjoy .
cant share the pasta bc it compromises the presentation it is pasta which was made to fill the stomach of poor people get off your high horse .
excellent pio chicken juicy chicken meat they gave a lot of food for the money service very fast and professional .
nice concept but very crowded and expensive bad pizza .
great ambiance and delicious food whoever described the lomo saltado as out of this world delicious in their review was spot on its what i order every time im here the sangria is delicious as well this is currently my favorite peruvian restaurant in the city .
good place for tourists .
2 words green sauce .
i stopped in and bought a roasted chicken when i got home i realized the chicken was not fully cooked the wings still have some feathers on them i then cooked the chicken and when i cut into it there were many fatty deposits .
dine here all of the time nice decor very roomy accept reservations and have outdoor seating the sangrias and the matador combo are delish and the tres leches dessert is to die for the service however could be a bit better .
this place is overated and overpriced food layout is nice and is imported from italy but its very crowed and loud .
pio pio is always great i had never been to this one before and i was not disappointed walked over here after a show and im so glad i walked a few blocks to get away from all of the touristy overrated and overpriced touristy restaurants .
a great number of products that is if you can actually find them with the confusing layout of the store and mobs of people hopefully when the hype dies down it will be actually worth it to visit again .
its a lot bigger than it looks from the outside the food was great and staff was attentive great spot to have dinner with friends or family .
i know this just opened and come back to review when it dies down but as of now i am staying far far away from this nonsense way too crowded and you can hardly move its like going to a nightclub with tons of kids families and tourists .
just give up on life if you dont appreciate their chicken and ceviche bar to the maximum .
this rating is done based on lavazza latte machiatto it was steamed milk with a hint of coffee not even good steamed milk disgrace .
firs peruvian food experience and now im hooked extensive menu and delicious ceviche .
yelp says it all meh ive experienced better the food was overly seasoned service was poor the table was dirty but they nailed the authentic feel of the dishes ill give it another go in a few months .
great venue and great food a nice romantic dinner or just fun times with friends .
not bad good price .
nice atmosphere the matador combo is such a deal its really all you need to order for a few people .
i ate there a few times but no more the staff smoked in the back outside with the smoke wafting in the won ton is hard in general the food is not to my liking .
spent 5 hours dining here with my bff without being rushed food great sangria awesome trendy without being snobby the place is huge love places like this .
their pizza pie is no good the crust is paper thin and the sauce isnt even red it is orange whatever they put on the pizza but it dont taste like tomato sauce i wouldnt recommend it go to vitos in pennington on n main st excellent .
i was here with a colleague and we had a wonderful dinner with ceviche lomo saltado and pisco cocktails the variety of pisco options was lovely so was the ambiance and the service i would go back especially for more ceviche .
had burnt ribs i sent it back and got more burnt ribs if theyre going to charge this much for food on faded plastic nfl plates i expect juicy ribs .
my goto place for a large group food was consistently great every time i went i can always rely on pio pio to serve amazing food and have enough space for 10 people note family style is a must dont expect anything otherwise yay im a fan .
very small place the food is overrated .
delicious food and drinks beautiful atmosphere make sure to sit in the lower level friendly attentive staff .
overpriced fatty not flavorful bbq at least its a cheapo happy hour up in there if you can stand the douches .
so good no joke i daydream about returning to pio pio and ordering their half chicken with plantain maybe the best chicken i have ever had in my life strong possibility their drinks are really well made as well strong but tasty love this place .
first time at baby blues bbq on weds big disappointment brisket plate was tasteless but tender honestly my brisket is better ask my son who was with me mashed potatos were soupy and no flavor beans were just ok will i go back maybe .
wait let me open my pants omgggg my food was sooo good i left stuffed a complete meal for only 9 95 the roasted chicken was sooo good cant wait to go back and the one glass of sangria definitely gave me a buzz .
major problem with the bethwood they have 6 events going on at one time the service gets horrendous when these events clash especially if there are big events that call for lots of attention at the same time such as weddings or quincieras .
had an awesome meal here with our friends prior to seeing a broadway show next time we are in nyc well definitely try pio pio again our friends daughter who lives in manhattan has been here before and recommended it peruvian chicken was excellent .
hmm very disappointing experience we just came back from taking a two week vacation in japan and were craving some izakaya the food was pretty bad we ordered around 12 different dishes and the only thing that was good was the miso soup .
walked here for lunch during work to pick up some takeout their lunch menu is fabulous and you get a lot of food for just 10 95 it made 2 lunches for me the avocado salad is yummy .
friendly staff good menu but low quality food im not sure why the raining has been so high fish were not fresh and meat was dry fried food was cold very unfortunate .
great service like their indoor design order pio pio chicken every time i go the chicken is very good .
came here for a first date back in april 2014 got suckered into ordering guacamole when the server suggested it and got tagged 10 for it i got some unsatisfying tacos and my date got some ceviche dish not worth it .
pros great sangria civeche is very tasty almost everything has a great flavor cons staff is a bit slow and disappear for long periods of time portions can be small and its a bit expensive for what it is overall great for drinks and a small bite .
the staff was very nice however the food was horrible every single dish was ridiculously over salted definitely would not recommend .
cant go wrong with the matador plate for 23 people i would order an additional rice and beans however .
dinner was over priced i got the calamares which was in a sauce that tasted like liquid salt and smelled like a fish market i threw up this morning i think it may have something to do with dinner .
good peruvian food and great drinks in an awesome and trendy venue .
i came here for happy hour after seeing the good reviews the food was terrible we ordered chicken and pork tacos they were all soggy and very bland the margaritas were good but i do not think that i will return .
satisfied my hungry stomach beautiful ambiance .
pros excellent service comfortable dining room cons average food overpriced way better options in philly to ever justify coming back here .
my gf is from peru so she brought me here great food great ambiance with good service and veryyy nice drinks .
what kind of mexican restaurant charges for chips and salsa and doesnt serve rice and beans with the meal this might have been forgiven if the food was good but it was merely passable and the portion sizes were laughable for the price .
this place is amazing the decor is pretty exotic if youre into the cave experience ordered the matador the best bang for your buck lots of food with tons of green sauce always ask for more green sauce .
ive been in airplanes with bigger bathrooms .
great atmosphere i went with a large group for a friends birthday and we had a blast everyone loved the foodeven me and im a vegetarian so there were very few veggie options the service ambiance and price is definitely right .
this is not a mexican restaurant like you think it is a diner that serves some mexican food and some beer i was under the impression that this was a bar it is not drinks were good and staff was great nothing bad to say about this place .
went back and tried the lomo saltado now that is a 5star meal if you can convince yourself to not order chicken at a place famous for chicken you might just be pleasantly surprised .
i really like the vibe of steven starr restaurants and el rey had a great design and decor however i didnt love the mexican food i enjoy the cheapno frills tacqueria tacos more than i did this version .
what a fantastic place great ambiance amazing food nice drinks service is great too i keep going there again and again to eat the matador combo prices are reasonable too .
this resturznt is absolutely terrible it look like a midtown diner that had the front painted gold inside is very tired looking lunch was terrible tacos looked like vomit tostadas were absolute crap alambres de pollo was more like more vomit terrible .
great atmosphere great sangria excellent starters and entrees mixto ceviche and paella like dish seafood and rice dish are my favorites service is a tossup sometimes great sometimes really slow either way its worth it let me work it .
first of all how can a mexican restaurant not have bottled hot sauce they charge for nachos and salsa crushed up tomatoes food was terrible if you want really good mexican food go to mexican post on front and chestnut .
so delicious so quick and so affordable we love pio pio and their green sauce have only gotten take out but it looks like a nice place to eat too .
cool decor but the food and service were not the starr experience skip this one and go to el vez instead .
wow what a feast we ordered for three the matador sampler a whole chicken with rice beans tostones salchipapa and avocado salad plus the lomo saltado and yuca frita and a half carafe of sangria a tad too sweet yes we had lots of leftovers beautiful restaurant .
the food was decent but way overpriced the restaurant was super loud and we felt rushed the entire time .
great place even better food and lovely atmosphere the grilled chicken is the best will definitely recommend and will always come here when hosting out of towners .
went back for normal dinnerfood wasnt very good and definitely overpriced saw more people drinking the margs than eating however will still come here for happy hour1 tacos and 4 cocktails still reel me in .
the atmosphere the quality of food and the price were all excellent .
the decor after the front of the place is great straight out of a scene from pulp fiction beer selection is okay the standard cool beers list that has become vogue as of late food is good but pricey for the portions worth checking out once .
1 love love love the sangria i would go just for the sangria 2 delicious tender wellseasoned chicken 3 dramatic ambience great for dates parties dinner 1 obnoxiously loud music .
el rey is just okay the food is lacking in flavor but the atmosphere and decor make up for it overall i probably wouldnt come here again unless someone dragged me .
everything was good ceviche mixto chicken empanadas etc the place is pretty loud but bearable .
completely low rent version of distrito .
food awesome staff awesome and drinks amazing great place we had a blast for my friends birthday dinner will be back again .
i really did not feel the food was that good and the prices were high considering the small portions and diner ambiance .
good food nice place with a modern desing quick service at least an opportunity to sing a bdays song each nights the only bad thing a little bit noisy .
i wanted to order for delivery and they gave me such a hard time because they were too busy to deliver if you dont want to deliver food then dont offer a delivery service .
matador combo yum date night vibe chicken with green sauce crack eat at your own risk to your waistline really cool atmosphere .
update to previous review just tried veras pizza and wow was it good the owner is very proud of his restaurant and it shows in the pizza they also deliver i plan on frequenting them often especially now that there is another option for pizza delivery .
this is the perfect date place or event a good birthday dinner spot unique romantic decor big portions everything is delicious i tried the corvina appetizer and the matador combo i would recommend and will definitely return .
not fantastic sadly theyre among the few pizza places that deliver to my area so sometimes i have to settle for them .
i had this during my last trip to ny and i must say that this was the best chicken ive had in a restaurant the matador combo was great for 5 people .
even though this pizzeria is down the street from my house i eat there under no circustances not only is the pizza hardly average but the employees are extremely rude eating there was an overall unpleasant experience .
the rotisserie chicken here is so good it should be illegal throw in the green house sauce and you can lock me up all day pio pio .
the sign outside said something like 1 for the freshest slice in philadelphia my slice was undercooked and had probably been sitting out for at least two hours when id rather walk a few blocks and spend my 1 at wendys youre not doing pizza right .
pisco tres leches lomo salatado aji de gallina ceviche delish while during a vacation trip we came across the reviews for this hidden spot loved it awesome atmosphere great music waiter was awesome cant wait to return on my next trip to nyc .
ok yes slices are 1 dollar that doesnt make it worthy of 5 stars you can get dominoes for the same cost as rosas and it will taste better dont be fooled by the 4 star reviews for this pizza place .
good vibe restaurant and it has nice decoration too try lomo salteado piscos can be expensive be careful .
what are all these 45 star reviews this pizza isnt even passable for dollar slices the smell alone made me retch i appreciate the nice guys and their philanthropy but please make a better product first .
walking by the front door very inconspicuous but as soon as you walk thru the curtain wow gorjuss food was equally presentable quantity was waaay too much i felt bad for wasting it the cebiche was awesome and so were the pisco drinks .
i was eager to try this place out but was disappointed the pizza looks really good but tastes pretty bland and cardboardlike .
the food is consistently good the atmosphere is uniquely dungeonesque the servers are attentive my only criticism its loud and a popular birthday party spot be prepared to hear the spanish happy birthday song repeatedly if youre there on a busy night .
beautiful decor but the food was shockingly mediocre initially came for the cuttlefish risotto but was informed that there was a new chef as of fall 2014 highly disappointing .
hands the best place to get south american food in the city .
i would give this place zero stars if i could i had the duck confit pasta and had the worse food poisining of my life i went there on a friday and here it is sunday and im still sick beware .
great food good for birthdays .
no attention to new visitors we were seated but waited for the menu for 710minutes very poor service table remains dirty and waiters do nothing as for food it was nice service very bad .
i love this food i had the matador combo it was enough for 2 ppl i just think the chicken was a lil dry good atmosphere and good for big parties .
the space is gorgeous very impressed but the food is very salty from salad to appetizers .
great spot in hells kitchen for chicken we shared the combo came with chicken fries and salad tons of food for two whatever the green sauce is id drink it its so good .
over rated i just had dinner here and i cant think of one thing i liked about the place the service was bad the room was cold the food was subpar and overpriced there are several places nearby that are better than this .
the bathrooms are very clean which tells you a lot about the kitchen our server was courteous and helpful the food was delicious its mostly ceviche the best thing was the tres leche its the best in town coming from a latina you know that says a lot .
only had the cheesecake for dessert so the rest of the menu i cannot speak to but the cheesecake was terrible basically unsweetened ricotta cheese and scary looking sliced strawberries if you are looking for a good ny cheesecake look elsewhere .
i wish they had a version in los angeles it is a peruvian restaurant with a killer sangria .
not impressed and very expensive for the quality you get huge ktichen and large staff who is boarder line annoyingly nice probably wont go back if i was paying has a weird vibe to it that i dont like .
for dinner steaklomo was amazing .
industrial grade food beautifully plated and served by attentive well trained servers in a very well designed and ascetically pleasing space the roast chicken had the texture of rubber the potatoes were mushy and too salty and the mille foglie was made with ready made restaurant grade products .
this pio pio is the largest of all locations great from large groups the food is good large portion of lomo saltado .
worse place you can eat the food had almost no flavor but old oil it tasted stale the worst is that the food was not fresh at all and its overpriced never again will i order from this place .
there is a dish that consists of hot dogs mixed with fries .
the rice in the rolls was cold and soggy the fish was of questionable color and the server couldnt coherently explain whats in the rolls oh and the tv in the restaurant was showing a movie where peoples fingers were being chopped off .
i had a great experience at pio pio in hells kitchen the decor was so nice i have never seen anything like it our waitress was wonderful and the food and sangria were fabulous cant wait to go back .
bad sushi worse service killing flies while you eat rude and uncleanliness is apparent throughout this establishment definitely not the same place when it first opened also overpriced imo .
amazing amazing amazing the food is incredible the sangria delightful and the space is gorgeous can be a little loud but if that doesnt bother you then i think it will be hard to find fault with this place do not miss the fried rice .
the time to wait is too long and the sushi is not fresh even the lunch box is not good .
the chicken pio is amazing i would also recommend the rice and beans and salchipapas .
still no contact from sushi palace management on my horrible experience it makes me wonder if they even have a manager people dont waste your time here go to masa sushi and get better food and service .
awesome chicken absolutely love the food i usually need to have pio pio about once or twice a month service can be crappy if you sit on the ground floor near the entrance .
decent if not mindblowing we order lunch takeout from here its usually solid even if they often confuse our order all you can eat is pretty typical acceptable sushi borderline acceptable service byo is nice .
love this place everything on the menu is absolutely delicious i addicted to their matador combo and jalea yummy cant get enough of it this place is great for large groups and sooo affordable sangria is great too .
all you can eat sushi at a very reasonable price good service and often crowded caught the stomach virus probably due to a sashimi i ate that friends did not this ends my desire for sushi at bargain prices .
lomo saltado beef ceviche are awesome chicken is good too but a little over rated not my favorite .
decent sushi for all you can eat kind of wacky service .
a beautiful atmosphere great place for a large dinner party or dinner for 2 sangria is delicious prices are reasonable and portions are great service is pretty good ive been there several times including nye which didnt change the pricing of the meals .
yes its 20 00 all you can eat sushi but the wait between orders is sometimes 30 mins or longer the sushi rolls fall apart very easily dont bother .
enjoyed the food portions were large good selection on the menu i wasnt brave enough to try any of the many peruvian drinks on the menu but the sangria was great .
some things on the menu are good but the service of the restaurant is horrible you sit and wait for at least an hour and deal with incompetent workers if youre up for some frustration and subpar sushi go to sushi palace .
got the peruvian combo the chicken is super moist make sure to get the green sauce spicy creamy and delicious the fries with sausages is also quite good .
every time i have had food from here either location it has made me sick low quality food and not fresh i will never eat at or order from this place again .
my favorite pio pio location the decor is so modern and chic good music good food and awesome sangria matador combo rocks .
45 min left till official close time the guy hand gestured telling me hes closed while he was on the phone not ok with that .
ceviche was fantastic pisco drinks were good a little on the sweet side my dinner similar to some kind of a paella thing was great everything was cooked perfectly the price was as expected would definitely go back there again .
appalling service extremely rude and the food was soaked in oil absolutely terrible probably one of the worst asian places in the princeton area .
chicken was tender and moist sangria was great as was the interior decorations although the service was a little slow .
food is ok and delivery is prompt but if you are charging me a fee and bring the wrong soda how about replacing it instead of telling me to forget it and that you have other customers .
great ceviche and sangria nice ambiance when can i come back .
pad thai discraceful general tsos chicken yellow colored shrimp in half an inch of batter veggie dumpling enough green food coloring to die chicago river green i wouldnt be surprised if the majority of these other reviews were fake .
went there this saturday rainy afternoon for a quick lunch before our movie very juicy tasty chicken good peruvian cream cheese sauce for the fries in a word good but not heavenly waitors very friendly and attentive price is reasonable a pleasant try .
i just moved to princeton and was looking for a chinese takeout place i ordered my food and i opened up my food and in everything i ordered i found small dead fruit flies yuck totally unsanitary .
have had the chicken here many times since quality has been pretty consistent get the green sauce for the yuca fries .
cheap taste follow the price .
amazing wes anderson atmosphere brilliant list of liqueurs apertifs digestifs surprisingly cozy and clever little spot we just patronized the bar so no knowledge of food menu .
food was always very good but i think new owners took over noticed a big difference in the quality and taste of the food the fried food is extremely greasy not the same food .
sausage and fennel pappardelle simply the best this is if not the best one of the best restaurants downtown .
no good bad chinese food and people who work here at rude nasty i got a coupon which they refused to take i will never go back to this place .
best italian restaurant downtown this new italian spot that feels like it could have been used to shoot scenes in the godfather service is very friendlythe host and our server were both very personable and helpful .
big noodle fan was looking forward to amazing qq noodles and broth was disappointed mushy and soft the one up side is the meat was tender the spicy broth was yummy too thats about it .
seriously this is the best lasagne in the city its so good and reasonably priced their wine list is also amazing and so affordable dont forget to order the tiramisu love their wallpaper too .
dont know why people like this place the broth lacks flavor ingrdients are low quality and service is bad .
what a great little spot for very delicious pizza and pasta everything we ordered was perfect and the service was very friendly the prices are very reasonable for the quality food you receive .
subs are good pizza isnt great at all i used to go here all the time i stopped .
inspired by the old midtown ginos with the famed zebra wallpaper but with sweet service and lighttouch fresh approaches to classic dishes like the kale caesar with crispy prosciutto michael runs front of the house with warmth that made us feel like regulars after one visit .
the worst curry i have ever had too lame taste too much breading and too dirty environment .
very cosy and classy atmosphere we just had drinks at the bar all of our cocktails were very very good the service was awesome as well everything was top quality will come back again for food .
nothing special sorry got the grand slam dont know what all the fuss is about actually felt bad i didnt go for pizza .
absolutely wonderful i brought a party of 6 here each of us had different plates and drinks each item was exquisite seriously great italian food .
are you kidding me people this was breaded greasy crap nothing fresh about it yuck not sure how only the great reviews show up they must pay yelp .
old world meets modern is the feel you get at this new italian restaurant everything was delicious from the salad to my lasagna to dessert the portions are a decent size and prices are reasonable definitely a nice new addition to the lower east side .
its japanese greasy fast food the only good curry ive ever had is curryya in east village i guess greasy is kind of hard to avoid in this neighborhood .
best lasagna outside of italy thank u for making it the proper way with béchamel .
very overrated curry im japanese and im embarrassed to have them claim that they have awardwinning curry .
loved the vibe and the food fully enjoyed my pizza with salame and the tiramissu for dessert its my new favorite spot in this neighborhood .
so bad taste and only rice is a lot of portion .
excellent food with reasonable prices id definitely visit here again and would recommend to friends .
relatively cheap but unhealthy and not great quality tastes ok will not go again everything is fried and there are no healthy alternatives .
i came here with my nephew and my parents the night of my first marathon and it was exceptional probably the best italian food ive ever had and they had fried brussell sprouts as an appetizer unreal they were exquisite highly recommend service was good too .
not bad curry is ok the tonkatsu is a little too thin for my liking and strangely it had tonkatsu sauce on it too i make better katsu curry at home .
theres truth to the belief that the east coast knows how to make pizza i felt like julia roberts in eat pray love and it was gluten free best pizza ive ever had im ruined thank you ann and tatum for the great service .
tried to go here today but realized that all of the dishes have pork in them which i dont eat kind of a bummer cause this place sounded good .
finest ingredients fun pizzas and on pratt street i had the mystic pizza over the summer and it was one of the finest ive ever had the pizza carbonara is great in the colder months this place will get huge ifwhen the get a roof top patio .
tasted very weird to me far from the typical japanese curry we have in japan seems like they tried to accomplish something but it just went wrong sorry but i just didnt like it at all .
fried brussel sprouts were great the saint is an excellent cocktail highly recommend this place .
im quite disappointed with go go curry and think they have been overrated decent japanese curry but not the best i have tried here the curry sauce was not served hot they said you will get addicted to their curry but i dont miss it at all .
the staff was extremely friendly and knowledgable and the food was amazing i would highly recommend the risotto it was comforting like a hug this is a great addition to hartfords food scene .
how do you serve someone pizza with a huge puddle of oil on it is that not from cheaper grade mozzarella looked bad tasted worse nothing is worse then craving some pie and it sucks i will go back to just driving by .
its hard to find a good breakfast spot now i dont have to look anymore super clean and fresh location with amazing bagels and all fresh ingredients whether its breakfast or lunch deli on a bagel is an awesome choice love it and will continue to visit daily .
pizza is so so there are better choices in town .
great food service coffee the inside is nice and clean the prices maybe a little pricey but i dont mind its worth it .
absolutely terrible basil gnocchi is horrid clam pizza is horrific waiters were very rude out of a group of 8 not one single person enjoyed their meal definitely do not recommend .
i work right nearby and this place has become my goto lunch option great food great service .
you are better to walk in then to make a reservation 30 after our reservation we are still waiting im at the point i am not hungry anymore .
the bagels and panninies are excellent the staff is super friendly and helpful the best bang for your buck in mercer county .
i dont understand what the other people on here are raving about have you never had actual good nyc italian food this isnt it the service was awful and the food was on par with the olive garden a few blocks away dont waste your money .
my coworkers and i love to stop here before work best quick breakfast in the area prices are a little more than expected but worth it .
why are there so many great reviews for this place the customer service is fantastic but the food is really bad and frozen everything tastes like it was cooked in a microwave id rather eat at an olive garden .
stopped here once on my way home from a class in pa bagels are excellent really nice decor and friendly staff as well wish i lived closer id definitely be a regular visitor .
used to love this place until the fuckers took away a full uneaten plate of calamari that we paid for fuck you assholes at least pack it for us to go and not toss it away .
this place probably has the best bagels ive ever had and i lived in nyc for 12 years theyre really really great the tuna melts and salads are good too the service is always friendly and swift great place .
mediocre food and a lot of it .
i love it have only gone for breakfast but everything is good and comes out fast they will even make you a hamburger for breakfast if you what great bagels and the pancakes were surprisingly good .
i knew i wasnt going to enjoy this meal even before i even tasted it by the color of the sauce its bright red and genericlooking sweeter than a processed dessert food the eggplant parmigiana is very thin pieces of eggplant with a lots of heavy breading .
best chinese food in southern bergen county amazing fried rice check them out you be the judge .
was expecting much better this restaurant is quantity over quality and is frequented due to its popular location portions were huge but taste was meh .
there chicken w broccoli lunch special is delicious they use yellow fried rice also there chicken wings is yummy .
mediocre but affordable italian food all family style dishes pasta was all undercooked and the meats were unimpressive i thought nyc was supposed to have good italian food all 3 desserts i tried were awful tourist trap pass .
my favorite local chinese place been ordering here for years always great .
i dont get what all the hype is about i much prefer bella luna across town the marinara wasnt all that good and the service could have been better skip it .
excellent brews i really enjoyed the ear inn ale the bartender was really nice and talked to us about the history of the bar and the ghost there arent many places where you can learn and drink at the same time a nyc gem perfect bar for halloween .
as of jan 2 2011 i would not recommend this place you will be disappointed if you want good italian food carmines is the only place to go tonys was a waste of money and terrible food .
best turkey burger ever i love this place for its cozy neighborhood feel which is increasingly difficult to find in manhattan its best to come here late on a weekend night for great pints food conversation .
i was there with a big party and we tried several things on the menu steak special rigatoni bolognese pasta mushrooms chicken eggplant it was just so so with the exception of the eggplant it was killer otherwise wouldnt go back .
good cheeseburger roasted potatoes on the side was a good addition that you dont see too often quality service and a good almost rustic atmosphere with the restaurant being at the former edge of manhattan and the hudson all in all a solid burger joint .
gigantic portions of reasonably ok food nothing to complain about but nothing worth going out of your way for either .
friendly local watering hole would recommend you seek it out and soak up some history and booze .
the best cheesecake good soups and breakfast food other than that stay away from anything else especially the meatloaf my cell phone has better flavor and more moisture than their meatloaf .
decent cozy restaurant with good food and average beverage selection the atmosphere was cozy .
awful drunk people flock here bc you have to be drunk to eat their food only go if youre desperate for a bite .
this is a great old bar probably the best part of the bar is mickey the bartender definitely a great spot for locals and regulars .
our server was very sweet that is the only good thing i can say about this diner we ordered disco fries and they were a tasteless mass of blah if you cant master disco fries you have problems and shouldnt call yourself a diner .
came here on a bar tour of the city and have been coming back ever since a neat little place a little divey and totally old school definitely not for everyone but worth a try who knows you might fall in love like i did .
standard diner food nothing to brag about parking as has been mentioned can be a real pain in the ass waitresses are pretty friendly though gets an extra star .
food and service was great people are super friendly and want to chat with you only small drawback is it gets really loud since they pack the table into a small space especially after 6pm would come back for sure .
typical diner fare i definitely have had better will do in a pinch if i must .
this place is awesome best burgers that i have try in nyc so far it is quiet no tourists messing around genuine american style supernice waiters i love it one of my favorite spots in the city .
meh so i came here once with my sister my food was simply disappointing hers gave her food poisoning seriously must be some crazy health code violations here they dont even try plenty of better places around .
i love drinking beers outside at ear inn its like drinking on the street but legal i wonder how much longer it will last with the area changing so much every year food is pretty decent too see ya in the spring for more outdoor boozing i hope .
turn around there are 2 better diners topped diner and lyndhurst diner only 5 min drives away on the same road if you like food that sucks eat here .
old time new york city seafaring bar and grill located in a historical building and they pour a nice guinness dont mind the ghosts .
typical diner fare nothing notable though and with its proximity to tops down the same road people usually end up eating at tops unless its too packed then theyll probably come here .
really like this spot if you can go in when mickey is working one of the more interesting and personable bartenders in the city .
hot waitress not so hot food .
the lamb burger was delicious .
this place was horrible service was slow had to ask multiple times for drinks took forever to get our food medium rare steak came out more than well done other items missing from order avoid this place .
this place has excellent food everything i have had mainly burgers soup salad blts is first rate and its also a historic bar quite worth a visit even if all you want is a beer .
this order was almost totally incorrect when that happens the thing to do is to go the extra mile to make it right such as bringing the correct order to the customer at the gate also pretty foul from the food to the coffee .
so glad i was guided here by a friend of mine whos a regular cozy friendly bar atmosphere in a historic building that was at one time right up against the hudson good beer selection friendly barkeep and they had the game on cant ask for much more .
stephane was great the burger and margareta not so good substandard i could have got a better buffer at mcdonalds for 14 of the cost they used table salt for the rim of the margareta dont come here for a cheese burger .
came here for a lunch meeting we both had the lamb burger and werent disappointed its definitely a good place for lunch and im told that you can always get a table .
ill keep this review short and simple service was friendly but the food was not good gave me a sour stomach before a flight never a good thing .
wondering how the ear inn fared during hurrican sandy are you okay .
the only thing good about this place was our waiter food was mediocre the reason for the 2 stars is the little rude register chic seriously good service starts at the top and this place must have bad management lacking quality and warmth .
best chili ever .
horrible i ordered a vegetable omelette and it was tasteless yet pricey how can you screwup an omelette the fresh squeezed orange juice was dilute and probably processed will never come back .
very cool ancient bar really good basic food only been for lunch turkey or angus burgers are great only tihng keeping it from 5 stars is theyre pretty pissy about splitting checks .
if the food was as good as the service was we would not come back juan thanks for the great service .
one of my favorite sunday night spot jazz liveband and friendly staff in a weird neighborhood just try it .
eggs benedict includes shoe leather english muffin incinerated ham with watereddown hollandaise sauce skip this joint .
good bar better food great mussels i love to go here to drink or for dinner .
food is crap and service is slow turkey sandwich with chips turkey was cold and had a freezer burn taste chips were deep fried and excessively oily luckily they took it back and apologized decided to go elsewhere for a bite in the airport .
another great dive great service and a good meal .
i ordered the philly cheese steak on foccacia the foccacia was a regular roll just square there were more onions than steak the mushrooms were canned the fries were from cisco they were out of half the beers from an already limited menu .
a classic establishment in a slightly off the beaten path location which is always good in ny food is excellent beers are cold service is entertaining a must stop for dinner or drinks before shows at city winery .
went back to give it another shot still not impressed good sangria but thats about it wont be back .
solid music on sunday nights as well as good dark beer and great company .
just got back from spain this place was a so so they never gave us water my wife and i watched the waitress give every table water except ours kinda weird super overpriced .
giddyup great burger fries bartender atmosphere and whisky it all just tastes better here im coming to see live music here sometime hell i want to play live music here i like to be comfortable in a bar this is it .
i really expected better it looks like a very cool spot in the village however it is extremely small crowded and hot the food sounded better than it was i wont be back .
this place is just cool old fashioned simple plus you can color on the tables .
i was excited to try this place but it was a total let down the service was piss poor and the food was mediocre at best ive been the madrid and barcelona so ive had excellent tapas this was a one and done not going back .
wholesome with food ale and ok music .
the good the mussels and croquettes were delicious the bad its very loud in there the waitress was anything but friendly and their sangria is very week .
one of my favorite bars arguably the best guinness on tap in the city an oldfashioned vibe and great staff you can sense the history at the ear .
cute place but mediocre tapas .
not at all what you think its going to be from the outside fun historical bar with a lot of character great prices great selection we didnt eat but the food next to us smelled good it would totally be my local bar if i lived there .
i want to give las ramblas 2 5 stars it was ok but there are much better tapas places in the city everything was super deep fried with very little taste the sangria was watered down although had good flavor waitstaff was friendly and helpful though .
like my favorite place ever great food never a long wait cool if not a bit disenchanted older crowd of new yorkers their dumplings and shrimp scampi are great .
good sangria really poor customer service and my partner got food posion at this place .
gotta love the ambiance the bartender the night i was there was a character hahaha the crayons on the table made the night become an art show hahaha awesome spot to chill and laugh with your friends .
we recently ordered the bbq chicken and spare ribs combo the meats were very bland very disappointing .
they are super nice to bikers especially on tues when we congregate on the sidewalk for sunset great burgers chill staff .
the bbq was ok rice was decent fries were fresh got dessert to bring home when i got home i opened the dessert container and the dessert was moldy on top and bottom disgusting .
nonpretencious chill publike spot with down to earth people in this hood thats a great thing authentic like mammas cookin shepherds pie period .
nauseas as we speak meat is smoky as all hell which kills the taste of everything else i got two soft tacos with bbq pork shoulder street corn red onion guac cheese and crema sounds good looked great tasted blah .
great atmosphere and bar food live music twice a week and they even have their own ear ale brewed by brooklyn brewery the ear never gets old .
good food basically a bit better than chipotle next door the only difference hence the 2stars is the ear bleeding hip hop music just consistently and aggressively loud .
excellent mussels appetizer and the burger was baller cant beat the history and decor mixed laidback clientele crowd the place for a reason .
i just picked up some beef and chicken tacos and a brisket burrito from this place and they were not good at all the beef briskets were not cooked and the chicken tasted as if it were cooked a few days ago .
what an amazing place solid atmosphere fantastic bartenders and in a neighborhood i hadnt ever stepped foot in there are a string of bars on this block so you can bar hop if for some godunknown reason you dont happen to fall in love with the ear inn .
felt better going out than it did going in the beer was decently cold as was the rest of my food though gotta bring your own rolaids or microwave .
my favorite lazy summer hang out you can sit in the sun while sipping on your beer .
chicken dry out of nearly everything but dont tell you until near end sign outside says free guaq but yep you guessed it find out theyre out at end .
this awesome institution is a hidden gem the bartenders are charming the ambiance is cosy and the menu is full of my favorite comfort food its a great place for a chill date or a meal with friends i especially love he old phone booth score .
the service today was awful they handed me a flirt tray the server one particular guy with buck teeth and a hairy face was rude .
alot of spillage of people on the street alot of history in this place alot of drunk tardedness that can happen and it can all start at the ear inn glad its by my work place .
first off there were flies everywhere found one in my guac i got the chicken bowl the chicken was chewy i ordered chips and salsa there were out of pico the other salsa has no flavor chipotle is a few feet down go there wasted 13 .
i like ear inn it is a hike from where i live but i love the outdoor area and the easy going nature of the place i have only been for after dinner cocktails but would love to come back for dinner prices are pretty good too .
guacamole was good and so was the brisket but comparing it to chipotle it unfortunately falls short the rice was a bit bland and so were the beans save your time and just go to chipotle .
yup a really good old bar be ready to hoist a few .
hmmmm saw an article about this place and thought it was all just a meh experience in terms of taste design was awesome though .
my friend took me to this place we had a few beers and shimp scampi i believe thats what it is called it was really good spicy and garlic shrimp with toasted bread went well with the beers thanks buddy .
meat was burned that creates cancer i was told please avoid food cucumber drink was ok your decision .
i swear to gawd there was a vampire sitting two tables over he interacted with nobody sat alone and had fangs turns out that he was part of the little jazz trio that started right about midnight .
horrible slow service indifferent bordering on rude average food thats what i had been told and it was accurate probably wont survive unless they replace the entire staff with people who care .
cute little bar good drinks the michalada was new to me and really tasty im from socal and have never heard of it wierd also the womens restroom felt like the smallest bathroom in the world .
if you are just tired of qdoba and want to try something else then come but do not expect it to be much different just a spinoff of a classic big burrito restaurant chain .
makes me want to drink and eat burgers again but i will go there for cokes and a fishwich ouch that hurt to write .
the chicken and the pork was cold the mixed greens is romaine lettuce the service was nice but the food was mediocre ill try again when they settle in but right now chipotle is a much better value the drinks seemed like they might be good .
cute and quaint little place i only had a glass of wine but i will be sure to visit again when im in the neighborhood a great date spot bike rack right in front .
nothing special about these sandwiches reminded me of quiznos no signature items to go out of your way for ill pass .
this place is relaxing yes its loud and crowded but its also without pretention and everyone there is so damn friendly so you can really get comfortable order the clam chowder it goes so well with a cold beer creamy heaven .
the server got my order wrong twice and it was freezing in the entire restaurant i hope you get new management .
a very charming find we had a drink and drew on the paper tablecloths with the provided crayons i hear the food is good too definitely must come back at an earlier hour for dinner then sit around and drink .
out of business closed kaput dead .
loved sitting outside feels like youre having a beer at a great barbecue except youre on a sidewalk .
ordered a steak burrito it came with freshly chopped jalapeños on it yum right wrong too spicy to eat and i like spicy food its terrible i keep taking a bite only to regret it for five minutes chill out on the jalapeños .
a very pleasant spot i had a very good burger for 8 johnnie cash at midnight followed by some great live jazz a nice surprise on a tuesday night an older crowd including a dozen or two on motorcycles a cute waitress with an enchanting irish accent .
i order wings and they were covered in red pepper flakes covered it was disgusting waited 45 minutes for them to deliver food that i had to just throw away .
i used to live down the street and probably went here to eat and have drinks 3 out of the 7 days in a week the food is good and very reliable the waitstaff is friendly but the bartenders are not .
cant believe this place has such a high rating nasty steakshad to throw them out tasted like the grill was never cleaned complete fail tacos were ok onion rings are good nachos were tossed too first last time .
perfect for a lazy day of drinking i have started many a drunken night here very cool local feel too .
i ordered a chicken burrito i got a steak burrito i ate the steak burrito thinking really whats the difference its not that bad i literally could not chew through any of the pieces of meat they put in that burrito how does that even happen .
whats not to love always feels like youve step into some undiscovered montclair gem simple menu but everything delicious from breakfast to dinner to juices love natalie and her staff theyve definitely got a good thing going yum .
horrible service the only good server is the little ecuadorian girl the others including in the front they are not nice and they dont care about the customers they never put our order and they didnt even apologized for their mistakes .
i have never been disappointed coming to plum friendly staff great food never had a dish i did not enjoy the inside has the old style diner feel while if the weather is right they offer some nice outdoor seating right on park street try the iced coffee .
rude server couldnt even bear to place an order with her will not come back here and will make sure my friends know not to patronize that place too .
great food ive been there many times the bacon sandwich kicks ass and the chorizo scramble is awesome .
the food was too salty i had been sick for 2 days the service is ok apparently there are lot of reviews about the salty food but it does not change anything .
cute place with a decent amount of vege friendly options the plum jam that comes with the toast is amazing .
what happened to this place this used to be a brooklyn staple now the food and the service is not what it used to be overly salted nothing special about the menu rip diner i will miss you .
delicious food chill atmosphere but not very toddler friendly as in they wont be very friendly to your toddlers so dont expect it .
2 5 stars the place is interesting but the service impersonal and painfully slow grassfed burger nothing special and overpriced fries were boring steak waaaaay too much for average quality no reason whatsoever to go back .
ive always had good experiences at plum quick friendly service with good quality food they make delicious smoothies and juices so far the stress buster has been my favorite the bacon is so good as well crispy without being greasy we will be back again soon .
recently went for brunch the duck hash special was tiny and had very little duck in it the pancakes were not a large portion either both dishes were ok but not great or flavorful and very overpriced doubt we will be coming back for a while .
this food is very fresh and delicious i loved the eggs benedict the potatoes and the green juice my husband enjoyed his pancakes and hot chocolate will definitely be back here .
wow was this a pretentious and overrated eatery from the menu hand written on the table paper to the ordinary 13 omelette of their choosing to the undercooked hash browns it is hard to understand what the fuss is all about .
the chorizo scramble was good glad to see yummy gluten free toast on the menu the ham egg cheese was better than you can get at a typical diner the strawberry banana peach smoothie was delish .
sorry but really disappointed in the meal i had here found the staff and menu pretentious and extremely overated for the price the beef was fatty and chewy the cabbage very uninspiring and watery the soup starter but downright horrible verging on being disgusting would not recommend .
small but with excellent ambiance nice sandwiches omelets and salads the menu is a little limited but the ingredients are fresh with a nice combination of flavors the service is excellent .
used to be great start w below par piece of meat burn it the bring it to the table and call it steak it was so good i just kept going back thinking it would be good again i wont get burned again .
lovely place delicious food and excellent service been frequenting this place for over a year and this hidden gem is a wonderful spot for a cozy brunch highly recommend .
sadly both my dining companion and i were up all night sickened after eating here she got the burger i got the flatiron steak .
we went once for brunch and both the food and the service were terrific we must have gotten there just in time as the place filled up around 1 or so we will definitely be back .
its okay nothings terrible but nothings great and its overpriced if youre really set on an upscalish eating experience inside a converted diner in williamsburg cause like who isnt right go to relish .
small but yet fit for the neighborhood try the pork tenderloin pressed sandwich and add the jam they give you at the table very good brunch menu item .
hands down the loudest generator i have ever heard with that said the price point for lunch is a little high the burrito is a better value mostly dont go because you cant hear after .
wonderful sweet potato soup and the special pork sandwich was great and i dont even like pork the wait staff was charming too i will be back .
never its a bad taco spot .
think about your goto diner take your usual order and make it healthy take your usual waitress and make her friendly boom you have plum aka the best breakfast in montclair .
seemingly nice pub run by carteret trash off the wall prices on fooddrinks you can spend the same amount of money go to hoboken or nyc and enjoy a decent night out in an upscale environment .
absolutely delicious the food here is fresh and healthy and i literally could eat the plum jam right out of the jar if i didnt have delicious toast to put it on had a wonderful breakfast and lunch here i hope they do very very well .
so disappointed we never got served so i cant even comment on the food my boyfriend and i were seated after a 15 minute wait which was fine but then we proceeded to wait for 20 minutes never being served we left not interested in going back .
stopped in for lunch based on reviews here very flavorful dishes at a very reasonable price friendly counter service gave me samples before i placed my order select your meal from the dishes they have prepared for the day generous portions easy onoff 287 .
just god awful service and the food comes out cold i asked for something to be fixed and they gave me attitude we took my boyfriends mother there and shes from out of town just embarrasing .
delicious homemade food restaurant hours seem to vary on a daily basis and is closed for sunday but authentic amazing food priced incredibly well owner is a sweetheart too .
nice space fairly quiet in the off hours snarky service turned me off to the experience .
fareek the owner is very nice their meat is fresh and delicious i wasnt crazy about the amount of the meat in my gyro but then again maybe it was just so good that i wanted more i will go back .
at best its a confused diner the food is mediocre the service is ok i expected something more .
excellent inexpensive fare served cheerfully the food could have been seasoned much more heavily for my taste but was good as it was id eat there regularly if it were nearby beat the heck out of mcds for a quick lunch stop just off the interstate .
last couple of times ive been there the sushi has been terrible mediocre at best .
have eaten here twice and food is excellent owner is nicest guy and serves up generous portions price cant be beat always has new items on the menu ill be going back regularly .
generic food with high prices not worth the money .
rarely do i write reviews but this place is phenomenal super friendly staff delicious food authentic and cheap .
the pastries are so delicious but the coffee takes forever who has 10 minutes to wait for a tiny pricey coffee in the morning if they had coffee ready to go i would be there every morning .
im not gonna waste valuable time talking like steve m i will get to the point pernil get it now .
bought groupon to try premade cold brown rice sushi was not what i expected tasted like ones you can buy at any supermarket will not be returning service was good .
wow truly a great find this food is the real deal authentic as it gets im totally blown away and cant wait to go back the food is presented buffet style and the owner said the menu is different every day im anxious to try more .
expensive and not worth the went there last weekendthe sushi wasnt fresh and we didnt enjoy it at all if i could give it 0 stars i would .
cant agree more place is a diamond in the ruff food is great lived in town forever and never gave it a second look thx to yelp i go once every few weeks .
menu is too many words too waste my time to read the menu thats make my appetite gone the food was terrible service so slow never come back again .
absolutely love this place everything is great especially for the price whether its beef chicken fish whatever the fact its family run and and everyone is friendly makes it so much the better highly recommended .
very innovative rolls great for vegetarians extremely pricey ate 5 pieces of sushi and spent 30 after leaving i felt robbed and hungry prob wont go back unless its for a social event .
amazing food a little divey but so great the food is to die for you must try the empenadas and fried plantains there are huge iced teas there for only 99 cents where else can you find that .
rice was disgusting texture is way off super gummy and overpowered the entire roll gotta get the rice right miyas .
that damn shrimp po boy is a problem otto chef youre the best ate that sandwich once a week during the summer alone or with friends who needs anyone when you have food this good for company .
the dishes on the menu are really very clever and interesting however they only serve sushi using brown rice it just was not for me .
i loved this place the calamari shrimp and corn was great this is a perfect place to go with a group of friends and enjoy a meal .
over over over over priced doesnt taste good at allllll wont come here ever again .
cheesy decor paper plates lots of hot sauce loud overcrowded love it i had the strange combination of crab cakes with a side of the creamiest artery hardening grits absolutely delicious leave room for the bread pudding it is to die for .
horrible place horrible service the owner is a douche food took extremely long to get to us and it was disgusting dont ever go here .
love brooklyn crab bring some good friends have a few drinks and enjoy the food satisfaction always guaranteed .
not a sushi place serves weird food shouldnt be called sushi they put a bunch of garbage toegether and call it a sushi roll save your time and go somewhere else not worth the hype or the wait .
we will go back again and i guess that is the best review i can give the waiter was very nice and friendly food was finger licking good the place was clean and the views are cool ill .
i couldnt agree more with nicholas who said what the hell the food is terrible this just isnt sushi how true this isnt sushi and whatever it is is absolutely gross .
really enjoyed the food and the service it was a nice friday night weather was awesome for outside eating and the ambiance was accommodating my mom and i had a fabulous time the crab dishes were well seasoned and decently priced .
miyas is terrible terrible food .
hands down my favorite place to eat crab grab a pticher of beer and sit outside cant get any better than that .
i love sushi but this place is gross i got the very hungry caterpillar dinner and it tasted liked refrigerated crap not fresh at all would not return .
loved the scenery and the views it was a rainy night and still looked beautiful the fish was amaze the waitress didnt really know much and brought us the wrong crabs but still was good recommended .
the menu has changed and all of the once flavorful rolls are now dull and tasteless .
love this place love the location love the atmosphere and the decor love the food just love it try the rum bowl for 2 .
they served uncooked sweet potato that was inedible .
a little pricey but otherwise great seafood friendly staff and an incredible outdoor area by the water with a good view of the statue of liberty .
im a huge sushi fan but this was not very good i understand the vision here but the chefs try too hard i was left confused and dissapointed i would recommend they simplify like all good sushi .
very tasty not from brooklyn but would come back price wasnt cheap but definitely worth it if you like sea food could see the statue of liberty from my rood top seat over all pretty cool place .
this is a lively fun place waiters are very informative i liked the hot saki the sushi served is overly complicated the fish lacks texture and is very bland tasting if you love great classic sushi skip this restaurant .
love this place food is great service is top notch i try coming here once a week .
really bad experience the sushi chef is mexican come on the wait was long the sushi cant be called sushi at all they are definitely not fresh the only thing recommended is the salad .
delicious seafood i always get the cajun snow crab peel and eat shrimp is great fish and chips are good too i just hate the long wait on weekends .
terrible slow service and then what arrived was well can you really call this sushi we asked for our bill and walked out .
mondays and tuesdays are 1 oysters the service was excellent the food was good and the view couldnt be beat the sceneryvibe of the place made me feel like i was in maine a much needed break from the city .
miyas takes a centuriesold tradition and turns it on its head ok great its creative but its not particularly good and its definitely not sushi sigh .
i have the opportunity to visit the restaurant it was really an amazing experience a friendly an profesional staff food was finger licking highly recommended to yall .
terribly overpriced and slow service our party waited forever to get our orders i dont care how exotic they tried to make the fusion sushi but its definitely not worth paying .
good drop by with co workers spot good prices but not the best clams on earth but very good none the less .
i came here after a particularly bad day on my own i came alone the waiter forgot me and i had to ask twice for water its pretty cheap decent quality sushi but the environment and service are substandard .
came for happy hour in the afternoon server was very attentive and the place was pretty empty on monday and tuesday there are 1 oysters and 3 beer the head on peel and eat shrimp were so damn good definitely worth going back just for those .
went tonight after reading review in the record hours listed on yelp open on mondays after driving 40 minutes with traffic it was closed this not fair only put a star because i have too .
crazy long wait on the weekends and overpriced but otherwise its a pleasant experience with pretty good food .
ok .
obsessed the best views best food a vacation just minutes away snow crabs are so good affordable and huge portion i just love it there .
free burrito bar isnt much of a burrito bar at all and they only offer the most boring tacos as half price .
lots if fun like a florida crab shack reminds me of home the oysters are fresh and the crab is awesome too great beers and who can beat the view and ambiance .
drinks are ok food has consistently been crap since i live in the neighborhood i really want this place to be awesome but its not go to mezcal down the street for good mexican food go here if youre breaking up with your significant other .
this place is awesome it was like a little piece of maine in new york i felt like i was on vacation our food was delicious the service was great the only negative was the 35 minute wait to get in i will definitely be going back .
new management took over and my two favorite things have been removed from the menu the orange honey margarita and the fajita burrito very disappointed even with the chips nothing seems the same .
there was a bit of a wait but there was lots to do in the meantime the crabs and service were great y but i dont think they give you enough for the price .
this is a ggod place to get drunk and mingle but the food was average at best another bar based on tequila with a menu thrown in after it .
i came here with my husband and son after walking around the neighborhood the wait for a table upstairs wasnt too long the food seemed so fresh beautiful views of the statue of liberty a very fun and delicious dinner overall .
bar is the strong point food is lackluster stay away from the fish they cook it like their steaks area really lacks good places .
i had a great time i love the scene and vibe super chill place to be honest the food wasnt super memorable but def go back for the scene and atmosphere great place to hang out in the summer time .
limited overpriced menu had pot roast nachos ah kids it was 4 nachos with big hunks of tough beef on top i realize they just opened but they need some serious fine tuning place is nicely redone and service was good .
best place for seafood in bk im from tha hook so you know i have to give good reviews .
the roast chicken banana rice and black beans was bland and uninteresting i dont know what other people tasted when they had this dish but it really wasnt worth finding this place .
mom is enjoying her birthday week a dinner a night very happy shes enjoying this .
huge disappointment this place is way overpriced for cafeteria style service the shrimp in the shrimp ceviche was clearly prefrozen lacking any semblance of taste the fried plantains were awful and the yellow rice was mediocre at best the stars are for the service and the black beans .
thank you to all who wrote negative reviews we got seated within five minutes food was great crab rolls french fries and amazing broccoli with garlic servers were friendly helpful and quick everyone stay away from brooklyn crab because we intend to go back and enjoy ourselves again .
this review is just for the cubano which was tasty but couldve used pickle in each bite other than that fairly wellbalanced but at 7 not the cheapest or one of the best cuban sandwiches ive had .
redhook has really out done themselves with this spot its a fff a family fun favorite great beer crabs view and mini golf .
i had high expectations after reading yelp reviews ive had much tastier and cheaper meals further north in manhattan i will not be back .
nice restaurant bar has a beach theme i like it because it has a different feel than any other place in ny especially given how open red hook is .
will try the chicken next mondongo monday or pasteles no more soggy cubanos with more pickles than pork coffee was good .
really liked the snow crabs fried oysters my husband had the crab bites one of the fried fish baskets he enjoyed his meal as well will definitely go again .
seating was easy to find especially since most people that come in order and take it back to the office to eat the cubano was okay its a nice change from having to eat a subway sandwich fast service fun staff quick starttofinish ordering process .
great place to spend an afternoon on a hot day good bar tasty chilled seafood good view of the water the area is crying out for more places like this especially so given the fairly long wait times to be seated .
stopped in here for coffee and espresso and was disappointed weak espresso and weaker french press coffee accompanied by a dirty cup and an owner with an attitude ill skip this one for a revisit .
what a wonderful addition to the neighborhood im very surprised by some of the negative reviewsthey certainly dont represent our recent experience here the fried shrimp basket and fish sandwich were particularly good and reasonably priced the service was also good were looking forward to returning highly recommended .
every time i go to the one in west orange they always forget something in the order i will never go again .
the fried scallops are the most delicious and you will get the most generous serving of seafood anywhere you will enjoy the calm and tranquil river view and selection of their beers on tap .
the absolute worst food ive ever had in my life ive had diarrhea for the past 24hrs the rice was extremely salty the veggies were wilted and the meat was gross .
love it .
im sorry but this food was lousy chicken chow fun tasted like fish standard dishes like chicken string bean and moo shu pork were not worth eating dinner literally went into the garbage very disappointing .
where else can you find this atmosphere one of the best views in the 5 boroughs who cares what they serve the place is a blast and the staff was really friendly .
this place again is soooo dirty owners please take the time to clean your establishments im begging you the food also tastes horrible i know i know we ordered the food and had it delivered before we visited the restaurant we wont be back .
fantastic we went there 5 friends with very different preferences and we all loved it see you soon .
poor mans farmhouse great if your hungry and your early for a movie other than that ill pass food was ok .
super fast service with great dish options love the vermicelli with the roll on top filling and delicious and good service .
should have stayed with the burger had the fish sandwich was bland tastes like nothing more than cod on a bun the french fries arrived cold our first visit not sure id come back .
wonderfully tasty food services is excellent and so helpful navigating the menu when your a first timer eating vietnamese .
this was the most disappointing meal i have ever had i asked for medium rare and i got so well done my burger could have been used in a hockey game and i paid 13 for it but i assure you that will not happen again .
best cha gio pork and shrimp fried spring rolls ever also the che dau a must have at the end of your meal love x3 this place .
cons over roasted coffee muffins and bagels poor quality pros attracts people who enjoy talking to strangers great people watching in the heart of the italian market good whoopie pies .
delicious food nice decor makes for a great meal i am never disappointed with this place to which i often dine in or do take out their nuoc mam sauce is the best even out of towners are impressed with this place if only they would deliver .
4 stars for the yummy macarons 1 star for server who touched her hair with the gloved hand which they use to pick up the macarons not appetizing to say the least although i saw her do this after she served me wont return to this location .
one of my favorite places to eat the house special noodle bowl knows no competition when im there and i always come back to it if you want a little more space or easier parking you can always visit their west philadelphia location .
the employees are snobby but the macarons were decent .
one of my favorite vietnamese restaurants in philly the spring rolls are one of the best i had compared to other vietnamese restaurants i been to the service is friendly and the setting is nice the prices are affordable they take reservations for large parties .
came all the way from cali on labor day and they are close at 6pm dont even tell us they close early .
upscale vietnamese place without the upscale prices .
not a fan too sweet .
not the best pho ive ever had but still very good .
bouchon bakery is much better night day difference bigger softer and tastier skip this bougie place and go there prime example of yelp gone wrong .
best vietnamese spring rolls in philly food is consistently good love the barbecue platter with a little of everthing dont like that they make you wait for your whole party to seat you nice decor and wait staff .
the macaroons here have a weird perfume flavor it taste like chemicals if you want to have a real macaroon go to bisous ciao les .
great spring rolls and big portions i would definitely come back again .
probably i dont have the taste nerve as most people do i just dont like their macarons it is way toooo sweet .
great pho also had a live crab cooked in the most interesting and delicious way service was great .
my friends love this place i think its ok maybe try keeping the macaron for a day after purchase my homemade ones tasted a lot better after it was rested .
spring rolls are awesome seafood pot great beef plate amazing totally great .
i went there with my girl friend and we ordered 2 different risottos they were both disgusting and we couldnt even finish the half of the plate even though we were really hungry the food is terrible and the prices are unneccessary expensive .
the big bowl of soup here has healing powers but in all seriousness this restaurant and other places like this is why i love philly and its eclectic collection of people food and culture thank you vietnam restaurant .
horrible place the head waiter was uptight and look discheveled the calamari was horrible and we waited 30 minutes for our food i recommend not going .
i love vietnam can go there over and over again always in the mood for it .
i walked my dogs by here one morning as dpw was taking away risotto houses garbage and there tons and tons of magats crawling around under the garbage maybe not their fault but if the shoe fits etc etc etc ew .
yummy food fast and friendly service and were very accommodating of our large group i visited with a group of people while we were attending a convention nearby and we left happy and full .
food was ehhh bruchetta was over cooked burnt the cheese risotto tasted a bit off the pork chop special was good sauce was a bit heavy .
the food is really good .
food came for lunch the chicken i ordered looked strange and the soup tasted like it was microwaved service the waiter was not friendly nor apologetic for getting my order wrong brought me the wrong dish ambianceoverall also the ambiance was darkold during the day wouldnt come back .
my favorite spot to visit in chinatown before 3am they have some killer noodle dishes the atmosphere is always buzzing i guess im not the only one that likes the place .
the grilled steak plate was so overly saltyseasoned that i still taste it 3 days later .
best vietnamese food in philadelphia service is always good and the food is consistently excellent .
strongly not recommend ordered grilled chicked plate takeout from seamless com the food might not be clean got abdominal cramps and felt dizzy for 3 hours now .
the right place in philly for our vietnamese food craving excellent tender greens and goi cuonpork chop was tender and deliciousnot as happy with the beef stuffed grape leaves avoid green papaya salad tasty cosmopolitan .
warning their name is mooncake but they have no mooncakes also the food was sub par sorry im not im not sorry .
great vietnamese food with excellent service equal to if not better than similar options in new york city the traditional dishes are made well and quite flavorful .
whatever you do do not come here they literally drown every dish in lime juice ive never entered a restaurant where the food on my plate was untouched this changed after i went to mooncake foods .
a great traditional family owned and orientated for two generations restaurant friendly owners and servers fair price some dishes are amazing especially the bbq sampler they are featured on travel channels different magazines almost everyone loves this place .
this is essentially fast food ok in a pinch but certainly not great by any standard dumplings lack refinement lobster summer rolls were stale fish in the fish tacos is dry steak with rice is ok .
this is my favorite vietnamese restaurant in philadelphia although i havent tried much dishes other than the saigon noodles which i am obsessed with definitely beats the other vietnamese places on the same street .
just another viet restaurant small fun runs out of food to serve green jalepeno garlic sauce is good calamari is soso if grilled you could not tell difference from steamed veges wilted and poor today shanghai ribs are just like any korean bbq just ok food .
the food here is extremely flavorful i am always thinking about the amazing lemongrass pork chops they have here which i highly recommend overall the inside is very nice and the prices are moderate but i typically prefer vietnam palace across the street for their amazing soup .
horrible food i actually spit it out we asked for our check of course we gave our waitress her tip but i was so so so disappointed i normally get their delivery from their sister restaurant and its normally so yummy but wow this place was horrible .
my favorite place delicious food and great service i just cant get enough of it .
flavors were fine waitress was rushed but friendly pulled pork sandwich was flavorful and a good deal for the price dumplings were overcooked and short ribs were burnt and fatty wont be back .
i had a spring roll noodle bowl it was very tasty i enjoyed it i have a dear friend that is vietnames so i am a bit spoiled i will be coming back here .
ordered a tomato soup and salad both were disgusting not to mention the cookie they send is stale and inedible threw everything away .
read my review of their sister restaurant with the same name todays meal here was crispy duck and it was ok but the service was fine i liked the other place better .
i only come here for the coffee not a big fan of the food i had high expectations because my friend recommended it and told me i have to go their toast is good though lol 0 o .
takeout was ready in 5 minutes i like this very much beef lemongras soup amazingness perfect way to wrap up jan 1 2012 aka national hangover day .
tasteless tomato sauce limp crust and slices of mozzarella poor excuse for pizza cant understand why this has so many good ratings they dont seem to put any effort into constructing a good product .
fantastic broken rice pork chops chicken chow fun chicken papaya salad veggie pho and chicken lemongrass soup all so good great flavor good service and quality restaurant i ate here 2 nites in a row cuz it was so delicious on my business trip highly recommend this place .
eeeh i expected more i ordered a small classic with roasted artichokes and while the pizza was ok there were cold spots in the pizza how does that happen on fresh made pizza i prefer grimaldis in hoboken .
a local hotel front desk clerk pointed me here for a late night bite win i had the bbq pork vermicelli with a crispy spring roll while not a generous bowl it was great actually barbequey .
was mancinnis sold .
im vietnamese and whenever i have a craving this is the place i goto my personal favorite is anything in the claypot fish in a claypot in particular comes with rice and the catfish is cooked in this hot pot salt and pepper chicken is good too .
our pizza was dry and crackly the tables are crammed together the menu is small the prices high there are better pizzas in the surrounding blocks avoid .
stuffed grape leaves and house special vermicelli bowl thats all you need to know .
chicken parmesan was below average 23 tilapia was just ok lunch sandwiches are just bad any deli would make better sandwiches im not going back there for lunch or dinner .
pros fresh great tasting food service is excellent affordable nice ambiance cons parking esp for dinners .
this place is horrible the fact that the owner from italy would put this kind of low quality tasteless food on a table is a disgrace stick to pizza at romeos .
friendly staff clean establishment and yummy food soups were excellent .
had the pork chops big portions but they came out a little dry great ambience not sure whether id come back should have had a pasta dish instead .
good place to eat .
mediocre service mediocre food .
really good really fresh lots of fresh veggies and herbs i have been to many vietnamese places in many cities this place is real authentic fresh vietnamese cuisine the bbq platter is perfect for two people there are lots of smokey flavors which i love .
went for a romantic dinner with husband did not like the place it says mediterranean but the menu only had italian food service could do better .
best spring rolls every time i am in philly i have to make a stop here for the bun vermicelli with chicken and spring rolls consistently excellent food and nice atmosphere .
dont order thai iced tea or bubble tea tasted powdered and artificial and too sweet will need to ask for your check and service is slow to take your order .
my boyfriend and i randomly decided to try out vietnam restaurant and we loved it the food was filling and the service was great i will definitely come back .
food is meh we had the shrimp and chips and the scallops dinner the seafood was fresh but not seasoned at all and the fries sucked i wont be going back .
genuinely good food spring rollsnot fried were excellent and the dipping sauce too i had shrimp curry i would recommend a few more shrimp but veggies were fresh and tasty with this entree you will not be disappointed .
lame cheeseburger looked like a kids burger and tasted like it too looks like a hole in the wall place inside .
not to be confused with vietnam palace across the street they are continually on the mark with simple cheap and amazingly tasty food .
avoid at all costs no good reason to go a place that looks like this better have good food it does not .
best spring rolls ever nobody in the city can beat their spring rolls and trust me i have tasted alot of spring rolls around the city of philadelphia and new york and the vietnam resturant comes out on top .
montclair diner is charging 2 25 for a glass of seltzer when questioned the hostess said oh that is considered a soda we have to pay for the gas in the thingy etc folks that is ridiculous been going to this dive for too long i guess .
best noodle bowls and spring rolls in the land portions are gargantuan .
great food and excellent service but very disappointing and inconvenient that they only take cash and no credit cards to management please pay the darn fees and make life easier for your patrons .
this place is amazing its hard not to stop in when im in the area my favorite food is the vietnamese meatballs the service is really fast too the place isnt that big so if you can an early arrival might ensure your seated right away .
4 for ambience 2 for food 3 for service the food is not memorable its decorated nicely but nothing wows me unfortunately ive had better .
delicious authentic vietnamese food restaurant is very clean and more than i expected for the typical asian restaurant will definitely come back here when im in philly again .
dont go hungry because you still will be when you leave and bring a wad of cash cause its expensive and well they only take cash was really disappointed .
you must order the spring rolls they are unparalleled it has gotten a little pricier over the years but it has an upscale modern atmosphere also the corn rice pudding is worth a try .
average at best space is incredibly bad servers are disconnected food is good but the total experience is average at best .
really good often crowded 3 levels of great food that really out among the other chinatown clutter good prices on food and drinks hit or miss service is the only reason theyre not sitting on a 5 star spot .
easier to just drive ten minutes to get my delivery food 1 12 hrs later and still waiting .
always delicious yum .
my food took over an hour and 15 minutes and im still waiting will never order from here again .
fast service clean tasty and authentic its always a good experience visiting vietnam my favorite joint in philly .

great service the food was delicious loved the lamb chops spinach and mash butttttt i got the runs from the food i went thursday its saturday and my system is still messed up very unfortunate because i liked the place a lot .
very nice lunch spot prompt service affordable and tasty food the spring rolls are amazing will definitely be back cant wait to try other things on the menu .
disgusting after 2 hrs wait we found hair in our food and a mouse crawling under the bar stools plus the rudest staff from manager to hostess a disgrace .
great food nice ambiance cheap another great dinner at vietnam .
the painstaking wait is not worth the food they serve here my ny strip was overcooked and not medium rare and since it was served 45 minutes after we had the appetizers they truly fudged up our dining experience nope not going back there .
the food has always been fantastic at vietnam cant beat the quality of food for the price we drive from nj all the time to go here .
maybe ill give them a few more stars when i finally get my food on the corner of impatient and still waiting .
vermacelli with meatballs and spring rolls very good .
food is great we order the veal with chimichurri meat was well cooked tender and tasty dessert was delicious too great atmosphere why just one star the hostess fire her she has no manners people go to restaurants to have fun not to put up with like her .
great deal and good vegetarian options i can eat vietnamese soup again yay .
service is abysmal there is no food worth dealing with this you may read this and think oh but this doesnt really deal with the restaurant itself trust me save yourself a bad time and go somewhere else these people are the worst top to bottom .
ive only been to vietnam rest once but they had me at crispy spring rolls oh yea definitely going back ill come back with a better review later .
never ate here we waited 2 12 hours and ended up waiting over 3 12 hours only to be told it would be 30 min extra they seated parties ahead of us who clearly greased the hostess lesson learned bring a wad of cash .
not as cheap as the vietnamese places on washington between 16th and the italian market but definitely a better atmosphere food is served nearly as soon as you place your order so theres not much time to build up an appetite come hungry .
delivery took over an hour pasta was ok not much flavor garlic knots are also not memorable the marinara sauce that comes with it is awful so watery .
my favorite restaurant in philly the food here is great and i also love the dark shiny wood decor inside the service is also very fast and friendly even when theyre busy and the prices are quite low considering how great everything is i love vietnam .
pizza is always doughy and way over priced the old man who owns it is rude and has no customer service will not be returning when these issues should be standards pizza also sits out a longtime and looks old .
this is one of our favorite places in philadelphia the food is great very reasonably priced and the service is solid i love the lime chicken my wife loves the chicken and broken rice the crispy spring rolls are amazing .
avoid if possible the food is subpar i ordered a regular crust and thin crust both were exactly the same i also ordered a panini it was under cooked and messy i gave this place two tries and they failed horribly on both .
the food is nice the starters are better than the main courses and can fill you up my personal favorite is the meat balls with the rice paper the service is good they will let you sit only once the entire group is present .
nice staff but the pizza was burnt and crunchy prices were reasonable though i dont recommend it though .
never disappointed fave place in nolibs never had anything here that was bad drinks food service always wonderful .
pizza was bland expected more from a brick oven pizzeria the staff was very friendly .
great place kitchy in a good way great great wings good burger good brunch good beers and cocktails just flat out fun and comfortable welcoming to all solid meal value you definitely get what you pay for .
probably the worst calzone ive ever had cold tasteless bland i sent it back to be cooked more or at least microwaved to warm the inside it didnt help although the pizza slices are generous in size the taste isnt we wont go back .
great wings and mac and cheese service was good draft list didnt seem to impress me but they had bells two hearted bottled so i was happy nice cool laid back environment .
the owner was nasty and antagonistic for no reason the pizza was unspectacular and overpriced .
been coming here for the last like 10 years definitely my favorite restaurantbar in philly always consistent food drinks are amazing the crispy chicken sandwich is my go to dish .
unfortunately our dinner took over two hours to come out tables seated 3045 minutes after us ate before we did then my dinner came cold and salty and the steak was tough i wont be back .
roasted chicken mash potato spinach with a mac cheese hands was da bomb a must buy .
8pm reservation 815 ordered food 930pm still havent eaten we left menu was good people nice try hen in the wood its real good .
over all a great experience food was very tasty service was timely and knowledgeable beer selection was top notch and current and the place has some amazing art great place for a date or just grabbing a beer .
i shit you not they served a boiled leek on a plate with a slash of tomato paste enough said best night of the week never .
went to brunch here w my family on a sunday it was the first time for all of us we all enjoyed it good bloody marys i ordered something from the special menu blueberry pancakes topped w whipped ricotta it was amazing friendly waitstaff too no complaints here .
two of the worst steaks ive eaten in my life they are selling flank steaks as prime cuts horribly disappointing would never go back one of the worst meals ive ever had .
great atmosphere and hospitality good beer selections and amazing food best wings i ever had in a long time for amazing food this is the place to be .
this place is highly overrated there is nothing bad except that my pasta a la carbonara was extremely salty but since this is a marios batalis restaurant i expected much more servers were not very attentive .
highly recommend the fried chicken sandwich the fries are pretty legit great vibe and servers are awesome we came on wednesday night and was able to sit down with no wait .
overrated tiny portions bland food mediocre service .
amazing food every time i come here to eat the food is always great i normally get the crispy chicken sandwich or go with the wings but today i finally tried there chicken and waffles and it was really good .
very snobbish waitress and not an accommodating atmosphere food wast all that .
been here twice both times were excellent must say they have awesome buffalo wings all the sandwiches are banging and the portions are generous which is good for me .
gruff for small portions this place used to be amazing with the welcoming aroma of rustic italy now it much more of a snooty fast food joint with rude service and small portions there are many other better places in the area .
always a good time good food good people .
i have been going to this place for 10 years reservation for tomorrow showed up tonight empty and rude hostess would not seat us thanks something about your restaurants everyone has an attitude .
great place food is great i mean really good try the asian wings the dumplings the fish taco specials change everyday great soup .
extremely salty and lousy service .
went there late food was fantastic and the drinks were good and well priced certainly hits the spot .
over rated too expensive ambiance weak service disinterested .
wings are amazing atmosphere is cool and hip sit under the giant boobs .
ill make this short and sweet the service was great but my aglio e olio was too dry to even swallow and i found a fly in my wine .
tomato soup wings and tuna burger were stellar server was your typical overconfident hipster for the area ill come back for the grub .
i was excited this place came to the neighborhood however we went on a friday and service was spotty food was very under seasoned and blah ive been to better mexican restaurants before not going back .
north third is that perfect neighborhood bar it has a good drink wine and beer list while also managing to have some great bar food and a cool atmosphere try the brussel sprouts theyre to die for stop by if youre in the neighborhood ill be back .
ordered mumbai style pav bhaji which looked like mush misal pav was not quite flavorful as we had expected either the appetizer samosa chat was also kind of bland good service but sadly will pass for food next time .
my normal orders include thai wings asian tuna burger with fries drinks arent the best so i stick with beers .
not really up to the challenge i ordered paneer makani and it tasted like raw tomatoes blended with spices and rice was dry warm but dry if you going to eat in then food will come promptly order out good luck .
this is one of our favorite go to places when we dont feel like cooking the burgers are delicious we have had several things on the brunch and dinner menu service is always great .
ownermanager in black shirt on xmas who seated us and rang us up abt 530pm is extremely rude get over yourself have some class and show respect of your patrons everyone else was really nice its not that hard foodwise average nj diner .
best burger great drinks and friendly staff what else do you need .
far from impressed from this standard diner with its old school diner ambiance the service is slow and the food is subpar its your typical diner menu but with more and more diners updating their decor and getting creative with food park west loses to its competition .
the wings here are sooo good stop by just for those i like this place because ive always received very friendly and quick service and everything on the menu has always been solid drinks are okay lovely chill atmosphere i will be back to try out their brunch .
expensive and not good at all the place seems crowded a lot and i see no reason why i had the worst shrimp scampi ive ever had the soup seemed like it came from a package on top of it all my bill was 25 .
i love this place the food the service everything i just love it .
while my friend enjoyed her hamburger my chicken gyro was terrible it arrived cold and dry my waiter was cordial and did return it and it was better on second try but really still poor very disappointing .
brunch .
typical diner but for some reason this place kinda skeeves me out i cant place my finger on it though food is decent but didnt blow me away by any means there are a ton more diners that do it better in the area .
north third was exceptionally accommodating to last minute party of 12 everyone was very friendly and helpful the food is delicious too .
foods gone down hill in the past year or so .
blt sandwich bufflo wings never go wrong drinks are great margarita stoli doli bloody mary .
somehow unlike alot of other reviews i have negative comments last time i ate hear an i had the heman breakfast i was sick for more than 24 hours 2 people i know have gotten food poisoning from here last year ill never eat there again .
this is my favorite gastropub restaurant and i compare every gastropob to their high standards go here bring everyone you know here boobs to the wall amazing the end .
yuck i have never had pizza cooked from a conveyer belt oven before and never will again sloppy mess pizza .
the food and drink options are good the atmosphere is dark with very eccentric decor that really makes the place the service has always been great every time i have eaten there its not my first choicego to restaurant in northern liberties but it is definitely up there .
was sat at a table inside and was fighting flies for the provided stale bread and wine saw at least 20 flies on the wall adjacent to the table no thanks .
great food good vibe thai wings are awesome .
the pizza is okay but it would be a lot better if theyd crank up the oven a little they keep it at about 400f which isnt hot enough for the crust to set up properly .
great eccentric bar we always order the bibb salad with grilled chicken probably one of the best burgers in philly with great beer on tap welcoming local joint to walk to in northern liberties or when you want to venture out of your neighborhood .
ignore this review was meant for china gourmet in hk .
best thai wings ever cool decor .
we took our parents here and my mom had one crystal shrimp dumpling and immediately said dont eat anything with shrimp in it it tastes like bleach i tried it and yes it definitely tasted like bleach .
awesome place to go with a couple friends this place is not a party atmosphere really unique chill place i will definitely go here again if im in the area .
the search continues for a great chinese place closer to home .
this spot is one of my favorites in northern liberties a ton of beers and pretty solid food ive also never had a bad experience service wise i would suggest it if you were with a group of friends and just want a casual night .
never again i ordered take out from this place a few nights ago and everything sucked the duck had too much salt the sesame chicken had too much sugar and their lo mein had canned mushrooms in it really not worth it .
i love this bar the food boozebeer selection and staff are all great this is one of my favorite neighborhood places .
food was ok not great but not horrible had the chicken quesadilla with corn flour was more like tacos with cheese warmed up my friend has the pollo adobo it was just ok woman serving us was nice though would probably not come back to eat here .
ive been back here several times over the course of the last year food is consistent with flavors the wait is still unsteady along with their service but i always end up leaving pleased because of their unique menus that i get to indulge in .
delicious mexican food especially fresh tasting however the customer service is poor hostesscashier is very rude .
decent place to grab a bite get the asian chickenbuffalo wings .
the hostess was very unprofessional and rude for bringing her problems into work with her .
food 5 decor 4 ambiance 5 service 4 value 5 .
this place is not too far from my place so i didnt have to walk too far for it tried three different dishes everything was mediocre very very average i dont know how this place gets such a high rating strange .
the decor is amazing i will upload some pics drinks were not water down food was out of this world service was perfect .
bad service mediocre food and dirty plates not impressed with any thing going on here wouldnt visit again .
great dinner specials cool vibe .
why has it been 1 hour and 30 min for a pizza and salad to get delivered to my house on a tuesday this is stupid and im hungry dont count on them .
this place is consistently great the specials are always interesting and it is the kind of place where you can order anything and know it will be great very eclectic divey decor service is always good and the beer list is excellent this is a cant miss place .
solid pizza but my friend and i both got the seafood pasta dish yada yada yada ive been on the toilet 25 times a day for 3 days my friend threw up at work an hour after eating it conclusion dont get anything but pizza here ever .
please get the tuna burger it is out of this world good rare of course yes it is that good .
the food was just ok maybe a notch above olive garden i was enticed by the convenient location and the large weekday lunch specials theres far better italian food to be had in a small radius of this place no complaints about the service though .
go here for dates great food drinks atmosphere dont be hesitant to try any of the specials i surely did not regret anything that i got here .
yuck i saw bug crawling on the walls .
shared two apps pork carnets and calamari both flavorful and plentiful the tuna burger medium rare was absolutely delish while hubby enjoyed the fried fish blt i really like this menu and cant wait to come back to sample the cobb salad mussels etc service quick and friendly .
this is a review for takeout this past weekend we picked up a pizza and calzone and neither of us cared for the food pizza had a sweet taste havent had other food from there expensive takeout i wont have again .
i used to get the burger here w each visit but lately the fish and chips have been calling my name fun atmosphere great for catching a game w some friends consistently superior service and great specials .
pretty good food but their staff is rude and ignorant .
the service atmosphere and food were excellent great beers on tap a definite place to go to .
went here for a coworker lunch it was pretty substandard italian food the pizza was greasy the salads were over dressed and the pasta unpalatable i went there once and honestly do not understand the hype .
just a few things to say yum yum yum yum yum always good special cocktails always yummy as well only annoying thing is brunch seems to get packed and doesnt end until pretty late and i cant get the dinner menu .
the pizza was eh and the service was horrible guess when your used to having great pizza its hard to eat a place that doesnt at least wow you with service when the food was mediocre .
north third never fails i have been there dozens of times for breakfast lunch and dinner and have savored every meal perfectly its simple attentive servers spontaneous specials great restaurant the boobs on the wall are just an added bonus .
theres way better pizza in philly were not talking ny quality here but its out there dont buy into the coal oven hype its not all that the cheese is good but the sauce and crust just dont hold up .
loved the service and had a nice vibe the wings were delicious the asian style ones enjoyed the beet salad and the softshell crab special was yummy the fried chicken cobb salad looked great coming out of the kitchen as well .
food is just 100 meh great beer selection happy hour so id go again for drinking similar to other peoples experience the food took forever and was average at best .
ive been back several times now and can say the food is consistently delicious and now after trying various brunch cocktails amazing who needs to go wait for an hour or more down the block at honeys .
the best way to describe the office is tgi fridays with bad service and bland food i know there are a couple of offices in nj but i didnt expect for it to feel like a chain restaurant i should have went to a diner instead .
consistently good and creative food funky atmosphere and mix of people .
i went to lunch today and had to return the fish chips entree it smelled like ammonia they took it off the bill but my lunch was ruined and i hope no one else orders that fish i guess i wont be returning there soon .
really enjoyed this place everyone at the table was thrilled with their orders i had the wings which were definitely spicier than i expected but still among the best ive had in philly very nice atmosphere .
probably one of the worst i have tried anywhere the service was abysmal the food was passable and the ambiance was unlike any bargrill more of a diner on a highway .
best hummus you cant go wrong with anything offered off their menu and the margaritas are so good i wish we had one in passyunk square .
you might get food poisoning here and the crowd is terrible but they have decent beer on tap ok in a pinch .
same review of the food and drink as below but i did go again on a friday night same server same extremely slow wait time to get service from him .
service was very good here but food was not beer is served in a water glass had a grilled chicken caesar salad lettuce was a little brownish had a appetizer chicken wings and things just not good desert was fine a chocolate explosion very good .
best bloody marys in the city .
not impressed wasnt the worst thing ive ever ate terrible wait staff steak was over done got a good beer but thats easy the one in morristown is better by far .
north 3rd is one of my favourite places in my neighborhood its amazing that a small bar has such outstanding food great fish dishes bread pudding and micro brew specials everyday great brunch on the weekends really amazing for a small neighborhood bar .
the food was horrible and so was our waitress the other ones im positive are better but unfortunately ours sucked its just all very amateur here blame it on aziz ansari but i dont think ill ever eat here again on purpose .
you can find places like this in the small neihborhoods all over philly this one is one of the better gastro pubs i have been to cheap drinks and great food to go with it its a bit loud but the sevice was fast and friendly .
food less than desirable canned product for sure service friendly sounds lame there is surround music and jukebox music that play at the same time annoying .
great neighborhood pub where everything exceeds you expectations truthfully nothing pops on the menu so you usually fall back on a dish that promises mediocrity then ends up delivering the goods the biscuits and sausage gravy are no joke great beer menu too .
the bread is great everything else is overrated and overpriced huge building and not much in the deli ill take shoprite in west caldwell over calandras also the new sign is gody and unnecessary .
great neighborhood spot if you find yourself in the area be sure to stop in for a pint we didnt eat but sampled some unique brews including offerings from dark horse in marshall mi nice vibe here .
another year another price raise now 9 99 i havent been in a while but quality isnt as good as i remember also deli sandwich menu was taken down so had to make one on spot guess thats can be a good thing or a bad thing .
north third is one of those bars where you can return again and again because the beer selection is satisfying and the food classic suggest the wings asian or buffalo any soup pork tacos and the mussels great place for a first date or a 40th date .
i was disappointed in their italian hot dog sandwich today it did not have enough hot dog everything else was good the service was god and sitting out on their veranda was great on such a nice day .
ate outside with my family great menu variety and really good tasting food .
had the worst food poisoning in my life after eating here puked my guts out and diarrhea it doesnt even deserve one star .
love the beer selection the ambience and the food outdoor seating is cool if the weather cooperates too .
nothing to tell your friends about great home baked bread for appetizer the pasta was mediocre and the quality and taste do not match the over priced menu definitely not a 4 star maybe 3 star 2 starts is a good fit for them .
someone told me this was a dive its hip but not a total dive at all had fun didnt eat drank some and i would go back .
the pizza fiorentina was pretty disappointing the crust was horrible it had zero flavor and tasted as though it had been frozen the toppings though were ok however nothing special this place seems to do better with their pastas but i wont be back .
this place should be on diners drive throughs and dives what great food even foodies will enjoy it definitely check it out .
service was quick and the food came right away but we had the mussels and clams as an appetizer and it was lukewarm when the entrees came they were hot but the taste was mediocre at best our pasta was hard and the lobster crab ravioli was powdery .
took outof town family who loved the food as a vegetarian its sometimes hard to get a kitchen to accommodate special requests food was very good service place was busy was prompt and not pushy bartenders music mix added to the overall fun we all had .
hostess was a nazi extremely rude dont bother with this place .
beer pairing on wednesday night this week april 27th was out of this world everything was perfect the plates and the beers balanced perfectly my friend wanted seconds well done .
attitude is unbelievable .
i read all the reviews on yelp before comign here with my girlfriend for dinner all i can see is holy crap the food was orgasmic especially the baked macaroni and the drinks were fun i would def come back .
just ok service is pretty fast once seated if youre in a hurry and just need something then this might work for you tourist trap .
awesome staff awesome beer awesome decor incredible burger only thing id change add a little more lighting even if just to the individual tables this was one of those places where i had to whip out my cell phone to illuminate the menu .
this restaurant has a fabulous selection of pasta but if for some reason you dont eat pasta stay away .
this is a great location for sunday brunch if you want to avoid long lines at other nearby restaurantsbars this is a great alternative low key not too crowded and a diverse menu they serve a terrific mulled wine .
terrible service solid food waiters are clueless and drinks are watered down will not return .
awesome .
this place was terrible way over priced bad service and they have a very limited menu not to mention they were out of half of the menu options when we went there are much better restaurant choices and we are sorry we wasted an evening here .
the first time i went i hated the service if you were not part of the in crowd you were made to feel like you did not belong but now it is great my kids love breakfast large french toast they even accommodate people with celiac great place .
really lousy food and i dragged my two new yorker friends there after seeing the rave reviews it was completely empty when we got there and when we left only one other straggler in the restaurant never again .
one of my fave neighborhood bars i like to bring all my dates here love their brunch too they get my vote for favorite bloody mary favorite bread pudding .
not a reorder .
great bar food lager and awesome service what more can you ask for oh amazing decor you say check they got it in a city of haters this place stands out as being friendly and it doesnt hurt your wallet highly recommended .
food was salty and not especially creative the ambiance is pleasant and the service was polite but slow .
one of my nolibs favs consistently good food great wings brunch menu selection and nice draught beer selection .
service was very slow and then they automatically added a 20 tip to the bill so even though the food was ok i will not be coming back here again .
this is my favorite place to eat in town the crowd is cool the lighting is flattering the food is divine any soup is a great bet the clams special is a favorite and their hanger steak is juicy and delicious love the artistic flare .
the price is right and its a laid back atmosphere but the oxtail ragu dish didnt live up to the hype .
although every part of the service was appalling i noticed this at other tables besides mine also last night i have to bump the food up a notch here very good .
their bad service is greater than the goodness of their brunch the server i had was so rude i was scared of him never coming back douces .
best wings ever original or asian inspired fingerlicking good choc chip bread pudding is not to be missed .
it sux dont waste ur money .
lightning fast service delicious food great atmosphere .
terrible food although hear that non vegetarian options are good surprisingly less vegetarian options for an indian restaurant .
easily the best burgers in all of philly actually ive never had a bad meal here the only problem is that parking is a pain in the ass but that goes without saying in no libs and sometimes theres a long wait for a table .
i dont get it this was horrible overpriced and reminds me of the soup nazibut i think they had good soup dont bother .
due to frequent shifts in chefs i steered away from north third for a while but for the last year things have been spot on delicious hearty reasonably priced meals a top pick for casual dinner in northern liberties .
overpriced undercooked condimentlacking burger joint the point is that its supposedly the birthplace of the burger but id imagine whoever came up with the second burger rather than the first has a better one than here yuck .
north third has a decent selection of quality beer at an affordable price the atmosphere is fun and interesting i would highly recommend this bar if youre in the area .
we went on a saturday no matter how good the burger if it is 50 minutes waiting time its not worth it .
i came here about a year and a half ago they had a seared tuna that was amazing i checked their menu recently and it looked like they dont make it anymore definitely some interesting decor but the food is right on id like to go back sometime .
stopped by when i took a trip to boston was i disappointed the meat is dry and disgusting on dry toast then they insult you when you mention ketchup for their dry and disgusting meat the best way to describe the burger is garbage .
the place has everything neighborhoody eclectic decor and tasty food but to top it all they passed the supreme test fish is not fried in their fish tacos bravo .
if you must not much flavor but lots of history i wont be back .
great place one of phillys original gastro pub unpretentious casual atmosphere can pull of sophisticated dishes not only your basic bar fare though their burgers are pretty great try the wings .
the burger didnt impress me they are really proud of their history and want to stay true to their roots but really the food wasnt worth it the burger was a piece of ground beef cooked rare with a slice of tomato in two pieces of white toast .
still one of my favorite spots hands down atmosphere is great food is even better recommend this to everyone that steps foot into northern liberties .
the burgers are honestly just ok nothing special and while it may be a novelty of sorts that they are served on toast i wasnt wild about it sorry .
being able to buy a liter of duvel would have sold me just on its own but then the french fries and the lentil soup two of my favorite foods on the planet and the fact that it feels like el dia de los muertos in here amazing .
if taken for face value this is a pretty average burger the place doesnt have condiments they only sell burgers i mean its an american landmark but does that translate to good quality food and service in the current economy .
this place was my introduction to philly and after 3 years its one of my favorite places great food drinks and atmosphere .
nice history cute little place but burgers were bland sorry head to caseus or prime 16 if u crave for burger .
how i love thee affordable yummy food blood orange margaritas are ohso satisfying id eat there every day if i could i think i did for a while .
waited two hours to get burgers that were bland and definitely not worth the wait i will never go there again dont buy into the tv hype .
chillest bar in philly great food brunch is excellent friendly service .
just close already .
very eclectic diverse menu check wacky interesting decor check independent movie night check the only problem is that it can get a little bit crowded when the late night drinking crowd moves in go visit youll like it .
so excited to be there and then it was time to eat very upset that the burger lacked any flavor at all .
they have my favorite beer on tap its a microbrew out of baltimores brewers art called the resurrection lots of yummy food on the menu to accompany it and the ambiance is dark and sexy .
it is just worth because of historic value people are rude place is too small and burgers are ok .
the best wings in philly .
its a burger on two slices of bread i enjoyed mine with cheese and an orange soda .
5 stars for monster marys alone the food is also great but that mary is all i need .
by all means go and see histrory take outoftowners but every once in a while is enough for me 5 years ask for ketchup and see what happens .
love the food especially the desserts great bar to drink and hang out w friends .
5 stars for history 1 stars for being a burger on white bread yes everyone should experience louis lunch at least once and i dont doubt that some people actually likelove it but not me .
great food but a little pricey i like to go from time to time as a treat outside seating in the summer the burgers rock .
very mysterious how in the world can a restaurant that sells overcooked golfballtough meat spheres on toast stay in business let alone be so popular very mysterious .
my favorite place for brunch equally for their food and their bloody maries the best ive ever had and they come in pint glasses they have great burgers and soup too this place really makes me miss philly .
gross overly hyped terrible service 2 hour wait waste of time and obviously bad for your health .
great fried calamari crispy and seasoned great pizza definitely worth a visit byob and good service .
no personality in the servers or flavor in their food extremely disappointed and the prices are a bit steep for the atmosphere and there is no bar will not return .
great authentic pizza and they deliver which is unheard of in these parts service when you eat in is decent the servers are sometimes moody but they are usually teenagers so understandable to me anyway .
dont ever come here 35 minutes waiting and watching tables sat after us get their food with no news from the staff menu was nothing special and not cheap ive never walked out on a restaurant before but theres a first time for everything .
great service great food and even better pizza definietely tried it out i love their vodka sauce .
very overrated long wait for not so excellent food im from california and i eat better at our food trucks than at raymonds long wait a wait staff that could care less and beware that when you order anything with advocate it is more like packaged guacamole .
very nice light italian dinner with my lovely wife .
smallest table in the world meatloaf that tasted like spam and i nearly broke a tooth on the bread that came with the artichoke dip enough said .
everything i had was really good waiter was nice and recommended some good dishes braised short rib was very good would go back again soon .
ive never really understood why there is so much hype for this place the food is good but nothing out of this world it is extremely over priced for what it is and ive never had a great experience with the service much better options in montclair .
best burger i have ever tried awesome atmosphere and really inventive cocktails .
last time i went to this place with my family the food was decent i ordered pancakes and it tasted well not impressive because its normal plain my mother cooks better pancakes .
this is comfort food central the kale salads always a requirement i feel back home when im here and have had some great memories definitely a place for a date or visiting family no one can say they cant find a dish seatings competitive but the bars easy .
well its convenient when in the area thats it food is less than sub par theyv get the hungry out of default no other nearby gave it a few trys still nope rather be hungry kids meal was huge but who wants more of the blahhhh .
great place for brunch or lunch i ordered poached fried rice kale salad and washed it down with french pressed coffee the ambiance is rustic yet modern and the staff very friendly .
bar and atmosphere is good but food is not very thai too saucy and bland i had basil chili chicken and there was no perceptible basil but zuchini slices yuk if i go there again i would ask them to prepare in traditional thai manner not bayonne manner .
good quality food and a popular spot for brunch and dinner portion sizes tend to fall on the smaller side the restaurant fills up quite quickly the dining experience is done well place has got a hipster vibe fitting for the neighborhood .
the beers and the music were excellent the food taste like chinese take out .
favorite spot in ny .
nothing spectacular cheaply made food but they charge you a fortune tried it twice and neither time was anything to brag about .
excellent food great bunch spot and quality of food .
greasy gross no authentic thai so it seems i went a while ago and asked for kee mao and i got a confused look again if your into a greasy mess of a meal go for it .
the sunday special is a 3 course meal that is dandy loved the food everything was seasoned perfectly the service was excellent and attentive you do get really close to your neighboring tables but that can lead to fun conversations too .
only thing worth going for is the filipino chickenwaffles however this last i came i was disappointed waffles were way overbooked hard and tough to eat .
great service and food was incredible the duck breast and duck fries were top notch and though the restaurant is small it provides a great intimate experience need to try the brunch .
arroz caldo was good but they give you a small size for 9 the tocinosilog was dry and not authentic overall this place is not good if youre looking for an authentic filipino place queens has better filipino food .
pros super cute farmtotable high quality food cons long wait but what restaurant in nyc doesnt have a wait small portions .
what can i say price for the food ridiculous food was decent but for the price next .
yelp never lets me down the rant and rave about the kale salad is true its simply delightful i also got a strawberry rhubarb mimosa that was very lovely ill definitely be back .
food was just ok the flies did not make my meal any more appetizing .
awesome waitress named summer in a vegan and she helped me find the delicious strawberry salad right off and guided me through ingredients i didnt recognize you go girl .
get to the chase pros 1 great service quick polite and friendly cons 1 not impressed 2 food wasnt anything new or special 3 was empty at 500 pm and the veggies looked overdone 4 not worth the 90 for 4 people .
came here for brunch on a weekday on a reco from a friend would recommend this to others great food good prices over great vibe although the chairs were uncomfortable .
first the portion was too small this s not french resto second the sisig was so disappointing ugh third it is expensive again this s not a french resto so stop pretending hmmmp .
great farm to table seasonal choices good sized portions for the price friendly and knowledgeable staff interesting and unique menu items a small romantic spot hidden away in the bustle of the east village .
i liked the staff at this joint and the food was good but expensive for for what you get filipino food is usually half the price and you get more bang for the buck elsewhere oh if you want good drinks for cheap come on by .
awesome food and really cool ambiance great date night spot .
kimchi grill is disappointing its another one of those kimchi gimmicks floating around in ny .
the biscuits are to die for actually everything is good ive only eaten brunch here but never had a bad meal i come every time im in nyc .
inconsistency at its best sometimes 5 stars sometimes 0 put some meat on your stuff that says it has meat atleast try to send it warm order somewhere else in desperation this place is ok if youre willing to roll the dice .
weekday brunch with a friend means no wait sit as long as you want quick delivery of famed kale salad said kale salad is refreshing salted with pecorino and toasted almonds sweetened with roasted butternut squash and filling dt two baked eggs .
the saddest looking and dullest tasting tortillas from here to korea squeeze all joy and life out of any meats or vegetables inserted into them not returning .
place is awesome .
the food was delivered cold and i live maybe 5 mins away and even though i specifically asked for no beans in my burrito the thing was slathered in beans very disappointed .
probably my favorite restaurant in the neighborhood consistently great food and service wether for dinner brunch or their special dining events .
good food no bathroom its terrible to eat good food and not be able to pee .
great service incredible food recommend the winter squash dairy free with the pork to share best plates i had in nyc in a while original flavorful recommended .
im sorry but mexican korean are nice in theory but in actuality it totally missed the mark its bland overpriced onions with a pinch of food added extremely disappointed .
buttermilk biscuit and kale salad were fantastic enough for me to walk the miles from the union square train station again .
i wanted to love it here but there was a piece of plastic in my taco .
food was really good tried the cheese egg with grits and the southern fried rice dont get the pork sticky rolls though the contrast between sugared glaze and the mustarded pork was really weird wait was 40 mins long though and it was really cold today .
terrible service the trashy short lady is rude giving you dirty looks and just stare at you like really hellllllllooo why are you even here their hot chocolate was terrible so i rather walk farther to starbucks than giving them money or see that rude a b .
fantastic meal absolutely fantastic warm squid salad was exceptional tuscan kale salad was fresh balanced bread was ok striped bass was amazing the waffle dessert with ice cream was badass .
went today grabbed a bunch of bagels to go service is crap and rude my order was screwed up top to bottom and the pig couldnt keep his eyes and comments out of the young ladies curves who is managing this sleaze .
northern spy has a cozy atmosphere thats great for a brunch between friends and im sure other meals as well kale salad with clothbound cheddar was amazing and actually cured my hangover .
no liquid sugar dissolved sugar for the iced coffee service is slow their everything bagel has salt on it makes a difference compared to dunkin donuts would prefer manhatten bagel compared to this but dd has more locationsconvenient .
i rarely give restaurants a full 5 stars but spy gets my vote because the food is so fresh inventive and eye appealing service is friendly and the neighborhood is funky and interesting this is the restaurant i select when its my birthday .
disappointing went there twice service was terrible my latte was horribly prepared and the server spilled it all over the cup even the bagels are not specially good .
killer food killer service order biscuits .
phone girl answered said were closed then hung up my family orders from here at least three or four times a month well used to i am tired of their long wait times and rude employees .
two words sunday supper .
dirty bar atmosphere and very low class clientele if you want a cheap bar night with low grade beer then it may be for you the food is terrible .
great food i would definitely eat here again service is friendly however food can be slow to come and the waitresses lose track of orders due to apparent understaffing .
french onion soup was good worst ribs ive ever had service was soso big tell that the restaurant is empty at 8pm .
the kale salad with baked eggs is ridiculously good typically a long wait on the weekend but worth it never a disappointment they dont deliver on weekends .
pretty laid back atmosphere food is decent and prices arent bad the bartenders were friendly so i can see myself coming back .
my sister gave me a gift certificate so we went for dinner one night recommend the kale salad and the pork sticky buns both really good small restaurant and a bit out of the way but worth the trip .
good service but bad food menu is too big i had the salmon burger and i should have cooked my own frozen burger patty fries were okay i like well done ones so at least i could eat something on my plate .
excellent service and food each dish is presented like a work of art i particularly enjoyed the salmon and squid salad the berry financier dessert was perfect as well highly recommended .
stopped here to get a meal instead of nj turnpike rest stop food this wasnt much better actually the greek salad would have been decent if they didnt smother and soak it in the dressing the wings were ok the margaritas were awful .
only been here for brunch definitely get the kale salad its to die for also if you want a drink get the fuji apple mimosa .
looks pleasant from the outside but this is not a restaurant its disgustingly dirty emits random smells and the food is abysmal wouldnt even call this a dive bar its an episode of kitchen nightmare waiting to happen .
order the corned beef hash biscuits and apple cider you do that and i guarantee you will love this place .
i got sick as a dog after eating their fried clams i will not go back again ever .
im kind of obsessed with the kale salad plus the sunny side up eggs .
terrible place dont go i was served either reheated or overdone scallops which tasted burnt they looked reheatedrecycled my son had a chicken parm sub which was very tough and chewy very disappointed .
pork sticky buns dying everything was great corned beef hash biscuits staff definitely great brunch .
the view the water thats it the creemee is nothing to write home about .
fantastic place for brunch the wait is a little long but the food made up for it i highly recommend the biscuits kale salad with eggs and their grapefruit mimosa .
yeah the spot is cute and the service is really nice but for me this was mediocre japanese food cool concept to serve japanese breakfast dishes but it seems as if the chef doesnt taste his own cooking almost all the small dishes were underseasoned and bland .
the food is amazing i had the roasted chicken and it was the best chicken ive ever had and the gnocchi was to die for i only wish they put more gnocchi in the dish .
that used to be one of my favorite restaurants unfortunately these days the food is so mediocre i do not recommend this place .
probs the best brunch i ever had damn that kale salad cereal and polenta were good .
disappointing tiramisu and the smallest scoop of ice cream ive ever seen maybe thats due to it being half melted when it arrived seriously how can you make disappointing tiramisu anything really is possible .
came for the brunch it was really cute and good had to wait about 40 minutes for a table but all things considered it wasnt too bad service was good bloody marys were nice and spicy .
its too bad because its a great location and a nice spot but its just not good drinks fine and beer and wine list good food hit or miss and expensive for what it is not something to return to .
amazing brunch the kale salad was the best ive ever had make sure to add eggs to it the polenta with eggs is creamy and full of flavor sat on some very very uncomfortable stools but everything else was incredible .
i was served a salad with slimy lettuce leaves all im saying is that if you pay 6 bucks for a small plate of greens they should have the care to take out any slimy lettuce .
excellent great vibe great food had the kale and almond salad which was killer and then the carrot entree with barley which is insanely good ill be back alot .
the only reason to go here is to be seen super expensive yet absolute garbage crostini was so hard i think it must have been made with viagra sent it back and waited 20 minutes when i asked what happened the server said stuff happens .
really cute place with great food healthy too would definitely go back the gnocchi were phenomenal and the kalefluke lived up to the yelp hype .
the actual restaurant is good drinks food and occasional live music the clientele is pretentious and irritating which ultimately ruins the bar for everyone other than the dartmouth crowd .
this is my new favorite restaurant the trout was great the chicken was the best ive ever had ever the kale salad was great the chicken liver mousse was great im going back asap .
slow service cooking was basic and unexciting my soup and main course came out too cold on the plus side there is a nice beer list heavy on local micros .
i woke up this morning still thinking about the shrimp with delicious celery root sauce i just want to eat it all the time service was good place is cozy on a cold winter night and if you head there late on a sunday no wait .
lovely place but must have just been a bad day or something because unlike the great reviews on yelp i had bad service horrible food even worse coffee dont think i will be coming back the only decent thing was the glass of water the fruit bowl .
really great spot priced are fair my favorite dish was the kale salad it was delish we had to wait about 30 mins for a seat not to bad though we wil absoljtly be back .
no ac really crowded they didnt get us bread food took like 45 min it tasted good but was an uncomfortable brunch atmosphere overall .
love it for brunch the kale salad with baked eggs is to die for so are the homemade biscuits with maple butter and the brunch cocktails are tasty and fun dont go there because i want to keep it secret so i can always get a table .
french onion soup delicious service horrible horrible horrible .
amazing .
we waited over 45 mins to get our food we also had to ask for bread while everyone around us was getting baskets of it without asking the food was just meh and my husband and i ended up having some stomach issues after we ate .
2 words kale salad i regularly come here for their coffee and its i think the best coffee in the east village no joke and the kale salad is heavenly and the ambienceservice is seriously cute and awesome go .
i came here on a sunday brunch not impressed with their service nor their foods i dont know whats the fuss with this place .
foodgasm love this place will go every time im in ny dont miss brunch .
this was pretty yucky i mean not horrific but definitely not good the crepe was spongy and weird the salad tasted literally like dirt and was an extremely strange combination of flavors the service was definitely not attentive i would not go back .
thank you northern spy for turning me onto kale everything on the menu was delicious and i like that it evolves with seasonal ingredients i will be back to try bruch and fall fares .
not good a chimichanga whose main ingredient is mashed potatoes also had the chili fries which were decent but very greasy the cornbread was excellent .
great food chilled watercress soup and kale made good compliments to each other for an appetizer if you want to try different things the lamb and the scallops were excellent too .
after i asked a waitress for a glass of water and she replied i can get your waitress i cant remember what my food was like .
enjoyed a delicious brunch here with friends a few weeks ago the food was great and the prices werent awful we had the biscuits baked eggs the polenta eggs and the baconeggs the only draw back was that they were out of bloody mary ingredients .
if you want real mexican food go elsewhere the tamales were horribly salty and lack any real flavor head downtown to maderas .
i took the suggestion from the couple next to us to get the kale salad eggs and a side of biscuits and bacon it was the perfect brunch it wasnt a bad wait on mothers day weekend either only 1520mins or so great spot .
ok ive only been here once but that was enough the food was not good enough said you might as well walk over to chilis instead that seems more mexican than this place .
this is my husband and is favorite resturaunt in the city delicious farm to table meals and amazing desserts make a reservation on weekends it gets crowded .
sucks sucks sucks fish market in tijuana is better than this slop so bad i wont give it the respect of a thourough review fk this place .
great brunch .
brunch was decent came here before the po by was good i would stick to the pancakes or anything but the eggs .
excellent food loved everything ive eaten there great quality vegetables and meats local grass fed organic etc totally recommendable .
one star plus for the food sausage po boy mac and cheese red beans and rice feh if youre stuck in the neighborhood an additional star for the service .
the food and decor makes this place worth coming to again and again we started with the flat bread then went with the fluke and shrimp entrees everything was good but we thought the fluke was more amazing than the other two dishes .
i was looking forward to something more authentic food was okay not great but the service was awful just the absolute worst .
tiny place but not unlike most in the neighborhood the menu tastes better than it reads the food is well thought out and simple but done well a bit on the trendy side but i have been back a couple of times only beer and wine to drink .
service friendly atmosphere cool drinks fine food had me running back and forth to the bathroom the food wasnt great but try for urself if i come back it would be for the drinks only .
the food is so good and service is attentive just wish i dont have to wait so much for dinner on weekends ha .
the food was overprice and bland trying to be creative but failed miserably at least that night the service was somewhat annoying trying too many times to collect our dishes before we were done .
food was great my portion was small could have eaten another item .
not a memorable meal drinks so so only 5 stars for service though they even gave us a free round of drinks toward the end great location in tribeca has potential but food and drink needs to be better .
referred by a friend when prune didnt work out along with the attentive service the food we ordered was great biscuits blood orange mimosas chicken and egg sandwich polenta and eggs brunch priced just right too .
stay away from the sushi i love sushi however if this place had been my first experience with sushi i would never become a fan other than that the food is okay especially when your in an hurry and searching for a healthier alternative .
excellent brunch ive also been there for dinner as well food is great high quality comfort food for brunch the top two items are the homemade corn beef hash and the sausage gravy with biscuits the decor and environment is very charming and comfy good date spot .
after hearing that this was one of connecticuts best italian restaurants my companion and i were deeply disappointed my pasta was undercooked and his veal over salted quite frankly we have had better italian meals at bertuccis .
kale salad super yum overall it is super cute fresh ingredients very friendly and unpretentious staff .
more of a status restaurant dont expect much for your dollar dont wear jeans and sneakers or youll get ugly looks from the welltodo regulars .
great local neighborhood eatery best brunch in the east village if you order the biscuits make sure ask for an extra pot of jam .
decent food disappointing service tight but decent bar area uppity attitude that did not sit well with myself or others i have gone with for great italian food i prefer francescos down the road for classic italian food and more reasonable pricing .
this is why you go back to restaurants and dont judge them right when they open they improve northern spy is a standout in quality and value a great choice around the holidays as well well priced prix fixe that lets you celebrate without breaking the bank .
after high recommendations i was disappointed caesar salad tasted like they forgot to put the dressing on it service was slow and the bottle of wine we ordered never showed up the hanger steak special was the highlight of the visit .
solid brunch option in ev recommended dishes include biscuits and gravy and eggs with polenta french toast looked amazing but they ran out .
the service here is so bad food is ok i wont be back they need to train there waiters to give the guest attention and make sure they have everything they need the busboys and runners should be the waiters they are niceri .
food was amazing breaded pork was maillardd to perfection fries good but wouldnt order them again beer was cheap during happy hour place got packed fast .
horrible service cramped when busy cash only .
ups close to me brunch biscuits corn beef mimosa kale salad overall vibestaff downs can be a wait for brunch communal tables overall one of my favorite brunch spots its a top 3 in alphabet cityev on par with back 40 and mud .
regular place not much to say about it i went tonight because it had good reviews in yelp but i dont agree .
amazing dinner striped bass pork lamb locally sourced were all delicious as was crispy gnocchi and salads attentive wait staff and delightful atmosphere .
ok italian food calamari was good wines were ok mussels were good i had a mushroom paperdelle which was decent the tagliatelle was eh the lasagna was eh small place but they did try their best to make it comfortable cool name .
everything was very tasty gnocchi was great and i know gnocchi beet salad was awesome loved the goat cheese highly recommend .
food is fine very loud and always crowded not a very comfortable dining experience .
the best brunch ever .
i was so excited to try this place until i sat at our table to check out the menu and a cockroach crawled across my plate setting we immediately left ick .
great dishes good coffee and nice atmosphere with local emphasis i particularly recommend their lamb burger i think its one of the best in nyc .
no no 11 for one piece of eggplant as an appetizer i am so sorry you made a big mistake here and lost my business and anyone else i would have taken to lea .
little pricy for strange reason you can get breakfast type dinner and the lunch best deal is lamb burger very yammiiii .
been here a few times and i want to like it but every time the food has been unimpressive and overpriced and the staff has been smarmy and inattentive had a particularly rude bartender today think im done hoping this place will get better .
great food staff could be better recommend berry seltzer bloody mary french toast side of bacon .
ugh poor service over priced blah food avoid outdoor seating is nice if having only drinks .
northern spy is fantastic in just about every way and then theres the fact that they serve the very best gnocchi i have ever had in my life one note the cocktails are delicious but they do not have liquor so dont come hoping for a sazerac .
brunch was shabby and overpriced i ordered a salad with trout poached eggs and root vegetables i could not find the trout but there was a lot of radishes oh and i could not taste the coffee over the radishes because it was soo weak .
the waitress who served me here was among the best ive ever had knew a lot about everything on the menu including the ingredients in each of the drinks and was able to describe them in lots of helpful details the food was down to earth but delicious .
terribly slow service misadvertised prices mediocre food we went for the seashore bbq event and the only reason i didnt give 1 star is because the guy manning the grill did it well his food was good the stuff brought from the kitchen was bad .
this place is awesome kale salad is a must side notealittle noiseycrowded but still a good dinning xperience .
food is good the service is not so good and watch the billing is shady especially when it comes to the brunch drink menu because of the billing issues and the suspect service they wont be getting my business again .
duck fat fries are superb i had the special pork cut of the day and it was wellflavored but the texture was quite tough overall a very enjoyable restaurant though .
mediocre i had a chicken breast and it was overcooked and dried throughout the rice also isnt good quality and they put butter all over their food .
northern spy is a reasonably priced restaurant that features the only thing that matters good sustainable food my waiter was also sweet and attentive without being too invasive plus the place feels like a charming barn i grabbed some delicious saltwater taffy as desert .
the service was terrible our host had the most terrible attitude and barely helped us my food was ok but my friends food wasnt the steak had a very burnt taste i wouldnt go back best part about it was the music .
really really good coffee must get their biscuits the best biscuits ive ever had everything here is fresh and simple .
came here for my friends bday it was quiet an experience and i would definitely come back .
one of my favorite spots in the east village when im not looking for ramen ive been here three times and im always amazed simple and delicious farm to table food you can really taste the diference in the fresh ingredients a great cozy atmosphere as well .
i ordered a sandwich cubano probably not the best dish out of the menu but it was recommended by a friend the sandwich itself was good but it was served with rock hard fried banana chips service was good otherwise .
great brunchworth the wait the egg and kale salad is off the chain .
1 when we were first sat the staff was in the middle of breaking up a fight amongst staff members 2 the food took forever to come out 3 the food was super plain and had deli mustard on it i ordered the restaurant special cubano sandwich .
amazing brunch some of the best biscuits ever slow whisked scrambled eggs were really good like cheesy buttery grits cool place and staff my new favorite brunch spot .
the food was average the music rocked .
everything i tried at this place was delicious the service was great the atmosphere nice but relaxed the food american with a refined taste for flavor and texture i like the fact that they supply their ingredients locally too .
chicken was over cooked there wasnt much flavor and service wasnt the greatest we had ceviche chicken with rice and beans huevos rancheros and maduros there are a lot of other cuban restaurants that are much better including cafecito .
absolutely love the kale salad here refreshing and tangy the serving is huge though which makes it perfect to share and leave room to try other dishes .
my we had valentines dinner special o boy was it special i got sick throwup the seafood meal i ate when there is no grade sign in the front of the restaurtant be careful last time i go there to eat .
i absolutely love this place the food is fantastic the atmosphere is perfect if i had a girlfriend i would take her here .
appetizers are junk seafood isnt fresh but at least the steak dishes are pretty rad and and the live music is fun .
doesnt take reservations first come first serve whatever you do please come hungry believe the reviews its not hype its glory be prepared to eat till youre in submission youve been warned .
i have had better pizza was soggy in the center staff great decorations are very nice .
one of my alltime favs a wonderful restaurant chris is the best host ever and i always leave happy cant wait for next sunday brunch .
pizza was burned and stale and tasteless to top it all of the staff was rude def not going back do yourself a favor and get some good pizza next door at grimaldis this place is so not what it makes itself out to be .
this place is great went here for a date night and truly enjoyed the cozy atmosphere quality food and a bottle of wine standouts are the kale salad and the meatballs delicious cant wait to return for brunch .
ordered takeout and still waited when i arrived even though they said it would be ready very annoying .
friendly staff fantastic food great concept love love love .
so weird and out of touch nothing special in this city of special pizza places and the worst service in all of new york .
this place will never let you down in any way ever go there .
the high ratings that wasabi garners are inscrutable to me as are its absurdly high zagat ratings notsofresh sushi and lowquality indifferentlyprepared chicken teriyaki make this a mustmiss in the new haven area .
interesting menu chill environment fresh ingredient and friendly staff we had to wait because the place is very tuny for two but i was very happy with my meal once we got down to business .
not sure what this place is bar italian pizza formal casual no clue i dont like it i live right near it and ive been twice cant get excited about this one lesson 1 dont turn a formal catering hall into a pizza shop .
such a great out of the way restaurant in the east village it has an inviting and warm vibe that is buzzing with obvious return customers i went there for sunday brunch had the ricotta omelet amazing tip get there early there will be a wait .
food takes forever tastes good but overpriced .
adorable great for brunch and dinner healthy creative food mostly local great specials cute and beachy a nice crowd popular so expect a short wait .
fyi closed for renovations till 01192015 hope the improve the food too last time we just stopped in for 2 naan ive never seen anything like it worst naan ever not homemade mustve been frozen in reheated .
this is reminiscent of a california country style eatery i went for brunch and loved my eggs with their cured beef fantastic coffee thumbs up just get there early for brunch .
due to lack of english speaking people i was given too much food and paid dearly for it food is good but overly priced and without proper people to speak to over the phone i was ripped off .
this place is wonderful gets busy during brunch but worth waiting get the biscuits and jelly theyre proper southernstyle biscuits .
no good curry here place smelled but not like good food food was so greasy .
amazingly delicious very chill atmosphere the gnocchi was the best thing ive ever eaten in my life oh my gd i wanna go back and eat more the decal of the place is awesome country cottage meets hip east village restaurant loved it all .
i dont like or will not eat at a place that does not give free refills i ate here once got charged for a refill have not been back .
this place is amazing what an experience great food great staff great wine so cozy and the meatballs are killer .
tried the pad thai here for the first time and was very disappointed the pad thai lacked sauce and flavor wouldnt try this place again .
i followed my fellow yelpers reviews im glad i did a cute but small space with a modest but interesting menu i chose the chicken egg sandwich and it was delicious i will be back .
1 star actually tea still watered down and the service is still bad only thing they do right is the curry puffs but i can live with out them .
fresh food prepared simply in a comfortable environment i found the concept more compelling than the overall experiencethe food was probably closer to 3 or 3 5 stars but im rounding up because im a sucker for the localsustainable thing .
how do you screw up shrimp phad thai trust me this place does way too sweet other dish crispy fish with basil again way too sweet and fish not crispy after swimming in sugar sauce this is not good thai food .
delicious nonpretencious cute decor very friendly staff some dishes like squid risotto and deserts are outstanding new favourite place .
wow no words the response alone makes me feel better about the choice not to go back .
unreal romantic and delicious little gem in the middle of the village definitely try the kale salad and pork meatballs .
i felt bad after reading the owners comment i thought maybe i wrote a review for the wrong place my review is for the correct place shame on you for denying it i went onto your website and i even found the server who helped me .
great little place food is fresh and very affordable .
good food poor service dont order delivery takes forever and the food comes luke warm and soggy .
great food i like the brunch better than dinner but its all good and the vibe inside is very nice too they added new tables in the back that are very romantic but you feel like youre isolated .
ordered signature fried chicken melt went upstairs and realizes they skipped on the coleslaw super dry and greasy meal for 13 will look elsewhere .
kale salad .
forgiveness is something earned not just given with that said in 4 trips here this is the second time in a row they dont have chicken or bacon so you mean to tell me half your menu is irrelevant foh im done with this hole in a wall .
possibly my new favorite restaurant giraffe friendly enough and real fresh real delicious food go for breakfast and get the hash you will be happy .
it was good until i found a thick short black hair in my food i shudder to think if it was facial or pubic .
have only been to brunch twice ive had the polenta with eggs and the sweet potato and bread salad with poached eggs both are extremely good i would highly suggest getting the griddled cornbread with sweet onion yogurt spread to die for .
totally disorganized never got to try the food since after 20 minutes of waiting with people behind me served i had to get back to my office i did get to watch the prep which was not impressive .
great brunch place having lived in sf had high hopes for this one and lived up to the expectations food is fresh and well prepared egg dish was tasty and homemade sausage paties were favorite part .
fried chicken does not apparently belong on thin pieces of sourdough not a fan .
i went for brunch with some girlfriends and i must say that the brunch menu is phenomenal licked my plate clean which is something i rarely ever do coffee was awesome the only downside was the wait for the table .
worst service ever not only is the shop disorganized but if you order delivery it might not show up i will never order from this restaurant again .
try the quince seltzer .
this place is josie grossie i can make a better grilled cheese and the smell inside nauseating .
fantastic comfortable and welcomed addition to the neighborhood wgreat food drink and market double love .
got the three cheese melt but that wasnt even enough cheese for me duh what an overpriced unhealthy and hip sandwich shop i would rather get prets grilled cheese next time .
great adventurous food in a mellow country setting smaller space but no overcrowded try the kale salad with squash to share .
this is a review of the black white milkshake it was bad vanilla ice cream with bitter chocolate sauce drizzled in the cup it was not smooth tons of ice shards it was too thick the straw did not work how can a milkshake go wrong yuck .
great place to grab a good hotdog they have everything you can possibly want to put on a hot dog i would recommend this place to anyone that likes good hotdogs and a friendly environment .
really sub par the waitress with the bangs was straight up rude and the food was pretentious antiquated and dumb .
check out this magazines rating of my favorite hot dog place big daddys they beat out the so called name brands in passaic county the best hot dogs hands down period everything is fresh and you cant beat the price one of new jersey best .
i went to barbuzzo with my family during restaurant week and it was terrible i dont know if it was just the restaurant week menu but the food was disgusting also our server was not friendly at all .
they have the best hot dogs so many specialty dogs to choose from love it and will always come back here .
cant believe i drove from ny to try this place what a waste place was nice but thats about it food was not good wouldnt recommend this place .
this place is phenomenal if you want a hot dog dont go anywhere else but here so many styles stewarts root beer on tap about 100 hot sauces on display ready to sample and put on your dog 5 stars easily .
the food was satisfactory but the noise level and lack of space made this a less than desirable experience also our particular server was rather abrupt and not very helpful .
great spot in a sleepy little town amazing entertainment and the food while not a broad selection is quite delicious would love to see more craft beer here .
food was fine while paying my tab i noticed that they rounded up in their favor my change i was blown away when the server told me we dont do coins wtf .
great place to get drinks awesome old building with outdoor seating super friendly staff and cheap drinks .
would have been 5 but found a pubic hair in my dish which is unacceptable and disgusting otherwise the food was amazing and perfectly portioned .
absolutly awesome the mineiro for me was the best the people are very hospitable it looks like a typical pizza joint however its like a little piece of brazil awesome taste for an awesome price i only wish they were in queens i would be a regular .
the food was ehh it didnt help that our table outside was on an uneven surface and there wasnt enough room on the table for two meals water and an appetizer i probably wouldnt return wasnt anything too special .
you must come here if your in the area im a pizza junkie and this is hands down the best pizza i have ever had not only that the people here are extremely friendly dont forget to get some break knots .
i dont have the energy to give details but i can no longer support this place based on lack of consistency .
got two pies for carry out 1 new york style the other sicilian the sicilian was loaded with veggies and was of the best pizzas ive had in my 22 years in vermont .
the food was bland and boring overpriced and too simple for a restaurant and i got the worst food poisoning .
great food great service clean and friendly a in my book .
visited for dinner last week for the first time spent the rest of the night on the toilet before that happened thought my meal was overpriced tasteless crap i hear from others they are better for brunch but honestly i would never go back ever .
good pizza conveniently located in williston good prices it is definitely new york style pizza id definitely order from ramuntos again next time through vermont .
do not go here terrible service bad bad customer relations we came here to eat at 301pm they said the kitchen closed at 3pm are you kidding who own this joint hire people who know how to treat your customers ill go take my money elsewhere thanks .
i love the spicy buffalo pizza but the sausage and just plain cheese pizzas are really good too .
not a fan service was rude tragicallyhip waiter couldnt give a shit 7 2 oz portion of brussel sprouts 7 side of fries really no thanks ill walk down thw street .
best pizza in town i would say for williston and surrounding area from what ive tasted it isnt cheap but id say it is priced appropriately as you get petty awesome taste for it nice thin crunchy crust flavorful toppings and pretty quick service .
idiots refused to serve us at 3 pm because they were prepping for dinner wait staff ignored us and was rude i travelled to sample their menu and will probably never return i only gave two stars because the menu was interesting .
great little place can get a fresh and healthy lunch for around 6 dollars i got their veggie greek wrap very delicious will be eating here again before i leave town .
decent brunch no espresso machine .
quick friendly divey delicious cheap i asked for fries on the side of my cheesesteak at which point it was suggested to me that the fries go on the cheesesteak fantastic suggestion amazing sandwich ill be back here every time im in newark which is often .
i have now been there twice it has sub standard pizza at best they over due the topping and have the worst crust in new haven it wasnt even edible i say go there if you like a carbon crust and sweaty people making your pizza .
incredible experience gm mike was great as well as his staff very accommodating and helpful food was excellent every dish was fantastic wine was good i had an awesome birthday dinner there the beet salad was so good .
they have very strict groupon policy which i dont understand the restaurant was more than half empty but owner gave us hard time to redeem groupon because we did not make a reservation with groupon wont back again .
however be prepared for a 2 5 to 3 hour dinner and very small portions the food is actually 5 star quality and great for date night and girls night out but not for real men looking to eat i ate after dinner just to be satisfied .
i placed an order for delivery and it took 2 hours for me to receive my food the sushi had a bad smell and i didnt eat it for fear that i would get sick i will not order from them in the future .
yes to wile boar pasta wasnt a fan of a pasta coin with braised goat the rabbit dish is out of this world the funnel breadstraws are are yummy .
service was really good fast and attentive sushi was just ok though the temple roll was really unique vegetable gyoza were kinda mushy and undercooked .
it doesnt get any better than this pricey but you know that going in the food and the service excelled our party of 4 gave 5 stars to everything we ordered .
neither food nor service nor beer selection is worth four stars this is a fine dive but do not call this a four star irish pub .
no complaints food ambiance wine staff and attention to detail were superb 10 nutella stuffed donuts instead of 5 would be the only thing my boyfriend and i would change sommelier jordan extremely helpful and approachable waitstaff matt and sarah personable knowledgeable and flawless buonissimo .
sort of over this place 2 50 for a mozzarella stick and watered down beer it can be cozy in the winter but thats about the only lure the waitress was rude and bartenders are not engaging or overly friendly .
excellent food excellent service great atmosphere upstairs not for the diner folk this is a true eating experience spend the its worth it and try a bunch of different stuff for special occasions .
terrible are people serious best burger ever haha this is an extremely mediocre bar burger and the fries are the same i guess no one has been to any bar in america dry bland burger and fries .
great food in a lively setting handmade pastas are as good as any in the city rabbit was tender and tasty excellent wine list .
woman who waited on us was very rude i never felt welcomed would not go back .
i was here for a pork tasting and everything was great we did a wine pairing which was perfect i will be back for sure to try the regular menu strongly recommend .
burgers are humongous dry and tasteless i had way better burgers try the new york burgers co .
outstanding simply outstanding four of us went on sunday night wont waste my time but best italian food i ever had .
i came to try the burger and found it was majorly overrated its like they chopped up half a cow and put it between a bun waaay to thick for my liking i didnt even make it through half .
absolutely exceptional italian food highly recommend it tasted a range of pastas and appetizers all were fantastic .
this review is just based on 2 dishes i ordered for take out corned beef and cabbage dry and cabbage not flavorful couldve made it better w grocery store bought corned beef in my kitchen chicken pot pie not good .
their beet salad is fantastic perhaps the best ive had also the sorbets are to die for very elegant restaurant for a nice night out .
the food was fine not awful i didnt really like the decorations drinks werent very good .
great for pasta lovers beautifull place and good service like it small pasta primi plates but you can go with 23 of those just perfect flavours mix .
terrible customer service we were greeted and told to grab any table without giving us any menus 15 minutes later we hadnt even seen a waiter or a bartender to help us obviously we left and would never even consider coming back here what a waste of time .
their portion size is perfect for pasta the fusilli is amazing for dessert the chocolate bomboloni is so ridiculously good try this place .
food took over an hour to come out and it was both cold and bad very disappointing .
the lobster pasta was absolutely fantastic my fiance and i had a wonderful experience great atmosphere the ricotta app was to die for .
food is okay but not worth the wait and the money it takes more than 30min for the kitchen to bring the food to the table and all the items on the menu are overpriced .
pappardelle with boar is sweet as was the baked ricotta .
the bone marrow and short rib burger was very disappointing the bun was very dry and stale they claim ot have a top burger and it fell far from impressing .
great meal excellent food really nothing we ordered was less than amazing wonderful wine list with a sommelier that really knew his wines definitely recommend to others while the meal wont come cheap its totally worth it .
cash only unless u r a 100 yr old steakhouse in brooklyn not acceptable in 2014 great way to lose business .
pasta is awesome here as are the interesting cocktails ive had above average meals here on each occasion and ill definitely make it back sometime soon everything is good that ive had thus far .
very mediocre chinese food definitely not hawaiian in anyway except for how they title the menu friday night had some interesting karaoke performances overall fun when you go with a great group .
wonderful experience from the moment we walked in and were greeted warmly waitstaff were friendly and professional drinks were interesting but a bit pricey food was perfectly prepared good place for special occasion not loud you can sit and talk and enjoy your dining experience .
went in for ablate lunch with my boyfriend sunday afternoon only ones in the place everything was great we were talking and eating and then suddenly felt rushed we will go back great place .
i like this a lot great food good help with the entirely italian but quite the selection wine a little pricier than some alternative eats in the neighborhood note to self think 250 for two allin but rather worth it nice enough to be special .
this is not hawaiian food this is strip mall chinese food with tacky but fun hawaiian décor the food is worse than your local chinese take out there are polynesian choices but nothing authentic spend your money on the drinks .
excellent .
horrible food and even worse customer service .
great salads amazing pastas tremendous entrees 3 for 3 plus a shutout to kevin the bartender .
wasnt bad but wasnt great i know good spanish food and this def didnt impress me the owners other restaurant bayou is delicious diff cuisine creolenew orleans style but way better .
choosing italian in rittenhouse square this is the place hands down this is a stephen starr offering that excites and inspires an exceptional addition to the restaurant scene in the neighborhood .
excellent sandwiches cool people it is not cool to charge 1 for air and leave a biker without air because youre almost out of quarters if you didnt have them that would make sense .
service atmosphere excellent food delicious but found the portions very small for the price .
prices are totally insane save your money unless you care to pay 3 75 for a lousy hot dog .
this place is on the verge great food eclectic choices fantastic bar with natalie at your service .
terrible service called up to place an order and did not receive part of my meal was over charged and was given an attitude also was not given a refund for the food i did not order will never go back .
randomly stopped by here for a drink and dinner with a colleague was randomly and pleasantly surprised cool atmosphere and really good food amazing fries and my chicken sandwich was really impressive would def go back love music with a piano which was a nice touch .
place is garbage sauce is sweet and tastes burnt and you can actually taste the cologne in the pizza that the pizza cook was wearing dont waste your money on this joint .
best burger weve ever had pickle plate was okay fries amaze and eggplant salad ridiculous cant wait to go back .
not on par with most of nj pizza fancy place but the pizza is bland and im pretty sure the staff is the cast of the jersey shore town politics are the only thing keeping this place in business also ridiculous pricing for a pizzeria .
best grilled cheese ever but be sure to add the bacon oh and this place is not loud .
just picked up a dozen bagels not my first visit but will probably be my last its only 1130am and the bagels are stale not the chewy goodness they should be time to find a new bagel shop .
great food great service and a nice dining experience our server was michael j and he was wonderful .
food was terrible rolled up lunch meat is not my idea of an antipasto id pay for at least make it look nice ugh dry bread too it was just really awful all around .
incredible the piano bar is amazing she has the most incredible voice and knows all the classics food is great i had the best grilled cheese sandwich and tomato soup that i have ever put in my mouth cant wait to see what happens here tomorrow .
my reason for a one star rating is that there is only one vegan item and only four our of 14 vegetarian items on this menu i would definitely be more inclined to go if there were more of these offerings be creative thank you .
great sliders great salmon great burgers great food drinks are fantastic and ambiance is great .
was excited to try place was packed only one server didnt get waited in for 20 mins so i left will try again another time when more servers on because food looked great .
clearly a nice discovery the duck confit is fantastic the pork belly slider was so good it should become an entrée the black bean burger is very good even cocktails and desserts are excellent definitively a must try .
not terrible but very overrated we only had chicken things which might explain the mediocrity the mole tastes like soy sauce there are several tvs playing daytime mexican gameshows solid horchata and salsa .
excellent drinks well priced drinks and dinner burgers should not have thick brioche buns but good tasty bar food with a touch of class will go back if im in the area .
i thought it was pretty sweet until i discovered a few random little chicken pieces in my vegetarian dish huge no no .
great place for a casual dinner in philadelphia very nicely and tastefully decorated we had their duck and the cheeseburger both were excellent their house cabernet was great especially for the price also a great list of beers we will definitely go back .
the food was okay nothing special but the waitress was really rude im not going back .
late dinner here this evening with friends wonderful tasty food and uber friendly wait staff looking forward to my next visit to taste the menu more pickled veggie plate and my burger were top notch .
not impressed as a vegan the only thing i felt safe ordering was a steamed vegetable dish which was just that steamed veggies i could have made it home it was overpriced nobody else in the party was that impressed either .
chef mackenzie doing an awesome job revamping this fun tasteful and tasty menu fun place fun food happy chef gayborhood is alive an well .
their pizza is good everything else is meh ordered a filet mignon one day and they served me a sloppy skirt steak instead will not be returning .
the prices are a bit higher than an average dinner we visited but you get plenty of food and service is fast and friendly .
i actually really enjoyed the food at this restaurant however the staff were horribly rude i would not go back there again .
not sure why this place has such poor reviews ive eaten here twice both for breakfast and ive been happy with my meal both times eggs benedict and french fries were yummy pancakes fluffy and moist bacon crisp typical diner food what do yall expect .
food is run of the mill and mediocre at best general tsos chicken that was advertised as the best in the menu was overpowered with vinegar what really stands out is how impolite they are with customers never returning or recommending .
this is a very typical jersey diner the food and service are decent no complaints you get very large portions are very affordable prices the only problem is getting on and off route 1 into the parking lot especially if youre on the wrong side of route 1 .
the only thing this place has is a beer w your burger better burgers w five guys bobby flays etc i will say summer is cute and fun .
came with friends at the start of our nyc trip good selection generous portions and very good food friendly staff an enormous dessert counter which we did sample from our son had a chocolate mouse and thoroughly enjoyed it will definitely stop here again when in the area .
wannabe shake shack style burger with five guys fries not very good food combined with slow and unfriendly service go to shake shack rather than waste your time on this lackluster knock off .
two words perfect scrapple i normally have more to say but that really says it all .
awful awful a complete waste of money .
everything on the menu is delicious the staff are nice and accommodating space is small .
sorry guys but this place was not what i expected the cost was very high and the seasonings were very bland i found the sauce to be acidic and had heartburn from it i wont be ordering another time .
i gotta say the scramble eggs i had was pretty decent so did the blueberry pancakes shame i got there late otherwise i bet it would be awesome when its hot i love the potatoes particularly they are amazing its quite pricy but totally worth it .
pennington location mediocre pizza corking fee for wine we brought and entirely too bright dining room besides the excellent service we came away unimpressed .
i just cant do french toast really well it is sweet here like any other place the egg benedict was good the staff is friendly but this place is cash only .
waste of time and expensive terrible seating and service .
it was just so delicious locals may say its not worth the wait but if you are coming to visit nyc this is a must stop .
they always take my order wrong and they add extra stuff in my order out of my order and charge me extra .
amazing brunch and big portion too waited for r0 minutes but so worth it and there is a morrocan cafe right in front so waiting was no problem at all .
overrated food is okay but over priced should be rated wait staff is indifferent to the presence of customers they could really use some warmth training been here about 4 times because i wanted to like this place .
i was skeptical about their pancakes but after tasting them they were so good the butter maple was an awesome paring to the pancakes .
typical ct burger place they just cant get a burger done medium and so packed on fridays and sat its like people never seen food before long lines fool you small burger thick bun stuffed belly .
cash only great spot for breakfast arrived right at 8am and got right in got the blueberry pancakes with a side of bacon yummy coffee is good too .
terrible experience regular cheese burger was overcooked and not edible fries were stale wasnt just my burger but my husbands as well the cheese was melted hard to the top of the bun and not melted over the burger very disappointing .
good lord my salmon eggs benedict way exceeded my expectations seriously the best ive ever had they use a biscuit instead of an english muffin and it is amaze i will be dreaming about this breakfast when i return back to la .
decent burger decent bourbon and beer selection but the lack of in house made sides onion rings fries etc really drag down the whole place from being great to be competitive going forward they should invest and make things in house people will notice .
the place is really small and tight but the milk shakes were awesome the pancakes were great felt the need to rush tho because of the people who are watching yoo thru the window other than that i loved it .
while the food always tastes great here and im pleased with the service the lack of lobster on my new englander burger was annoying .
amazing just wait .
epic fail terrible food decent service if youre interested on how plan b should have pulled this off drive yourself over to prime 16 in new haven you can thank me later the locals love this place its quite entertaining .
breakfast for dinner blueberry pancakes were the best ive ever had i also tried the omelette and crab cakes crab cakes were ok not my cup of tea omelette was so soft and creamy i loved it the place is fantastic id totally come back .
not worth the wait for a table then once seated slow service for a hamburger and fries .
omg i had huevos rancheros it had chorizo jalepeno sour cream salsa and a great tortilla amazing i ate it so fast out of love it tasted delish one of the things i really recommend this place and his meal i think i died but in happiness .
im done with plan b twice weve had issues 1 the most disgusting caked up spoons youve ever seen were served with our chili 2 my friend had plastic in her burger both situations were handled very poorly .
the food was delicious i have nothing bad to say about this place besides the wait is so long but worth it wait .
overwhelmingly mediocre the burgers were bland and unimpressive the restaurant itself looks great and the beerburbon selection is nice but if the food isnt good who cares dont waste your time on this place five guys is just down the street .
the pancakes are pretty good but dont all come running at once and making the wait outside the restaurant for breakfast 3 hours long on a weekday morning .
come only for drinks food has gone down hill manager moses served us cold fries a dirty wine glass with ranch dressing on the glass will never come to this establishment again .
so darn goooooooooooooooooooooooooooodddddddddd ­ .
my experience here was blah the service really sucked the menu didnt list anything that really jumped out at me so to speak the 4 of us felt the same way nothing spectacular and i had high expectations after hearing so many great things .
best pancakes ive ever had in my life i went with blueberry service was good and we didnt feel rushed go on a weekday cash only .
i have tasted better food this place is overpriced small and my coworkers and i do not recommend theres so much better eatery in newark .
my favorite meal of the day is always breakfast and they always satisfy my needs pause one of these days i will attend pancake month .
maybe i should try their other food items but i find the tacos to be extremely overrated i have been here a few times and ive been disappointed every single time .
we waited one hour and the staff were really professional and helpful got yogurt with granola and fruit and shared a stack of blueberry pancakes with my friend i was full for the rest of the day worth the wait .
just having moved from hoboken nj were looking for a new local pizza joint this is not it you know pizza is bad when you dont finish it and end up throwing it away still looking .
perfect .
moes meh .
great sandwiches and paninis at clinton the service is fast and friendly i keep going back for the very tasty coffee better than most anywhere around this hood .
every time i eat at this place i run to the bathroom i will not return to this place now that chipotle is open .
awesome pancakes i loved the fruit preserves they served with the muffins the bellini was ok not the best ive had overall great place for breakfast .
4 days of running to the bathroom in panic enough said avoid this place .
sometimes when im sad i think about their banana pancakes to cheer me up works every time .
their queso is disgusting i took it home and it was pure white no peppers onion or flavor so bland tasted like it was made with synthetic plastic wrapped cheese .
i reached there at 200 pm waiting for 15minutes because i just need one seat very very good food .
very average there are much better places to go if you want anything they offer if you take a glance at the nutrition information youll realize that nearly every meal they offer has about 1500 calories .
my friend recommended this place fried chicken and waffles were delicious and it was a big portion the staff was friendly and helpful will definitely be returning .
j .
crazy wait over an hour even on a weekday its expensive for brunch but delicious i had the banana pancake enough of 1 order to share its a must try try the mojitos but do not try their baking goods from the counter they are expensive and dry .
place sucks servers are slow basic burgers with a do it yourself check off menu not a good experience .
delicious brunch place in nyc had egg benedict and banana walnuy pancake both were awesome would def go again .
i got clear raw chicken here they didnt ask to replace it just took it off the check very expensive for no reason could be good but they dont have it together .
split the pancakes with a companion and try something else the pancakes are perfect but just too damn heavy in the end .
very high price for just one burger litle fried not happy bad quality bad customer service no price on menu this one rip of no good .
pancakes were incredible and the food is so good it ends up being a conversation piece quick service just delicious rosemary sausages were o kay but i dont care 5 stars on that maple butter alone .
soooo slow 1 hour for a chicken sandwich grrrr great aesthetics and food is not so bad lunch for two two sandwiches two fries and a two waters cost 40 eh smash burger is 1 minute up the road might skip the counter next time .
awesome pancakes and absolutely loved their short ribs so tender and juicy and it was yummy great ambiance and vibe to this place ps we came here for dinner so no wait lol .
the creativity to create just about any burger you desire is awesome but overall the burger could of been a bit more seasoned definitely wasnt the best ive had .
the pancake is lovely they serve the beakfast menu even in dinner time blueberry pencake is great ans milk shake as well .
the counter burger is good but not worth 12 dollars lil pricey esp when u get the same or better burger elsewhere in clifton area the wait time was like 30 mins the interior is nice though .
the food here is exceptional i went for the buttermilk biscuit breakfast sandwich while my wife went for the blueberry pancakes both were excellent and i would recommend to all expect a wait and make sure you have cash as they dont accept cards .
go to zinburger bar stools short and took 15 minutes to get a drink they are new but come on my food was there 2 seconds after my drink .
i went here for dinner the other night and got chicken and waffles it was incredible this place serves everything fresh roasted kale on the side was amazing too we loved what we had great for dinner too .
awful terrible service the host lied to us while he was seating other people pretentious never going again .
always busy but worth it for the pancakes small space that works well for groups of 24 blueberry pancakes are the best ive ever had and the service is always terrifc havent tried anything but the pancakes but it is known for that so stick with that option .
you probably lose so much more money being cash only therefore turning off potential customers than you would lose on just sucking it up and getting a credit card machine .
the hour wait is so worth it this is my second time here and between the banana walnut pancakes and the southern breakfast i fell in love even the orange juice which is made inhouse is amazing .
sandwich was just okay jimmy johns is a lot better and friendly try hiring some help you cheapskate nicco orders take forever and his attitude sucks with so many options for italian deli and sandwiches i wont be back .
try their eggs benedict you will not be sorry .
went in on a saturday and ordered a cheesesteak no other customers in the place it took almost 25 minutes for him to make something other places can bring out in 5 minutes and it turned out to be among the very worst cheesesteaks i have ever had .
the pancakes shakes and bacons are heavenly love the place so much i bought the cookbook cash only is a bit of a pain and theres always a line but worth it .
ill be brief bleeeeeeeeeeehhhhhhhhhhhhhhh .
i wanted to be mad 40 minutes waiting in the cold 25 minutes after we were seated before our order was taken but wow the food was redemption itself .
had a pepperoni pizza and order of garlic knots didnt like the pizza sauce pizza was forgettable and the worst were the garlic knots we deff got an old batch or something dry and hard plenty of pizzerias in the area prefer juniors so far in the area .
you have to wait at lease 1030 mins to get in one of the best menu of st clinton baking is pancake with choice of topping serve with maple butter syrup this is must .
not really impressed food was ok prices were slightly high and not the prettiest place in the world .
best food in les though the wait is horrible removed one star for long wait .
terrible bar the bartender lee is a jack along with the other one i patiently waited for a very long time food is way below par do not waste your money avoid this place at all costs go up the street to ringside pub .
although the wait is long it is worth it we had brunch here omelette and blueberry pie the serving was big and everything on the plate was just delicious i would definitely add it to my list of togo places for brunch .
one of their bartenders stole my cell phone while i was there only found out a week later through a friend of a friend who worked there pretty bad service if you ask me .
the southern breakfast with eggs cheese grits fried green tomatoes and sugar cured bacon was spectacular we waited an hour and were glad we did .
my order is always simple yet they are able to mess it up time after time pizza always looks so old and dry i wouldnt eat here again .
myself and my boyfriend went to clinton st bakery company for our valentines day brunch we had an amazing brunch i would highly recommend you trying clinton st bakery company if you havent it is that good .
pizza is soso but like everyone else says the service is horrible so slow and im only ordering one pie takes 15 min to make but takes 20 min to take an order smh .
absolutely loved the pancakes banana friend chicken was so delicious had kale corn bread so good i will go back for more and to try other things on the menu .
it took them 45 minutes to make a grilled cheese and the cheese was not even melted you couldnt pay me to go back to this place its horrible .
worth the wait expect 23 hours when its busy most of the time pancakes are amazing get them super fluffy .
order a italian sub there was 4 slices of ham 3 slices of salami and 4 slices of cheese i paid 10 70 for that and a arizona iced tea what a huge ripoff ill never go back .
no bad but definitely not worth the crazy lines the food was all quite good but too sweet for my taste .
bagels are okay pizza is okay nothing special employees are very rude especially for a new business with such competition i was very disappointed .
download the nowait app to save yourself the excruciating long wait .
mediocre bagels cold coffee at 730am tried every carafe and they were all stone cold completely unacceptable wont be going back we pass by here all the time and its always empty theyll never last .
great place the french toast and the pancakes are to die for definitely worth the visit for anyone visiting manhattan .
food came out cool appetizer soup and entree had to send it back each time they were out of entrees at 7pm on a friday very very disappointed this is basic stuff how can they not get this right .
best brunch ive ever had best pancakes omg long long long wait bu mouthwatering food .
slow slow slow service our waitress was waiting on our table and a large party seems par for the course at this place food is average portion sizes very good prices are fair prices are fair parking is terrible .
amazing food i ordered huevos ransheros normally you get unlucky in nyc ordering something like that but it was delicious then the blueberry pancakes was a great finale for the experience this place is a 5 star .
painfully slow and just horrendous service food is good prices are fair owner is very nice but what a bad experience stop in for a drink at the bar but dont try it for dinner .
waited for 130 hours but it was definitely worth it you can wait in one of the cafes around there the pancakes were amazing possibly the best ones i had in my life i surely want to go there again .
definitely below the quality of other bonefish i have eaten in service was mediocre they didnt even clear the appetizer and salad plates before bringing the salad plates no one checked if we were happy with our meals the entrees were mediocre at best evidently very poor management .
expect a wait .
disappointing greasy fish spicy food poorly prepared margarita slow service wont return .
chicken and waffles fk yeah given its a pretty bougiemiddlebrow rendition of the dish it was still delicious any complaints i have with it are just minor nit picking items we got seated right away which is apparently impossible at this place and service was great .
most of the food isnt cooked fresh over seasoned or just plain nasty the iced teauptown is disgusting and the management sucks its ran by a bunch of drunk haitain jehovah witnesses and the waitresses are all hoodrats its on main st in east orange for a reason .
so delicious thankfully only waited 10 minutes and got seats by the window i can imagine not liking it as much if we were jammed in somewhere seating is very tight .
unfriendly service mediocre food the manager tried to overcharge my party of 8 stay away .
we had the country breakfast and the waffles both of which were excellent the wait can be long so come early we arrived at 10am and waited about 40minutes they dont accept credit cards .
salad was good but the portion was pathetic sandwich was good but i couldnt take more than 3 bites of that veggie chili .
the food was great especially their signature fries and the mussels the ambience was also lovely .
what can i say i had high expectations from this place but unfortunately the taste was very disappointing the margherita pizza we ordered was not all upto the mark especially in area where there are excellent italian restaurants better off eating at the lyndhurst diner .
outstanding the place is small so be prepared to wait about 30 min but it is well worth it i had the southern breakfast and it was incredible the whole family loved it next time in nyc this is a must stop .
went to bills to visit after several years hiatus the management has changed and the vibe was horrible i now understand why there were very few people in the place would not recommend this place at all i would suggest you would be more comfortable somewhereanywhere else .
wonderful food service with cozy ambiance great to go for professional and casual meet and greets with friends also super cute for a romantic brunch date .
its like being served bad tv dinners from a server that just got fired from walmart dont try to substitue something on their menu or the waitress will read you the riot act horrible .
the blueberry pancakes were delicious worth the hype .
food and service here are really bad please do not go to this restaurant they are just making some shit .
dont be afraid of the lines your stomach will thank you after its finished making a ton of noise because you havent fed it for hours no reservations no fuss just straight pancakes and deliciousness if you want a tip go during dinner hours its a little quieter .
they do not accept the 10 off deal as advertised food is decent though .
banana walnut pancakes are to die for chicken apple sausage whoop whoop slap a mimosa on my table please thank you just wish the service was a bit faster and bacon a bit crispier .
wish i could give them zero star i live nearby and treated horribly every time an old waitress gives me attitude every time im there they ignored my orders once too .
excellent food outstanding service definately worth the wait .
omg this place is getting worse and worse first of all they rise the price and portion even got less second whatever noodles i order they do not have and the sign says noodles village third i will seriously think twice to go back .
blueberry pancakes were absolutely amazing fluffy and just melted in my mouth there were blueberries on top and inside the pancakes the wait was only 20 minutes on a wednesday .
very little portion .
unbelievable french toast and the blueberry pancake was phenomenal the only thing that sucked about this place was the 2 5 hrs wait especially when you are starving thank god for a kind bar to hold me off will go again real soon .
the beef chow fun was dry overcooked and strangely had eggs the clams with garlic was unbelievably salty the veggie dish was a tiny portion all in all not particularly good .
long wait but we loved our pancakes so light and fluffy you cant go wrong with any flavor .
taste was actually pretty good however our family ended up to be extremely thirsty after no msg what a lie i probably wont go back cuz i really can not stand on the unusual thirstiness .
we had the blueberry pancakes and the breakfast sandwich looovvveed the pancakes it was slightly crispy and oh so good maple butter the sandwich was good hash browns were okay cash only we arrived at 9am and waited 15 mins .
not so sure what the hype is all about the food is ehh i really didnt like anything other than the chicken we ordered the boneless spare ribs and terrible the delivery time is about an hour so if you are in a rush dont call over there .
the food is good the environment is friendly and everything is super yummy went for the pancake special and was very happy .
came in asked for a chinese menu ordered 3 pepper chicken what they brought was a little spicy suuuuuuuuper sweet sautéed chicken all i could taste was sugar this is 2013 and people even nonchinese want to eat what they ordered authentic food .
favorite brunch place of all times i take my friend here and no one ever disappoints except the fact that you have to wait so long fluffy pancake is just the best you will get addicted to it .
terrible place to eat the food was the worst chinese food i ever had i ordered the general tso chicken and hot and sour soup i would not eat there ever again and wouldnt reccomend this place to anyone .
oh yeah banana nut french toast still as good see picture yum .
if you like cockroaches crawling on you while you eat then this is the place is for you .
best breakfast i have ever had the wait is worth it ranks best in service creativity and environment .
my .
ill take clinton st bakerys blueberry pancakes over an amazing orgasm any day thats how incredibly good those fckers are .
absolutely not worth the money the food barely has flavor and the owner looks miserable you are better off paying the price for excellent pizza places such as zavino or pietros .
awesome food excellent service tiny and intimate place on les definitely will go back chicken and waffle is amazing .
i dunno the pizza is good but nothing special its alos the most expensive pizza place in philly i highly recommend gusto a few blocks away much less and just as tasty no even better .
very good reliable establishment and deserves 4 stars based on its food however with the wait and how touristy this place is now this place isnt worth it for me anymore .
the pizza is okay but the staff has zero class i wont return i feel much better about taking my business and wine to gusto pizzaria just around the corner where for years the staff has been pleasant and the pizza is so much better .
amazing food as always just the wait and early closing hours can get a bit annoying at times .
this place is quite close to me so i really want to love it but the truth is its just ok not terrible but certainly not great ill go back because its close but i wouldnt make the trek here if its not convenient .
light fluffy not dense delicious blueberry pancakes came in here at 8pm on a thursday for them no line just a couple tables it was delicious and great lots of people had shakes and hamburgers gotta come back for that .
the food neither tasty nor fresh i felt sick after eating the sushi rolls never come back again .
cant believe this place only has 7 reviews this is the best brunch spot in nyc came here new years eve and already been back twice the blueberry pancakes are to die for i wish they took reservations but it really is worth the wait highly recommend .
i really dont understand how this place gets 4 5 stars the food is barely mediocre and the service is nonexistent do yourself a favor and pick a different place .
wonderful place to have brunch but seats are very limited go early french toast is the best .
only enjoyed the chips and guacamole .
fantastic food and service got lucky with the no wait however the experience is worth it .
eh for whatever reason i like the teaneck location much betteralso the food and its quality varies greatly from t different cooks i guessbut i really like consistency .
excellent food try the pancakes theyre really worthwhile wait is a little long for brunch so make sure you go in early and find something to do in the meantime .
below par poor excuse for italian food tried take out very rude cant justify in my mind to try it again save your money .
i came at the right time because as soon as i did it got packed i ordered the biscuit sandwich it was delicious such a simple meal amazing flavors great staff cook spot enjoy .
kind of a disappointment food wasnt that great and the portions were small i had just come back from spain so perhaps i had too high expectations place is tiny though too and felt cramped .
i dont know why people love this place between the hype of the characteristic long wait the food was good but not great here is the most important part if you cross houston street you will find cornerstone cafe which certainly has better pancakes french toast and prices .
jamonera has average food coupled with great drinks id gladly come back for happy hour but probably would not come back for a fullon meal the tapas were good but not creative nor memorable .
everything i tried here was amazing i could not believe how delicious the blueberry pancakes were crazy good you have to try this place out its small so you may have to wait but its totally worth it .
bad very very bad there was nothing on the menu that did amaze us portions really small expect tapitas and not tapas just another bad version of spanish cuisine using the tapas excuse to rip you off .
two words pure bliss the blueberry pancakes with maple butter were simply orgasmic worth the wait hands down .
not too impressed dissapointed with the bar service and the sangrias which were watered down if i am paying 9 for a drink it better be a good one .
i never sit down just get take out coffee and pastries theyre friendly and quick everythings moist buttery and delicious .
have to downgrade to two stars went recently and my friend ordered a medrare steak and scallops steak came out well done he couldnt even choke down the scallops it was sad haha my meal was good but overpriced .
amazing food great blueberry pancakes and the buttermilk syrup is a special treat just the line is ridiculous and the staff seems burnt out by it i recommend getting carryout .
happy new year joe lets start the new year off by you returning the 1500 worth of products that you took from my business do the right thing joe pace .
five stars for the food four stars because the music is blaring salsa music kinda ruined the ambiance and just doesnt go .
i have celiac this restaurant is not gluten free i ate there and was so sick the next day i also ordered a glass of wine they have the nerve to charge 18 50 a glass i would not recommend this restaurant for anyone that has celiac .
the waitress was super friendly and i loved the atmosphere its a small cute brunch place although the banana walnut pancake was fantastic i actually liked their egg benedict better loved the biscuit .
overpriced and mediocre i ordered a 16 fontina and zucchini risotto dish and it was mediocre tasting and small in portion size it was also so scalding hot i couldnt touch it for what seemed like 10 minutes im definitely not going back to this place .
i wish i could give this place more stars i had the french toast and it was by far the best french toast ive ever had the maple butter is absolutely fantastic wait is a bit long even on a weekday but its worth the wait .
filthy and overpriced i got food poisoned from this place i notice that the silverware was not washed well and didnt give it big importance until i woke up in the morning running to the toilet .
amazing food i loved the blueberry pancakes and spanish scramble the sugar cured bacon is amazing dont pass it up .
upon entering this establishment a wonderful and very appetizing smell hit me i had high hopes however those hopes werent met i thought the flavour of the risotto was bland my friend and i got 2 different risottos but they tasted pretty much the same service was pleasant .
the pancakes were so fluffly worth the wait nuff said .
theres always a line one night there wasnt i pounced i wish i hadnt the entire experience pass undercooked not at all inspired risotto that appeared 10 min after ordering suspect generic meatballs generic salad sorry im not sorry .
eggs are eggs the bread on the side was really good i didnt eat the pancakes but the blueberry ones made me drool when i saw them adorable little place the coffee is weak .
i didnt even get the chance to eat here the staff was so rude that we didnt bother sitting down .
still amazing food coma inducing kind of stuff .
meh the food was so incredibly bland i came home and made myself better risotto that weekend .
we waited about an 1hr and 12 for this place i got the blueberry pancakes which were good and other friends go the french toast and banana walnut pancakes everything was very good but not worth the wait ive had better .
nothing special i was expecting more 12 for a basic risotto that was overcooked and 12 for a third rate glass of red wine i guess is too much .
worth the wait be patient and youll be rewarded although the menu doesnt seem as if there is anything special brunch and pancakes is the way to go i had the chocolate chunk yum and get the bacon wonderful .
terrible overhyped and overpriced for what you actually get if youre going to go anyway just please dont order the beet salad when they say a pinch of truffle oil they really mean a litre and it doesnt even mask the blandness def not going here again .
yeah the blueberry pancakes with maple butter i died eggs benedict too i double died heaven sugar cured bacon meh too sweet otherwise this place is amazeballs .
its glorified not particularly tasty mac cheese at about 16 a pop served in a crowded unventilated restaurant that made 3 people wait 20 minutes for a table on a monday night not impressed .
yep best pancakes around and im a pancake fiend who tries a new pancake recipe out every week at home .
mushy risotto consistency of oatmeal crowded and rushed .
amazingly delicious pancakes biscuits and jam give them a try you wont be sorry .
they do not accept multiple credit cards per table and they are pretty rude when they force this policy on your party need i say more .
worth the 2 5 hour wait try the blueberry pancakes w maple butter and sugar cured bacon .
they dont allow splitting cards unacceptable fix it or i wont return .
i came here for dinner on a friday night no wait and the food was amazing i had the potato pancakes with applesauce and sour cream for my entree i had the grilled pizza everything was delicious definitely coming back here to try there brunch .
overpriced risotto all pretentious about glutenfree hype and our waiter had a huge attitude when he said thanks for reminding me when he himself forgot to add in the tip huge fail .
be prepared to wait but you can give your phone number and they text you when your table is ready but only 5 minutes until they give your table away cash only best pancakes im not even a pancake kind of person the maple butter is amazing .
nothing special at all my risotto had a grainy texture and it was overly chewy ive been wanting to come here for years now i wont return .
dont know what took me so long to try this place now im hooked the pancakes are amazing sugar cured bacon is unbelievably good if you dont mind the wait its worth it this is one of the best breakfastbrunch spots in the city .
i havent been here in years i should have stayed away i guess college nostalgia can only carry the taste buds so far risotteria is to risotto as tads steaks is to steaks actually thats a bit cruel still way over priced for mediocre dishes .
pancakes omg i dont normally like pancakes but the pancakes here are so yum sometimes there is a long wait though so go there early if you can .
over rated over oily over crowded over priced over it .
a friend strongly suggested the blueberry pancakes and after trying them i think im spoiled for life im gonna have to stop by here every time im in town .
wanted to order there for the first time for delivery the said they cant deliver because the driver is not in today i really dislike when places offer a service they cant provide .
perfectly made pancakes wish it wasnt cash only .
never again they came about 90 minutes late with my food and the delivery person didnt have the decency to hand me my food left it at my door no knock first impressions speak a thousand words food was average .
i give this place 4 stars cause i really do dislike places that only take cash but the pancakes are really great the blueberry pancakes are damn good fluffy and full of flavor fast service and nice relax spot will def come back .
pros beautiful decor tasty food each worth a star cons embarrassingly bad service from hosts and waiters children size portions tiny 15 dollar cocktails full story to come later .
best pancakes on this side of the atlantic .
their food is good but their takeout takes forever they will make you wait an entire hour and a half for delivery on a monday never again .
pancakes are to die for the wait sucks and often theyre booked up for the entire day but if you can make it early to beat the lines its well worth it .
the sushi was just ok the miso soup was fine they forgot one roll the rice was a bit too soggy overall i think it was too expensive for the quality i dont think ill be ordering again .
delicious .
give them time and it could be good it has potential but id wait awhile before going there .
best blueberry pancakes ever and the sugar cured bacon was a bonus very happy .
people that work there do not care service very bad food was not cooked right do not go .
holy fluffalufulous batman talk about some fluffy pancakes man theyre like cloud cakes with blueberry gems and that hot maple butter is ridiculously slammin .
the food was average and the hostesses and managerowner were very condescending i felt uncomfortable the entire time i wouldnt return or recommend with so many other options in the area .
pancakes are soft and delicious mimosas and bellini are awesome nice cozy not loud will be returning .
i am surprised this place has 4 stars the food is not that great come on guys i came here on sunday for brunch to find hairs and an unclean table a nonchalant waiter and very very dry muffins lets just say i am never coming here again .
i agree that their blueberry pancakes is the best especially with their maple butter it just melted in my mouth i also recommend their egg benedict i will definitely go back next time .
if you like egg shells in your scrambled eggs this place is for you fruit is nice thats about it .
blueberry pancake is the best not so into it for the banana walnut pancake rosemary sausage is too dry but egg benedict is very very good .
oy vey this place is so messy we saw food debris everywhere every fixture just seems so random and disorganized and the carpet smells like a dirty kitchen eaw our food was mediocre one of those dry omelets youd get at a diner .
blueberry pancakes ohhh emmm gg deliscious .
i love the convenience of day by day good size portions reasonable prices fast service i think the food is very good but not great their huevos rancheros was dry and less tasty vs most other huevos rancheros also it needs to be spicier atmosphere is bland .
best breakfast in nyc .
this review is long overdue but there was a long long hair cooked into my omlette yuck yuck and more yuck .
worth the 2 hour wait for the best pancakes ever an even better tip is to go during the week and have a breakfast for dinner .
the food was okay nothing worth a 12 hour wait for and certainly nothing i couldnt make better at home this is a good brunch place i will pray for philadelphia .
this is my favorite brunch spot hands down must get blueberry pancakes sugar cured bacon fried green tomatoes steak and eggs special smoked salmon eggs benedict it is absolutely amazing and completely worth the wait .
wow was it disgusting or maybe i was just lucky to get the chef who thought hollendaise sauce is brothy with chunks of powder in it mmmmm .
amazing breakfast i had no idea breakfast could taste so good best blueberry pancakes ive ever had great sweet and salty combo if you share the pancakes and the spanish scramble cute casual breakfast spot .
brutally awful on all accounts fish is extra not fresh and mealy as well the rice is generally served cold as ice which is pretty offensive never go here also never order from here also dont eat anything from here unacceptable .
blueberry pancakes enough said candied bacon coffee and eggs benedict all 1010 or in yelps case 5 stars .
what a disappointment after reading favorable reviews for starters though delivery was quick charge for crab fried rice in coconut was 18 though listed as 14 on the line moreover the dish was tasteless at best never again .
the pancakes were especially fluffy and there is something special in that maple syrup it was almost caramelized and had this delicious super sugary taste the blueberry topped pancakes are the most popular you cant go wrong there .
they took away our dishes before we finish our food its the worst service ive experienced in nyc they dont take credit card and asked us out because there are customers queuing the attitudes are amazingly bad .
blueberry pancakes here are heaven fluffy and filling .
the selling point of this place was the diy thai iced tea other than that food was just okay .
great food the cheese grits and blueberry pancakes are amazing get here early because there is usually a wait .
i ordered pad thai and panang curry for takeout i was very disappointed the pad thai was very dry and it had a burned stove taste the curry came with a tiny portion of rice and my husband and i didnt really like that dish either .
had a great breakfast here this morning there was no line which i understand was a miracle according to the other reviews went just after they opened food was outstanding service was great as well great experience .
terribly service one of the most obnoxious places i have been to in nyc extremely rude staff who just dont belong in a services business will never go back .
umai pankeki tabemasita funnwari siteite oishikattuta .
extremely bad service we showed up with a party of 5 and were made to wait forever to get a table .
great blueberry pancakes and hash browns perfect with hot sauce well worth the early morning wait .
kids friendly0 accueil0 foodok we didnt have time to ask for desertkf bill was on table to finishno good bye hum hum .
ive been there twice had blueberry pancake and benedict each both were good especially the pancake its featured order make sure not going in weekend sitting in front of the bar would be a good choice .
seriously 1 5 hours to deliver some thai food 4 blocks takes4ever lame dontorder .
amazing food but such a rude hostess when you have to wait that long it would have been nice to have someone pleasant to deal with .
service portion and atmosphere was nice food meh i had pad thai a la panang and spicy basil lo mein noodle probably the worst thai food ive ever had huge disappointment not planning on going back except maybe to try the thai tea l .
we shared the maine blueberry and banana walnut pancakes as good as all the ratings say warm just right mix of crusty and pillowy butter syrup was warm and amazing went at 4 pm on a saturday the wait was 30 minutes .
worst customer service we have three people they ask us seat in one small table thats too crowd .
the food breakfast or dinner is deliscious fresh and always immaculately prepared the staff could not be more pleasant they bartender makes a mean cocktail and the wine list delivers for those that prefer the grape overall awesome .
appetizers were ok green curry worst i ever tried over salted not spicy with bland inidentifiable vegetables boiled to a state of dissolve highly not recommended .
literally waited 3 hours food was delicious definitely try the egg benedict also had the blueberry pancakes baconpepper omlettes and turkey chili so good i dont eat bacon but they made it really crispy and good .
what a sad way to satisfy a thai craving blandest pad thai and som tam i have every tasted if you cant get the basics right why should i bother .
deliciousness that delivers long wait well coordinated worth it .
love the setting the lighting the decor service was fair unfortunately food is beyond overhyped not really digging the whole thai fusion concept while i like the trendy setting as much as the next person would also love to have some rocking thai food to match .
the food is great four stars for the attitude of the hostess though oh and they dont take card which is kind of annoying in this day age but maple butter syrup is absolutely delicious do not come here without ordering pancakes .
horrible .
ughhh so good go and get there early because youre going to wait .
do not get the pad thai it was red and tasted like bbq sauce there were no peanuts to be found also there wasnt any eggplant in the green curry .
southern food in the city .
really people 4 stars very mediocre thai food not sure what all the rave reviews are about pad see ew with tiny thin pieces not even whole strands of noodles and dry overcooked basilless chicken basil and the waiter screwed up me friends order dont believe the hype .
came here for my anniversary dinner had the blueberry pancakes ta die for the maple butter syrup really compliments them i also had the fried green tomatoes 1 12 hour wait totally worth it enjoy .
greasy and gross and disappointing .
good food yes worth waking up at 7 30 in the morning to beat the line forming outside so early no this is a nice place with solid dishes but its really nothing to write home about .
dont know what the hype is about small portion overpriced for a crappy tasting brunch rather go to mcdonalds than eat these garbage definitely not coming back ugh .
came here with a few friends for the last day of pancake month i had the best pancakes ive ever had there crispy banana with their homemade cinnamon chili sauce we were all very pleased will definitely come back here to try more baked deliciousness .
made the mistake of sitting at the bar and they were cleaning glasses by dunking them in sudsy water and then rinsing rings all kinds of unsanitary to me walked out after having been here 4 or 5 times shuckster .
my favorite brunch place in the whole of nyc 2 hour wait can be used efficiently by shopping in soho they allow you to chck your status online and they text you too bravo sugarcured bacon blueberry pancakes a must .
not worth the trip .
definately not overrated the wild main blueberry pancakes were amazing warm maple butter complements it so well p s you can get the pancakes to go but i wouldnt recommend it it just doesnt taste the same .
not a fan .
omg i came back here and ordered the banana smoothie according to elsie w its the best thing in life i wanna come back just to get the smoothie .
over priced and pretentious service lacking a second cup of coffee would have been appreciated food ehhhh 80 for breakfast for 4 .
i guess i lucked out when i came with my cousin and a friend at 910am on a weekday no wait what a cute place great service excellent coffee we thought the pancakes were some of the best weve ever had nonetheless crazy expensive for pancakes tis ny .
after a long wait my sandwich was presented with so much salty gooey mayolike sauce i had one bite and had to stop for me dudleys was an expensive dud .
carb overload and i dont feel guilty at all ordered blueberry pancakes very flavorful and served with plenty of warm maple butter very filling meal the last few bites were a challenge since i was full even on a full stomach their biscuits were beckoning me .
fine not great servers are space cadets but nice juices are always refreshing and tasty especially the watermelon but food is hitormiss burgers and side veggies tend to be greasy .
this is hands down the best brunch ive ever had and the wait was completely worth it every dish at our table of four was mouthwateringly delicious every time ive gotten brunch since ive compared it to my meal here .
they buy their steaks from omaha steaks saw the delivery man as we leaving the restaurant .
the wait here is insane but soo worth it ive been here 3 times and waited an hr and a half and another time 2 hrs the blueberry pancake is the most popular item and it is delicious .
p good food but shitbad service the kind that transcends ineptitude by repeatedly trying to extort 5080 tips yuck .
blueberry pancakes cant go wrong try going on the weekday because the wkend wait can be brutal .
terrible service some idiot pretending to have diabetes had her friend server usher us out of our seats after we ordered so much food wine 50 tip desert and drinks do not go here .
their sugar cured bacon is absolutely amazing their pancakes french toast and biscuit were also yummy but that bacon wow it was hands down one of the best things ive ever eaten .
we were hoping to try some of traditional latin food there was nothing unique nor special about their food the place looks nice and the atmosphere is alright too expensive for the type of food that they serve .
amazing just go dont read through all these reviews just go pancakes waffles everything is to die for .
way overpriced sloppy service after one hour the food came out and the fries were cold and soggy obviously second attempt still soggy .
best cheese grits ever .
literally my friend got punched in the face there and the owner did nothing this place needs to be off the market .
hands down best blueberry pancakes ive ever tasted right downto the texture syrup service was ok but the menu was great ill definitely come back for more .
fuck this place friend had his bag stolen by an employee when confronted about it got the runaround heard the food is good but i wont be finding out he got his laptop back but shined on the bag again fuck this guy .
the best pancake ever in my whole life i hope they open in la too .
i didnt realize that 24pm in robbinsville is siesta posting your totally silly business hours here would be nice maybe someday .
the most delicious and best quality breakfast brunch ive ever had in my life pancakes and biscuits taste like clouds from heaven stand in line to wait but omg its worth it plus the owners do cooking classes with the local community which is awesome m .
crust is always burned the edges and bottom are a deep charcoal black the best pizza when its not overcooked but sadly anymore thats the norm too bad cause the salads are exceptional when not overcooked so is the pizza .
i came here twice and both times i waited for over an hour but worth it i find myself craving their blueberry pancakes frequently if theres a wait there make the right decision and suck it up you wont regret it .
the music got so loud toward the end of the night that you couldnt even hear it over all fail .
the blueberry pancakes with the maple syrup is to die for very filling and flavorful cons it cost an additional 2 for a tiny cup of maple syrup if you finish the first one service was good there is usually a wait at this place .
went here during restaurant week and was sorely disappointed especially since ive heard such amazing things about them i ordered their pumpkin tiramisu and i think they made it with something spoiled because it was sour .
i had brunch there and it was simply exquisite from the omelet to the pancakes go early to avoid waiting too much personally i waited for like 2 hours but it was entirely worth it believe me you wont regret it also not expensive at all .
mediocre food horrendous service from all the employees we encountered we will not be returning .
comfortablecasual atmosphere and the pancakes with warm maple butter and biscuits are really tasty go in the middle of a week day and you may not have to wait at all .
im only giving this one star because the menu looked absolutely delicious we sat down and werent greeted by anyone for 10 minutes we ended up walking out i cant begin to explain how annoying this is we obviously left without eating really disappointing .
definitely worth the wait an drive went this past monday for the nice birthday breakfast ordered blueberry pancakes an sugar cured bacon absolutely delicious .
the worst place ever im going to sum this up real quick not busy no service only water provided within the first 1015 minutes of being seated unfortunately they lost a great customer and awesome tips on to the next one .
excellent definately worth a trip there .
food was so bland i desperately sought out seasoning and nothing helped half of the beers on the draft list were no longer available bad food overpriced beer wont go back .
the wait was really long for breakfast but it was definitely worth it .
went for sipz the drinks were mehhh they tasted like lemonade wout any alcohol considering its beer week i was disapointed with their beer selection the pork taquitos were good though .
this is my third time here every time i had a good time and had good food milk shake is a must try french onion soup is hot and amazing love the potato skin bacon egg benedict is definitely worth trying spicy shrimp grits are also good .
food was good but service slowwwwwww 3 beers in 2 hours really .

ive been there 2 times the food is great but the service sucked both times .
i do love all breakfast here .
i came here to try turducken sandwich because i saw it on foodnetwork it was very disappointing didnt taste good and other food is just average for the price i paid for .
best pancakes ever period .
the food was boring the service was clearly bored with us expensive for very mediocre sandwiches .
ive been dreaming about another brunch here for the last 2 years even waiting in line for 2 hours sounds like fairytale in my dreams blueberry pancakes are heaven an experience to try .
the food is soso the service is challenged and it is very noisy even when it is half empty .
blueberry pancakes the best in the world ive been here twice and i was not disappointed be prepared to wait in line this is a must go place for me whenever i visit nyc .
the food was ok the atmosphere really nice but the service bad we had to find the waitressit took forever .
there is no food in the world worth waiting three hours that being said my blueberry pancakes were amazing my friends potato pancakes with lox were great too it makes sense to go if you can put your name on the list and kill time for two hours .
i am so furious right now horrible service i never review but i had to write this review because i really wanna share with everyone how disrespectful the bartender treated my friends and i racist if you come good luck ordering my fellow minorities horrible .
went here for my birthday dinner walking in you can just smell the goodness we had a mix of breakfast and dinner you must try to chicken and waffles i definitely want to back for brunch must visit .
ive been here twice for lunch in the past month the first time it took over 2 hours to get my food i wouldnt believe it if it didnt happen to me the second time it took 45 minutes to get a burger awful .
party of 6 second group on line at 815am for a 9am open of restaurant excellent food service our entire group was extremely pleased with the breakfast my only complaint is that the tables are too close together highly recommend .
extremely loud and crowded on a saturday night no room to do anything but stand and say excuse me all night .
although there was a 30 minute wait it was well worth it i got the banana walnut pancakes with maple butter and they were incredible also my friend got huevos rancheros which was excellent spicy fresh flavorful its a must for breakfastbrunch .
came here for an after work happy hour i have to say the food was really terrible and the service wasnt the best it seems like a chill bar but we were hoping to have a lil drunk din and it wasnt happenin .
great french toast amazing waiting system they text you when they want you to come for your table and have an online site that shows you the wait and how many people in front of you thats great service there cash only though .
i found a black hair on my manicotti but they were nice enough to give me a refund .
want pancakes and dont want to wait in line go during dinner still good .
food not that great went there several time all time food takes forever and is always cold .
love their chocolate chip pancakes the best in nyc their waiting time is ridiculous so make sure to have a light breakfast before going there .
sorry not impressed 13 dollars for a hot dog cheese burger and a soda burger did not stand out music from the kitchen was annoying .
those pancakes were so damn good i mightve teared a little while taking slow bites of the blueberry pancakes so worth the 2 hour wait yeah its an experience .
the food is very good the cafe has recently changed ownership and the service has steadily declined the last two times that i was there i went before noon to beat the rush and still had to wait 20 plus minutes for a sandwich .
best damn pancakes ive ever had period also dont pass up on the bacon which is basically food crack worth every minute of the wait .
great decoration nice atmosphere but kitchen closed at 1030 p m when the place closes at 200 a m disapointed with this for tuesday night also for such a hip and upscale place in the ironbound please hire sexy and and more attentive ladies for serversbartenders .
phenomenal pancakes phenomenal butterscotch sundaes thats pretty much enough to garner 5 stars right there dont go for weekend brunch unless you want to wait a long long time they serve their entire breakfast menu at all times of day every day of the week .
skip service was horrible when the food came out the waitress had no clue what roll was which and got everything mixed up the decor was nice though .
this place is amazing all around came on a weekend and only waited 30 mins not too shabby the pancakes were nice and fluffy and the eggs benedict was amazing i loved how they added green onions to it .
im on a quest to find the best dumplings in town and this was my first stop the dumplings are meh i feel like they were reheated which was a little disappointing but they hit the spot the dumpling sauce is strangely spicy .
i agree with most people here pancakes r good but to the tune of waiting 2 12 hours never again will i go on a sunday coffee is strong like starbucks i think the trick is the melted butter in the syrup makes the pancackes taste good .
f this prace they give you whatever they have reftover you order chicken and broccori the give you 1 spoonful of chicken broccori and a shitload of white rice not ordered motherfuckers live in basement with the rats they serve hope hamden cops send them packing .
tuesday 930am 30 minute wait line out the door didnt expect this the eggs benedict on a biscuit was delish i think even better than the famous blueberry pancakes worth the wait cash only .
battersby has a really nice atmosphere and presents very attractive plates unfortunately the food was bland and overpriced the fish chowder was barely warm and the gnocchi barely had flavor a truly disappointing experience same your time and money go somewhere else .
i came here for dinner recently and it was extremely underwhelming my friend got the fried fish sandwich a special and there was only a small nugget size portion of fish in there i would give this place 2 stars for dinner but 5 stars for brunch .
i just wish they dont use as much as msg to make their food tasty .
pancakes so good you would smack yo momma for them enough said 4 stars because its cash only cash only really dude otherwise 5 stars the pancakes are good the buttersyrup is better than life that is all .
i went with my family on labor day not happy never go again food mediocre for the hour wait .
magical blueberry pancakes i dont even like blueberries or pancakes long wait is well worth itdrink some juice across the street .
i highly reiterate denton xs review also the outdoor idea seems cute but i ended up with 8 mosquito bites on my leg clearly they had a better time feasting than i did .
pancakes were good you must try the jam they bring on the side this place would truly be excellent but they over cooked our eggs benedict .
i guess if you order the drinks on their menu they are great but if you go in there and ask for a cocktail that is different even a classic one like a french 75 they are incapable it was watered down champagne nothing artisan about that .
the sugar cured bacon and the butter infused maple syrup are reason enough to visit here on a daliy basis .
pancakes were average with some fresh fruit aka three slices of banana and half of a strawberry egg sandwich was served with a burned roll but somehow soggy with so many brunch options in williamsburg theres no room for mediocre expensive food .
chicken and waffle was great .
theres nothing memorable about this place the service and the food are nothing to rave about ive been here twice thinking i should give it a chance but now i know better the eggs benedict and omelets are bland and worth going elsewhere for .
amazing food the vanilla buttermilk waffle was to die for wild blueberry pancakes so tasty eggs benedict great staple with a twist biscuit and sugar cured bacon our waitress was not friendly she is the only reason for 4 stars instead of 5 .
ok 3 star food 1 for dirty 1 bad service 1 star rating .
only came for dessert with my bf i had the pineapple cake very nice and buttery came here around 930pm so there wasnt much wait time but even at this time of night more than half of the restaurant was full .
probably some of the disappointment rests with me menu is more about sharing apps than having a proper entree burgers were just fine but nothing special service was fine .
we got a side of sugarcured bacon and i loved it .
terrible service staff not friendly or helpful wont be going back go to jack doyles or stitch instead .
line is worth it best bacon in nyc biscuits are amazing as is their raspberry jam .
i spent the saturday night went to dinner with friends but the menu is not good dont have the stek a lot of salt without flavor was not delicious and then we decided to go out and go to another bar ill be back here .
couldnt resist the chocolate cake .
over 50 beers on draft and 50 in bottle so a good selection of craft but theyve recently replaced their menu with a more expensive less filing tapas style menu its delicious but its just not the kind of food i want when drinking craft beer .
came here on a weekday cant stand the lines on the weekend the pancakes were very good obviously fresh the steak was also very good get the fried green tomatoes you wont be disappointed .
mexican food was ok didnt have guacamole lame waitress was rude and had no suggestion for the unavailable guacamole go to other mexican venues in burlington .
came back for the blueberry pancakes we got our order in 5 minutes before the kitchen closed and it hit the spot as usual yes we had pancakes at 11pm and they were grrrrreat .
the margaritas had too much sour mix didnt taste like margaritas totally disappointed in the tacos and nachos wont go back .
the blueberry pancakes are phenomenal hands down the best ive had i also ordered the buscuit it was okay at a prior visit i had the brioche french toast which was good and unique but not quite as palatable as the pancakes they only take cash no card .
got turned away at 1110pm on a tuesday even though their website and yelp said open till midnight boo .
if youre willing to wait the food here is fantastic especially try the pancakes i personally had the chicken waffles and that was the best one ive had yet .
charging for chips and salsa is purely bush league nice use of local ingredients two tablespoons of under seasoned ingredients doesnt justify the price of tacos makes me miss the oasis .
i love this place i have never been disappointed in their brunch i have however been disappointed in their wait if you want to go for brunch or lunch then get there when it opens you cant go wrong .
food ok service sucks .
very good pancakes but a bit pricey the daily special cost an extra 2 dollars for a sprinkling of coconut flakes .
i was so happy to see that there was no line so i ordered two small orders of roasted pork and roasted duck it was mostly fat and no meat lots of rice no thank you .
the hour wait was worth it pancakes were fluffy mounds of love i want to be paula deen and drink the maple butter .
mehhh their roast pork is not the same anymore lacking the honey and texture .
this place is a bit pricey but amazing go for breakfast .
dont know why people like this place the broth lacks flavor ingrdients are low quality and service is bad .
i can see why they are rated as the best pancakes in nyc i always go blueberry believe the hype two hour waits on the weekends are common place the place is tiny and not suited for large groups cash only .
terrible i had the shrimp pasta and it tasted like watered shrimp truly one of the worst meals ive ever had ever boo flavor what so ever the ambiance and drinks are nice but im not coming here again .
another review wrote they are cash only not true description by yelp says they do not deliver not true like everyone says pancakes are great bobo garlic chicken is good also biscuits i feel like arent savory enough .
wouldnt take coupon they put out shame because the food is ok especially pho and rice .
february is pancake month go for pancake month .
ordered the pork sandwich which looked huge on the photo when i got it there was little pork the sandwich and couple strips of green pepper a joke .
it was worth the wait delish .
late on the ice water no one checked on us until we were finished didnt offer desserts pho broth was salty im not even going to dignify this place with a fulllength review .
the best yes best brunch in the city blueberry pancakes enough said .
food is good service really sucks i dont know where the waiter and waitresses came from but they are very rude they speak really fast making it hard to understand always feel rushed and mistreated as a customer where do you find these people on earth .
best pancakes ive ever had the sugar cured bacon didnt hurt their coffee doesnt taste like poop .
their pizza is a lot like dominos .
blueberry pancakes with sugar cured bacon was delishh i plan on coming back for their pancake specials and try a new one each time the rest of the menu looks great too .
good thin crust pizza but terrible prices and service will never go back ill get my thin crust pizza from star tavern .
best blueberry pancakes ive ever had they served them with some kind of custardycarmel sauce which wasnt too sweet just perfect .
this place is very meh nothing great to report its a little pricey and the staff can be arrogant at times as far as italian places in the caldwellveronamontclair area is concerned you can do a lot better than this place .
this place is always crowded even when door open in the am but for good reason they have the most amazing blueberry pancakes out of this world .
service is horrible phone girls are retarded everyone who works there looks like theyve smelt something bad .
good but also overrated given the long lines .
dont waste your money tried this place a number of times i was disappointed every time plenty of local places that are much better .
the secret to their pancakes is the butter maple syrup it is to die for you just gotta try it yourself .
over priced for poor quality food veal was a low grade very tough the chicken franchise had no flavor the antipasto was good save your money and go somewhere you know is good already .
okay dont mess with anything other than the sugar cured bacon its awesome pancakes are pretty good too .
people talk about this restaurant really good for me this place never surprise me i just dont like the food again really i just dont like the food can i put half star .
great breakfast but really long wait recommended pancakes .
this business is shut down .
this is the best brunch that ive had in nyc youre going to have to wait awhile for a table especially on a weekend but it is definitely worth it .
i dont like this place at all pastry selections are small roast pork bun it was bland and fatty not good cup cakes wasnt airy they were hard bland and stale im disappointed management is horrible .
awesome breakfast place ordered 3 takeout breakfast dishes to survive on while in hospital for babys birth the best pancakes with warm maple butter the best pancakes ever brioche french toast very good country breakfast solid .
too pricey for what they offer a mediocre sandwich its not as great as a lot of the reviews say the menu is really small too so im surprised why they are charging so much low food cost nice enough staff .
vibe small packed smells yummy eat the blueberry pancakes best pancakes ever a side of bacon doesnt hurt obligatory catchy remark very new york one of the best breakfasts ive ever had i think my cheeks gained three pounds afterwards worth it .
pricey lacking flavor and inspiration the sandwiches had minimal taste .
best pancakes ive ever had .
awful no flavor just heat overpriced and limited menu the help wasnt well trained go elsewhere .
biscuits are great will come back but the wait can be a pain .
ok we went here because everyone said this is the best cheesecake ever fail it is the worst cheesecake ever .
superb food the service lacked at times and the space is extremely cramped be prepared to wait an average of 3045 minutes no matter what time of day you arrive highly recommended as a breakfast gem .
overrated my cheesecake taste like it had been sitting in the fridge with left overs you know when your food is contaminated and attacked by all the odor filled crap you need to throw out .
long overdue review one of the places to hit up brunch in nyc why else do they have 1200 reviews pancakes eggs shakes doesnt disappoint the hype a tasty cup of coffee and you can deal with the wait read up the masses agree .
dont know if i ate on a busy sunday afternoon or chose the wrong dishes but this was the most tasteless meal ive had in this city the baby ribs wss still ok but the steakburger was awful and so was the thick cut chips really disappointing .
you gotta getup early for clintons very good blue berry pancakes which we shared good eggs benedict apple smoked bacon oh yea excellent fresh squeezed orange juice .
food is nothing special service is terrible not friendly slow hard to get a refill on coffee or water .
blueberry pancakes with maple butter need i say more .
the burger had a huge amount of meat the fries were lackluster the onion rings were overbattered and raw now we heard the cheesecake was among the best in the country it was okay the strawberry topping was quite good but the pie pretty usual tasting to me .
hands down the best pancakes ive ever had i highly recommend getting the blueberry pancakes and the sugar cured bacon its worth the wait .
service staff let us waiting for more than ten minutes to take our order restaurant was 30 full they were laughing and having fun among themselves burgers were super overcooked and totally blend i used to come quite often but looks like this place is not the same .
great burgers .
bad service server so unfriendly one of them spilled water on my cheesecake and didnt even comp it cheesecake meh its mediocre no better than store bought .
clinton street baking company is the place to go for breakfast at lower east side pancakes french toasts any sorts of eggs are delicious the place is very busy always crowded so make sure you bring some time along or reserve a table .
the cake is ny standard of coursr some come with straw wrappers from god knows what inside see pics nasty also the cash register girl didnt put in what we ordered good thing we checked overall just overrated with no reason to go .
pancakes are amazing but lines are deceptively long you are allowed to put your name down and come back .
tried breakfast today it sucks order the corn beef omelette it had one slice of corn beef potatoes were over cooked try somewhere else .
great breakfast another really popular nyc spot get here early you do not want to wait in line the pancakes are delicious especially the chocolate chip ones only drawback cash only and breakfast for two will set you back 40 it is nyc though .
cheesecake was very disappointing maybe slightly better than cheesecake factory too sweet and creamy dont be fooled that this is authentic ny cheesecake .
very good breakfast get the sugar cured bacon on the side i didnt try the pancakes which are supposed to be to die for so ill be back they have a solid 3060 min wait go in pairs for faster seating near katz enjoy .
worst place ever found a pebble like substance in my soup it was disgusting do yourself a favor dont eat here terrible .
worth the wait even if its 2 hours i dream about there pancakes they should really think of expanding the place or at least have outdoor sitting but to the point if you havent eaten there then you havent had real good pancakes .
two words tourist trap super long wait loud and pricey for the quality of food the location in brooklyn is definitely better .
really more like 3 5 but whatever the pancakes biscuits maple butter and hash browns are all awesome the ham and eggs were kinda normal its very good but not worth more than a 30 minute wait .
if possible no starsif you eat here do not use a credit cardthey have now charged over 106 for a 75 meal this past week having to file disputes with my bank against them do not go there the food isnt even that good .
best place ever if you couldnt eat here because it was too busy you can always buy their cookbook off amazon .
its okay .
theres always a line about an hour long its a little better if you go during the weekdays get the pancakes the blueberry pancake was amaaaaaaaaaazing totally worth the wait the other stuff was oooook .
great location and inside looks awesome worth a try but the food is average and the table and dishes were kind of dirty still toast and potatoes were good but the corn beef hash was tough and the eggs poorly poached .
you have gotta try the french toast with bananas and pecans to die for ok maybe not die but well worth the calories come on youre eating in new york surely you will walk it off on your way to the bus or subway a must to try .
i went there bc if reviews but i left without ordering food they were extremely rood and careless never again .
pancakes so fluffy servings so large unable to finish left with tummies full and happy .
eh not great i had the scoop salad the potato salad was great shrimp salad not so much cheesecake was average crazy crowded .
this is what love tastes like we arrived here right when they opened and they already had a line the place was totally cute and i liked the music i had the banana pancakes which were so delicious i cant wait to go back here .
went here while in ny food was decent our server was horrible didnt want to give any refills took forever to get food very unfriendly dont recommend .
delicious blueberry pancakes and maple butter recommend coming here for dinner same menu but no crowds and no ridiculous 12 hour wait for a table also try the wonderful fried chicken with vanilla buttermilk waffle .
this place is eh basic diner food service isnt that great either i had the lobster roll which was good and had plenty of lobster all in all it deserves only 2 stars 1 for service and 1 for the food .
my all time favorite breakfastbrunch place to go love it pancakes here are to die for the omelettes are also amazing yummers if you want to get in on a weekend better be there early the place is small so it doesnt pack too many people .
took some out of towners here for dessert after a broadway show because it was nearby the place is fine just nothing special good for kids bad for people who know cheesecake .
breakfast is amazing here but it is a long wait the earlier you show up the better to avoid the line .
very disappointed in this famous cheesecake i went with the plain cheesecake the texture was off and i didnt like the crust the actual cheesecake was too sweet which is unusual for me to say its the first time ever i didnt finish my dessert .
had the most incredible brunch probably the best ive ever had yes the wait was long however it was well worth it the pancakes french toast potato pancakes all amazing you must try .
went there for lunch and also to celebrate my birthday super slow service we ordered a turkey sandwich and it was gross will never go back again they are destroying their empire what a shame .
this is a solid breakfast place but not worth the wait what place is really the biscuits are even better than the pancakes helpful hint show up before they start serving booze or wait out the line across the street at the coffee shop .
kids liked the pancakes i had egg whites dont come for breakfast 2 orders pancakes eggwhites and a pc of cheese cake 61 bucks no thanks .
got the banana walnut pancakes and the southern breakfast the southern breakfast might have been the best meal of my ny trip very light great cheese grits fried green tomatoes delicious sugarcured bacon is on point the pancakes were delicious too .
started out great amazing coffee went down hill quickly overpriced horrible service wont be back .
this is the famous clinton st baking company with new yorks best pancakes was it absolutely it was soo good yummy too bad i ordered some egg sandwich but had some of the pancakes from my friend will come back for sure and get nothing but pancakes .
a tourist trap pure and simple but when youre waiting for the show to start and you just need a cheesecake this is where you have o go .
come for dinner on weekdays no wait and daily specials brunch wise id recommend the maple butter on everything .
cheesecake was the saving grace pastrami ruben was the worst ive ever had fatty grisly with not much flavor the coleslaw pickles werent very good staff was good seating was quick my friend enjoyed her salad .
i absolutely love the pancakes here whenever i have any friends that come for out of town this is the first place that i always take them too the only thing is that ive always had to wait but it was always worth it in the end .
coffee was lukewarm eggs were gross how do you go wrong with eggs canadian bacon cold and potatoes tasted like oil tourist trap for sure in times square only went there as it was only place open and had 4 star reviews dont let it fool you .
went for lunch on a busy sunday afternoon always a crowd but theres a reason why i had the fish poboy delicious the bread was perfect homemade chips that went well with the sandwich definitely a must but be sure to arrive early and expect a wait .
the positive thing about this place was the food is screaming like the buttons on a fat mans shirt the service was horrid placing the order the waiter argued with me and gave no options or suggestions .
rough wait but amazing food absolutely worth it the host brought out pancake slices for those waiting on the street part of me was grateful the other part of me hated him for this cruelest form of teasing .
i am sure the food is great but the staff was very unfriendly .
5 stars for the blueberry pancakes these are the most fluffiest pancakes i ever had in my life i really love the soft cakey texture and the perfectly sweet batter with blueberries the honey cured bacon was ok i would just stick to the pancakes .
went here for lunch on a normal friday bad attitude among waiters foodprice ratio didnt make sense .
biscuits and raspberry jamnuff said come here early or wait an eternity well worth stuffing your face with such goodness .
i dont get the hype over these cheesecakes the deli sandwiches are nothing special either ill probably try the cheesecake again but definitely pass on the food .
if you can stand the wait the pancakes are excellent everything else is good but i think the pancakes are the only thing worth waiting 2 hours for .
subpar cheesecake we ordered the cake with cheesecake so maybe that was the problem the sweetness of the icing made the cheesecake taste near bitter maybe both would be better enjoyed separately .
downsides the extremely long wait even at 11am on a rainy monday the kinda rude staff and the extra 2 for more maple butter oh and no wireless because they dont want people to hang around upsides stellar pancakes grits and food yumm .
stay away lousy service and autograts check with 18 gratuity .
the blueberry pancakes are out of this world the fish tacos are super yum the service is great but it gets super crowded on the wes so go at an off time they were very sweet to my young daughter would definitely go back .
best cheesecake um no that is what i went there for and that is what the two stars are for that is all i can say .
best pancakes i have ever eaten nuff said .
lame overrated rude waiters tourist trap terrible for food allergy concerns the food was pretty good but the service was awful so no thanks .
usually a savory type of breakfast eater but the blueberry pancakes were delish wasnt too sweet but oozed with the natural berry flavor portion was generous grits were yummy too the wait for this place can get out of control and they dont take reservations for brunch .
juniors you are slipping changing the way you make your strawberry cheesecake just to save some money my slice had a bite of strawberry but tablespoons of gel filling stop being cheap you have many loyal fans go back to the old way of making cheesecake .
tasty tasty tasty pancakes were fluffy caramel sauce was sweet and the blueberries were perfectly fresh well done clinton st we also tried the spanish omelet which had some very interesting flavors service was friendly and prompt .
after 380 previous reviews ill merely offer the following two tips they bring complimentary pickles and slaw with your meal not breakfast and they use foxs ubet chocolate syrup for their egg creams rating based on our standard mediocre breakfast .
pancake sugar cured bacon .
this place is a complete and utter shit show although the menu is expansive and i did manage to steal a coffee mug from here .
i love this place the pancakes are very fluffy and yummy blueberry pancakes are the best is the wait worth it of course i would definetely come back here again on my next visit to nyc .
just ok wasnt terrible but wasnt great service was good didnt have cheesecake as we were there for breakfast dont think well be back .
i mean what can i say i love this place the blueberry pancakes are simply amazing for savory the farmers plate was great only disappoinment was the brioche french toast which was just alright .
cheesecake is super dense and rich with no graham crust which makes me feeling like im just eating a block of cream cheese i had high hopes for real ny cheesecake but it left me unsatisfied over hyped and not that good .
not much more to say that hasnt already been said pancakes are perfect scones and baked goods perfect had eggs benedict and even the biscuits underneath the hollandaise screamed were perfect too go midweek and avoid the rush but whatever you do just go .
this place is crowded with tourists and is overpriced i had gone to the bathroom before i left and saw a gentleman come out of the stall with a chefs hat on and did not wash his hands before heading out the door .
very tasty brunch came in on monday morning post xmas weekend and during the blizzard wait time 5 minutes we got lucky as the line all the other days seemed to be at least an hour long food delicious service meh the guy was cranky .
the cheesecake here is overrated id rather eat at the cheesecake factory trust me im fat i own cheesecake thighs .
came here with some friends from denver over the summer and enjoyed the best breakfast ive ever had this place is worth the wait the service was top notch and the food was as good as it gets .
ive heard the cheesecake is great the food at this restaurant however is nothing special typical touristtrap fare if youre from out of town and want to eat in times square go to carmines otherwise check out the other neighborhoods .
the pancakes are sick do they sprinkle crack in there not sure if its worth the 15 but it was definitely the best i ever had the wait however cost it one star .
i got to experience a little slice of the heartland last night when i stopped at juniors for a cheeseburger after seeing the highly excellent play august osage county what a weak cheeseburger and the fries pooh its all times square deserves i suppose .
how many more reviews does this place really need one more its really amazing and will change the way you view pancakes the end .
the roast pork and the black beans rice were flavorless absolutely no hint of seasoning .
amazing soup forget mimosas get the soups cauliflower almond truffle oil and squash pumpkin heaven sugar cured bacon crispier version of the chinese pork jerky yum p s cash only .
ordered delivery food does not show up for 2 hours i keep calling every 15 minutes they keep telling me its on its way eventually they tell me they forgot to send it no apology nothing .
delicious fluffy blueberry pancakes that were deserving of the best pancakes title liked the warm maple butter eggs benedict were pretty good too though ive had better biscuits .
no pickles on my cuban they skimp on the green sauce sophies will now be my place of choice .
i used to live down the street from this joint brunch on the weekend is madness with huge lines if you are like me who just hate waiting i recommend checking it out for weekday breakfasts and dinners good coffees pastries comfy foods and very nice service .
pretty blanddry food rice but also the stews but very filling and very cheap with higher health standards than real food cartstrucks i still prefer sophies this is a replacement for a burger or a slice not ethnic thaiindian food if that makes sense .
brunch was nice ppl friendly food was fresh and tasty pork loin omelettes pancakes were delicious .
cheaters liars and thieves double charged my credit card wont give my money back had to dispute the charge on with amex .
the buttermilkfried chicken and blueberry pancakes were great but stay off the pizza we also had the gin sling and lemon squash cocktails they were really fresh but pretty sour definitely a great place for good food .
this reviiew is only about the empanadas they were too greasy dough undercooked and filling was just had too much cumin maybe order something else dishes do look delicious too bad tina cant prepare great empanadas .
love the pancakes service juices my only gripe is the price 13 for pancakes is steep i know they are famous for it but geez i never leave here spending less than 25 i really wish they would open a second location it is just too too small .
two of us shared the pernil meal and got sick within a hour of eating there restaurant rated b no wonder never going to eat there again .
yummmmers got the buttermilk biscuit sandwich and split the blueberry pancakes so good worth the wait for nyc yes .
first and last check in here the place hasnt been updated in 40 years food was awful .
best brunch in nyc shitty dining room favs huevos rancheros pancakes .
terrible pizza rude staff i wont be coming back the bartender was especially rude and condescending .
mmmmmmm good everything blueberry pancakes sausage cuts hash browns bacon and eggs all served in true crowded seating nyc style complete with air conditioning above dripping water on your head and on your food and id do it again .
pizzas were ok dessert very good but overall it is not worth the price you pay however the place is really nice and service was good so if you like dont care of the price i would recommend .
goddamn those fuckin pancakes also if you arent prepared to wait at least an hour dont go .
just got take out from there the wonton soup was not hot and the noodles were awful something must be wrong since before this they were at least 4 star .
the cheese grits and sugar cured bacon totally rocked my world i still think about it and its been two years since ive been there .
very stingy on their products they hardly fill any sandwich i prefer the subway across the street .
i really cant say anything that hasnt already been said best brunch .
my party of four was seated and 30 minutes later still no waiter other tables seated after us had drink orders delivered and food orders taken we just left .
its worth waiting in line please go and experience it for yourself .
ive been a patron of this restaurant for over 5 years descent bar food over priced dinner but recently my experience with their service has been horrible just unfriendly staff and real turn off for locals .
omg the pancakes here i dont even normally like pancakes but they are just so fluffy and soft slightly buttery but not too creamy perfect taste texture almost melts in your mouth but firm enough to be chewy in a good way perfection .
our family has visited on 3 occasions and everytime we leave disappointed the service is below average and the food is mediocre most of our meals arrive luke warm at best this could be a great place with a little attention but personally im done .
leftover pancakes were just as delicious the next day worth 13 if you ask me there is always a huge wait outside of this place but you can always order for takeout even when delivery isnt an option i e brunch time highly recommended .
went a few times for lunch got something with stale onion strings on top that made whole thing un appetizing other time we ate outside and traffic distracted from the food i heard dinner was better but didnt want to venture out to try it .
ahmayzing pancakes .
the hostesses there are incredibly inept i have been there 3 times and it is always a cluster getting a seat especially if you want to sit outside the wasabi wings are great but the rest of the food is just average .
have you ever had fried green tomatoes yes it is so good also they make my favorite blueberry pancake .
not that great of a restaurant if you are looking for frozen food deep fried this is the place for you .
after a long hiatus from clinton street bakery i still have to visit this brunch spot whenever im in new york top dishes to order 1 fried green tomatoes 2 blueberry pancakes .
took 25 min to take my order forgot to put cheese in my burger food is ok service is too slow they need to hire more servers overpriced for what you get .
almost pointless to add another review all i would add is that you should probably try to go during the week good but not worth super long wait times .
drinks okay but the food is pretty nasty the two times ive been there it was served cold burger and fries soup over cooked salad gritty dont waste your money go to wendys .
yes the pancakes were worth the hype the syrup could be a taaad less sweet but i guess thats what makes the pancakes what they are probably common sense but if you go during off hoursdays like during the weekdays its not as crowded as the weekends .
mediocre food nothing special went here during lunch a couple times just for convenience if you have the time and money try the yardley inn .
awsome brunch place the spanish plate was delicious just not to hyped about the lines .
sadly my last experience here left me not wanting more the fish didnt taste particularly fresh and the rice too warm really spoiled the whole sushi experience i havent been back here in a while and unless fuji switches up its game i doubt ill return .
blueberry pancakes with maple butter fried chicken waffles with honey butter buttermilk biscuit sandwich classic extra thick chocolate shake bellini guaranteed amazing brunch in nyc .
i had higher expectations place seemed a little dirty and the food was no better than okay theres definitely better stuff around .
the best breakfast restaurant i have ever visited will revisit again this summer while in nyc .
the food are just ok the sushi are just ok nothing special the hot food are way too salty this is the only japanese restaurant in the area but i would rather drive further down to the other side of town rt 27 and have better sushi .
for our monthly get together me and my girlfriends had a wonderful dinner on a saturday night the ambiance was awesome the food was great the desserts omg i was in heaven this is a place to check out .
the lady that answers the phone has a bad attitude shes very rood and unprofessional she needs serious help mentaly im very disappointed .
long waits even on weekdays apparently delicious pancakes tasty hashbrowns do not get the eggs benedict dont say i didnt warn you .
staff is friendly and sandwiches are good but they used to be great new management raised all the prices and is inconsistent when charging you for the sandwiches so sad .
def best breakfastbrunch in nyc but i really dont understand why people insist on going for brunch the wait is crazy over an hour go during the week for breakfastearly lunch they offer a very similar menu to brunch during the week .
had the ramen here today it wasnt horrible but it definitely fell below average sadly there are so few options for ramen in the city that i might come back if i was in the area but thats highly unlikely .
the blueberry pancakes were fluffy and sweet the blueberries were very juicy also the maple butter didnt disappoint i was on a major sugar high after this next time trying the southern breakfast .
call their number get a fax machine this has happened to me on five or six separate nights they say they deliver apparently they dont .
amazing blueberry pancakes with maple butter syrup mmm .
okay ramen and not very good sushi come here only if you are not very picky about your ramen skip the rolls and fish .
okay so i have nothing new to say here about their food that hasnt been said before yes it is very good however avoid the 3 hour wait and go on a weekday .
the sushi is terrible on par with supermarket sushi .
the blueberry pancakes are soo good it so fluffy and its not sweet pretty yum its pretty hard to find a good pancake on the west coast all the other breakfast items were pretty good pretty standard .
hype a line like a club to eat here at 2 am please go eat street food like regular new yorkers .
amazing we had the brioche french toast eggs benedict and huevos rancheros all great their scones look delicious must try that next time going on a weekday morning the line wasnt so bad .
horrible service as a former new yorker disappointed to see how this place has gone down hill .
mjs star 3 5 price southern breakfast 14 pancakes 13 except tip tax .
food only good in pictures we had mac n cheese and burger and chicken pillared all was less than ok .
i was too late to make it to brunch however i went back for dinner and got the wild maine blueberry pancakes and based on this i am eager to back for brunch btw they do deliver .
host was incredibly rude we arrived early and were not seated in the order we arrived completely insulted never going there again .
be prepared to wait but this restaurant lives up to the hype of all the awards it has won blueberry pancakes try them and youll thank me later .
had the truffle scrambled eggs guess i should have went for the mac attack everyones raving about somewhat of a scrambledeggssnob and it was below average really bread wasnt the best small side salad and bland eggs defs not coming back here for eggs .
sugarcured bacon maple butter blueberry pancakes 1 5 hour wait is worth every minute nuff said .
not letting 8 ppl in on a saturday is unheard of not sure who runs this place but thats disgusting and this place should really consider new bodyguards and staff peace cafeteria you lost 8 customers .
this place is really good .
what a joke this place is full of excuses bad service ended up eating across the street bc this place had every excuse as to why they couldnt sit my party .
is the brunch wellprepared and tasty yes will the memory of delicous scones linger on for a few days absolutely is this nice spot worth insane waiting times on weekends absolutely not there are plenty of other nice brunch places around go here on a weekday .
wont be coming back took an hour for our food to come out then it came out burnt food had no seasoning to it both salmon and chicken were dry and distasteful waiter also never cleared off the table .
amazing everything french toast with the sugar glazed bananas is out of this world .
great recovery by management to get our order and take care of us but when i complained about waiting an hour for our order the waitress said relax its just food i better never see her again .
go yes everything youve heard is true the blueberry pancakes were phenomenal my cheeseburger was delicious and smoked salmon benedict was outstanding stop reading reviews and go .
refused service on my birthday because we had a party of 6 and they only accept 4 people or less seriously .
i come from the mountains and i found the best bluberry pancakes and bacon in the city do not pass this up .
food is decent and the staff is friendly enough very cool location the service is horrendous not worth the aggregation .
im a skeptic no way could the pancakes live up to their reputation im still in a food coma from 3 hours ago they do i couldnt put them down i need to go to maple butter rehab .
waited over 40 minutes for a table of 6 when the restaurant was half empty they said they dont push tables together so we ended up walking out host did not approach us once to explain what was the reason for the wait worse service ever .
put in our name for 2 at 1255 on a saturday got seated at 235 worth the wait the heavenly blueburry pancakes were delicious topped only by the maple syrupbutter concoction it was served with i cant wait to come back to try everything on the menu .
worst service ever waitress who is not knowledgable about the products on the menu a manager who knows nothing about customer satisfaction a recipe for disaster will be writing a note to the management team directly .
came here on a saturday morning and ordered the oh forget it its good go .
terrible never come here the waitstaff is super pretentious and refused our group even though there were multiple open tables at 11pm .
pro i was actually surprised that the good was pretty good the 10 monday burger special looks good too .
place says theyre 24 hours but they turn people away at 6 am on a sat morning with plenty of open tables so they can clean pretty whack if you ask me .
really awesome breakfast here the only problem is that the wait is so long we must have waited 1 5 hours but it was worth it .
1 green eggs ham 13 00 1 salmon benedict 13 00 1 steak and eggs 13 00 1 veggie burger wavocado 13 00 we shared between four people nothing was really notable .
very good pancakes and coffee .
ordered the mac attack a bit more soggygreasy than usual but tasted ok 30 mins after in severe pain of diarrhea as im typing this .
hands down best pancakes ive ever had probably has something to do with using cake flour and lots of butter but who cares great coffee too .
the service was terrible the biscuits and gravy were wonderful the truffle fries were delicious too if i happened to be in chelsea id give it another try .
fattest fluffiest flavorfulest blueberry pancakes ive ever had clinton st bakery was worth all the hype and the 40 minute wait for a table at 2pm on a rainy friday afternoon who the hell were all those other people .
food was mediocre can i have some real syrup please bathrooms too small dont ask me where i want to sit if you are going to turn the inside into the outside it did not match the hype .
the burger and beer deal is excellent beware that the service can be a bit slow .
used to look forward to coming to this place but now i plan to avoid it until they make some serious improvements food took forever at a nonbusy time it was cold not what we ordered and not good when it finally arrived .
on a cold rainy sunday i waited for about an hour with my friends beneath an awning to eat here and it was worth it .
i always come here but one night the dude at the door was acting funnystyle when it comes to letting black people in we gotta eat too never coming to this place again .
ive never been for the sacred brunch choosing instead to skip the line and pop in for dinner on occasion i like the clean friendly atmosphere and the delicious home cookedstyle food .
just so so burger wasnt very good meat was salty bun was very dry mac and cheese was overrated .
this is a great spot for diner food thats made well everything ive had so far tasted great and was of high quality expect a wait though and they only take cash which i find increasingly frustrating nowadays .
terrible terrible service the place only services based on it historical reference of the show sex in the city food is neutral in taste and service is inconsistent .
dreamy pancakes .
granted last time i was here was in 2005 but if its still anything like it was its run by a bunch of douche bags i will never return .
its been over a year since coming to the clinton st baking company but i still think about their maple browned butter you could seriously spread that shit on a dirty mop and it would taste delicious .
i tried to eat there and found out the do not serve black people on dr martin luther kings birthday wow so so shocked i plan to let the world know .
blueberry pancakes worth waiting a looong time for .
pretentious and overrated in new york city there exists an abundance of great restaurants that treat their patrons with respect and class this place is a joke why anyone would waste their time and money with this venues rude staff and less than adequate food is beyond me .
this is breakfast at its best everything here tastes fresh and yummy really comforting love the brunch but hate the wait but it is a small place and the waiters are always very nice try the milkshake if you havent they are creamy and heavy and great .
beers are warm the bartender is super rude and guess what food is mediocre i regret to be here .
god i miss this place one of few places where waiting for 40 minutes is worth every second this is no hype no gimmick pancakes here are truly out of this world how can they be soooo friggin good a gem of a restaurant .
food is mediocre when my friends and i got our food it was lukewarmroom temperature waffle soggy fries room temperature ill live if i dont ever come back 18 service charge for 3 people not worth it .
fresh raspberry jam smothered on tasty biscuit brunch menu is deep .
this place was very mediocre very disappointed after seeing all of the positive reviews .
the breakfastbased food is excellent also i hate beets but love their beets salad whatever you do do not order the fried chicken .
went for brunch yesterday the french toast was subpar and for 13 was disappointing the service however was great fast and the wait on a saturday at 12pm was only 30 minutes .
best breakfast place ive ever been to great overall and excellent pancakes the 1hr 30 wait was a bit ridiculous or id give it 5 stars .
ok food awful service not worth the price .
the pancakes are to die for extra syrup plz .
good food shady service if staff feel youre not paying attention or have had too much to drink they will grat your check without telling you .
a nice small restaurant good for breakfast service was good food arrived fresh quick and for the most part was pretty tasty the portions are generous as well price good presentation good taste good recommend banana walnut pancakes .
tasty food crappy service .
be patient the reward is delicious also bring cash because they do not take credit cards .
very rude service the guy outside made us wait for more that 20 minutes at 3am in the morning the food is great but not worth it being treated like this .
the food was really well prepared the atmosphere is casual very low lighting at night so a nice place to take a date the staff were friendly and attentive i would definitely eat here again .
to the manager of cafeteria the two women working the hostess stand on the evening of june 29 were offensive and incompetent i will never return to your establishment due to their attitude and behavior shame on all of you .
well executed comfort food with unique touches that make it a little special fried green tomatoes with jalapeo sour cream were amazing .
hungry and needed to find a spot quick very crowded popular spot service was slow and food was okay they serve burgers and salads all a bit overpriced if you ask me prob would not go back there .
good homey little place for some hearty breakfast .
wow quite dissapointing sandwich was dry over cooked vegeatble werent good quality could have gotten same or better quality at one of those kiosks on the street service is quite dis interested .
friendly staff cute place pancakes of the day pear and apple compote with a maple butter syrup were fluffy perfectness .
its sad to see the quality of the food and the attentiveness of the waiters go downhill i use to love this place but it seems like cafeteria is too cool and trendy now so they started serving mediocre food in pretty plates ugh sad sad .
ive only been privy to the egg and biscuit breakfast sandwich and thats all i need 5 stars .
i used to love cafeteria and their mac cheese i dont know what happened to them they are not the same the ambiance is great though very chic and sleek .
yummmmmm we came in from sf and were dying to find good breakfast and clinton st baking company didnt disappoint the wait wasnt too crazy besides we went across the street for a nice coffee at cocoabar to pass the 30 minutes .
been here on prior occasions and have enjoyed the food but this time around poor service affected the food which arrived cold and flavorless three parties who arrived after us in our section received there food ate paid and left before we received our food disappointing .
i enjoyed their brunch of course any popular small place is going to have a long line at peak hours i liked the potato pancakes and egg dishes consider the specials if they dont run out of them .
the food here is terrible almost tasteless i know ive been there in the past and it was at least average but this recent visit was awful its a scene if thats what youre looking for after a night out .
never tried brunch but the dinner was damn fine .
real bad thats all .
this place is a dream my favorites pancakes with homemade maple butter biscuits basically everything my least favorites the waits for brunch .
dont understand the hype food is not great although i do like the grilled fish tacos best thing about the restaurant is that it is open 24 hours unless i need a late night restaurant ill pass on this one .
if you like pancakes this place is an absolute must the blueberry pancakes and butter infused maple syrup yessuch a thing actually does exist are so good youd trade your favorite pair of manolos to have a bite .
service was friendly but this place is highly overrated total diner food sub par wont be back .
great pancakes .
late night eating usually means everything is awful but you love it because well shoe leather with mayo would be good because you are famished food was eh but the inattentive staff was even worse .
all i have to say is that these are the best pancakes i have ever eaten period there is nothing else that i can say that should convince you to go except dont go because i really hate the wait in line sorry kinda selfish ill admit it .
food is gross waffles were soggy and the chicken was under seasoned grilled mahi mahi sucks steak was very fatty and came with what appeared to be french toast sticks but taste like a foot best thing was the water .
forget the dang brunch ive never had to wait to be seated for dinner and in my opinion just as great .
there is no reason to wait on line for maccheese at 1230 am on a weeknight we watched other couples being let in ahead of us for 15 minutes walked away and found a diner that was interested in taking our jerks .
absolutely love their pancakes great place for brunch but theres a wait both time i went there in the week i was visiting ny its worth the wait .
food and service not as good as it used to be would not recommend at all .
egg dishes are perfectly cooked here but nothing beats the blueberry pancakes .
this place has really slipped its turned into a silly factory for sex in the city wannabes from elsewhere the food used to be rather creative but on my last visit it was actually lame a glorified applebees .
biscuit oh biscuit you are tender and flaky and cure hangovers .
this place is awful i cant believe it is so popular and busy all the time is it just because of sex and the city i really dont get it the food is terrible stay away .
the best brunch in town hands down what dont i love about this place oh yeah the sometimes impossible wait still though the buttermilk biscuit sandwich the brioche french toast the blueberry pancakes the vidalia onion rings theyre all amazing .
meh completely describes this place mac cheese rather boring doesnt compare to delicious ones ive had at other new american comfort food places california cobb salad forgettable and therefore overpriced service lackluster and confused apparently the sliders were dry as was my chicken so very unimpressed .
theyve got a banging square slice .
the food is decent but the atmosphere is a total bad vibe festival the hostess gives bad vibes the servers act like youre bothering them and even the neighboring table that is literally two inches away hates you ill never go back never .
go for the pepperoni square we tried some others but none impressed like that beautiful square slice with tiny thick cut pepperonis filled with delicious fat tiny cramped space so eat fast or get outside and eat .
meh not really worth the wait i liked the fries .
best pizza in newyork and we found it i loved it cheese ration w sauce is perfect crust is not too crunchy not too soggy it was amazing worth the looking around definitely would recommend it to anyone who wants to try the best pizza slice theyve had .
not too thrilled i had their cobb salad i could have made that myself just a lot of snobby gays everywhere im a kool gay lol its ok .
i didnt want much just a square slice of pizza to take me through to the next meal i got what i wanted obviously this place is popular with the afterwork crowd .
unimpressed ive had better seriously ill go back to williamsburg for a falafel or real diner food this place is way too pretentious for its own good .
if youre looking for pizza at 2am and youre willing to take it to go this is a pretty good place the spicy pizza is um really spicy i dont know if i could handle it again anyway this is cheesy saucy good for cheap pizza .
quality does matter and its lacking in too many areas in this has been cafeteria style over priced diner food served with way too much attitude .
such amazing pizza every time im in the neighborhood i make it a point to stop in here the broadway breadcrumb square is my favorite and i would absolutely recommend it the stuffed prosciutto balls are also very good .
well past its prime the food is sometimes decent but the service rarely so and the wait can be excruciatingly long better offhours and when you can sit outside not worth waiting in line and the host will always underestimate the wait by at least 100 .
hands down the best pizza in all of nyc everything is so fresh and you can tell the pizza was made with care i honestly have their pizza at least once a week since i work nearby the margherita is my favorite .
prob everyone in nyc has eaten here and i can safely say that this place is over rated over priced yes this place sucks always to crowded and the food is not all that great .
for what you pay the price is just right good pizza every single time best in nyc .
the worst dining experience i have ever had i wish i could give it minus stars i have never left a restaurant pissed off until now if you have no experience in the service industry but you are gay head on over to cafeteria .
this place is famous for its spicy pepperoni for a reason .
nothing major the waiter was not very friendly the food was ok i dont have much to say about this place except that i wont be going back .
the prince perfection is so delicious i want to order it all the time and when i dont its on my mind .
this place is for people who love to be treated badly by cute waiters whats that about .
balanced rich tomato sauce good fresh melty cheese and a chewy flavorful crust get the spicy spring pepperoni square its perfection and literally the only pepperoni pizza ive ever ordered voluntarily .
im with everyone else get the mac and cheese .
fantastic pizza so yummy i had the smoked mozerella and my sister had the margherita both were phenomenal .
why do people go here surely it cant be from one sex and the city reference bland generic food that is about 5 to expensive per plate a la eatery .
great crust great cheese great authentic nyc pizza small place all kinds if celebrity pictures on the wall off the hook can check off my list .
the absolute worst restaurant and service i have experienced in many years period would not even give it a 1 pathetic .
i have live in this neighborhood for 45 yrs and have never tasted a better pizza i go once a week and refuse to try anything else .
wow i waited two hours for them to serve me burnt and legit moldy beef never coming back terrible service watched two waiters argue over not having to take a table served grated parm that they dropped on the floor no thanks .
they are efficient at 2230 am they were getting people through the queue quickly but when they decide to close thats it saw many disappointed people come by a few minutes later the plain cheese slice was awesome and i wasnt even drunk .
i havent been to a olive garden in years now i remember why i stopped going this place its good for one thing indigestion not real italian food everything must be frozen still as crappy as i remember .
the pizza here is amazing never had anything like it we had the spicy spring mercer margherita fancy prince and prince perfection all of them were awesome especially the mercer margherita definitely a must visit when in new york .
its faker than fake italian and not even tasty why anyone would like this is beyond me avoid .
this pizza is so good i ate too fast before taking a pic amazing little pizza joint .
i got a meatball sub and buffalo wings while hungover in bed the meatballs were a strange dry tacky texture and did not taste like meatballs the buffalo wings had basically no sauce on them and had no flavor and the chicken was dry super disappointing hangover cure .
have had pizza from here a few times catered to a couple events and once by just passing it delicious nyc pizza really into the thin crust pesto one but the sicilian slices are really what im into here love a nice hot crispy slice now and again .
why is this being spelled kim luang when their menu says kam luang i just reviewed this place under that name and now i see this listing the menu and all the yellow page listings say kam .
pizza place is very small had the pepperoni square slice the pepperoni are little minis and are delicious the staff wasnt the greatest but the pizza is very good i would get the pizza go because hardly any room to sit inside .
had the eggs benedict did not like it it was not done right the home fries were also disappointing as well .
the pizza by the slice is amazing with a light crunchy thin crust we also tried the square pizza they are famous for one of each was the perfect combo make sure to order a side or corner piece of the square pizza .
ive never been to bellas because they dont allow strollers it looks lovelyit just isnt accessible .
stopped in for a slice pretty good not great dont go out of your way .
i had heard about this restaurant a while back but thought it closed someone posted a new review so i went out of my way a little to check it out it is closed it is now phillipines cuisine i think is what the sign said bummer .
delicious grab and go slices i have only had the opportunity to stop in once so far but look forward to the next time i can grab a slice while im out and about on the town .
classic italian cuisine make this a great spot to bring that special someone the lasagna was fantastic and the chicken marsala was loaded with flavor and no one can complain about the prices especially since the portions are true italian style huge .
had a slice of the margarita and the cheese sicilian best pizza ive had in nyc so far you could tell how fresh the sauce was and the crusts were crisped to perfection definitely dont leave without trying a slice of the sicilian .
pros lakeside sunsets live music great people watching cons overpriced poorly made food and drink served by teenyboppers that couldnt give a shit whether you live or die .
the pepperoni square pizza is everything perfectly chewy crispy pepperoni sweet tomato sauce fresh mozzarella yes please give this place a shot if youre in the area the perfect after shopping meal .
the antique menu long wait times and constantly overturning juvenile staff make this beautiful club not worth joining ed the bartender is the only reason this place even deserves one star hes fantastic .
had the spicy slice and was not disappointed crispy yet robust crust great sauce .
the most average place ive ever been .
all the square pizzas were great esp the pepperoni its not a restaurant no where really to sit fine by me just an fyi .
do not eat here very plain rolls are over 10 and they are not good at all i dont think these people know how to make good sushi .
extra crispy all the time everytime .
absolutely abysmal in pretty much every way service is just terrible and the sushi is bad run dont walk away from this pathetic excuse for a restaurant i would recommend that the nyc restaurant consider just closing this location because it is destroying your brand never again .
one of the best square slices in nyc easily the best in manhattan get the spicy spring pepperoni slice phenomenal .
expensive small glass full of ice cocktail for 12 i would wait till i board on flight sushi is made of imitations service is slow drinks are weak .
real good new york pizza if you want pretense ambiance or artistically pizza on a flimsy crust go somewhere else if you want the best pesto and black olive slice youll ever have some here .
if this is sushi i am an astronaut worse sushi ever eaten and expensive bad service too .
just go in and enjoy everything great service great pizza will be going back very soon .
horrible pale flavorless sushi looks like it made by a kid for the first time miniature portion and all the sushi is falling apart .
the pizza was just amazing we tried the margarita slice and the pepperoni square the square is a must .
decent sushi foe the airport the fish was not fresh tasted prefrozen across the terminal we found a chinese place wok roll this place served excellent fresh salmon .
the best square pizza in the universe nothing could be better if i could eat only one thing the rest of my life itd be the square w pepperoni served here .
terrible store bought quality sushi with stale fish .
have to say greatest slice pizza on nyc the ingredient are of high quality and not from a can of tomato soup the sicilian pepperoni is the best slice while the margarita sicilian is not bad either would highly recommend .
i was expecting better pizza after reading the reviews kinda over priced too .
pizza is good thin crust and fresh ingredients service was fast knowledgeable and friendly overall a great place they also have a good selection of beers good beers that is .
the pizza sauce tastes worse than from a can watery like consistency toppings thrown on too much ricotta on white pizza garlic crisps were soggy flavorless leftover pieces of crust .
one of the best pizzas in nyc its not cheap though but worth it .
overpriced and mediocre the pizza was burnt on the bottom and the flavor were sub par i ordered the veggie pie and the margarita pizza 43 90 this is pizza not caviar next .
best pizza in lower manhattan no doubt plus it has the friendliest service dont waste your time going to an expensive famous place prince street is the best there is .
one word gross do not eat here .
best in the business must get the sicilian pepperoni and the vodka slice .
i order the fishchips fish were very plain no flavor im will not come back the place is clean compare to other .
excellent pizza thats all there is to say if youre craving a square pepperoni slice in the nolitasoho area this is the only place to go .
worst thing i ever ate they microwaved my biryani and mixed chilli powder in ketchup for hot sauce never going back .
delicious pizza get the spicy with habenero peppers made into the sauce and fresh cut pepperoni and a slice of their soho pizza frankie is awesome and if hes there youll know it and their cheese is homemade .
ordered delivery dinner at 711 pm food delivered at 908 medium rare burger was well done and dry fries were soggy and cold bummer .
the best pizza ive found in soho after working here for seven years square pepperoni is fantastic messy but delicious and reasonable at 3 95 .
stopped by with my cousin really bad burger so disappointed .
spicy square is the best pizza in nyc sex in your mouth if you think you know pizza and havent been here then think again .
yuck i ordered my dish without chicken and it came with chicken 15 minuets letter i got my tasteless chicken less dinner did it mention it had no flavor i will never go back even if compd i love the plate covered with lettuce though .
its a good slice of pizza and very fresh ive only had it once but if you are in the area and hungry for a good slice its better than most 2 slices .
the food was good the service not too bad or price only charge whatever they feel like .
really good i like their thicker crust cheese pizza .
i got a bacon cheeseburger platteri asked for the burger medium and it was overcookedthe beef was flavorless the fries were horriblethey looked old and like they had been frozen it ended up costing 15 total waste of money dont do it .
the pepperoni sicilian is my favorite slice in the city hands down .
cool diner mediocre and overpriced food .
my boss ordered the square pepperoni pizza for our meeting last week it was amazing went to the actual shop yesterday just as amazing great shop in a great neighborhood .
this place looks cool and retro from the outside but inside it just stinks it literally smells like a bathroom we left without ordering .
came here after a bad experience at lombardis so delicious had a slice if the margherita and it was amazing thin crispy crust yummy cheese and fresh basil love not really much space for dinein but worth the trip to grab a slice .
i had great expectations but this place turned out horrible the burgers are huge but the meat is tasteless the food is def not made with any love tasteless just like any ordinary dinner food .
love this spot and super lucky its across the street from me .
i went with my sis and family it definitely has a different kind of crowd no its not the same as the other locations but the food was good enough .
this is my favorite pizza place in the whole city the pepperoni square is by far the best thing to put in your mouth and also make sure to eat the risotto balls my goto pizza place .
the burger i had was kind of lousy the fries i had were kind of lousy the jukebox at the table did not work i will not be back .
i always appreciate everyone taking the time to give a review but please add the name of another joint if you think youve tasted better it helps me decide between places thanks .
all the food is huge at this place but unfortunately its not any good i had the burger which was very greasy and fell apart the two stars come from the friendly staff and there being a jukebox at every table .
a m a z i n g pizza the perfect slice has been found and its prince st pizza any kind you get will probably be delicious go there the neighborhood nolita is the cutest place ever only good times will be had .
not the best service didnt know if fries were gluten free or not so asked to sub potatoes plus up charged 2 plus 2 got gf roll on top of meal is pretty spendy for a burger not worth it for the money .
friggin good pizza if youre in the area theres no better place to get a slice order pay eat leave no frills just pizza molto bene .
food was good but 45 minute wait for 3 martinis was pathetic and it wasnt crowded .
its been ages since ive written a review but i need to give credit where credit is due this is some of the best delivery pizza ive had very similar to the infamous lbs square pie in brooklyn so happy to have found this place .
delivery was fast and the people that worked there were friendly some places are very rude but they werent had cheese pizza and it wasnt that great jersey can do better .
ok ok ok ok let me just say their sicilian pepperoni is the best thing ever like man that is all i can say the right amount of sauce the pepperonis are small and crunchy it seriously is one of my favorite .
went to arlington pizza with my fiance who was craving pizza the pizza was an oily mess my neighborhood pizza in bedstuy brooklyn is 10 times better .
one of my favorite slices around their signature slice is the square pepperoni and it is amazing plain is great too .
arlington pizza used to be amazing and i used to recommend the place now the original owner sold it and many things have not been the same such as their pizza and penne and vodka those where my favorites not so much the same .
great and cheap pizza cheap for the area the sauce really makes these pizzas great the sauce has a zesty sweetness to it def one of my top 3 pizza places in sohonolita .
i get the sense that customers are a bother rather than something that should be embraced the food is good but if everyday is a bad day they should sell the business and find another line of work maybe post office or dmv .
amazing square pizza best ive ever had tomato sauce is sooooo delicious wish i lived closer so i could visit this place regularly .
greeted with warm and inviting service the food was just a let down if you dont mind rubbery omelettes and mushrooms dry and crumbly burgers then perhaps youll enjoy this place .
best slice of pizza in nyc in my opinion im here every weekend .
went for brunch food was average service was terrible coffee was atrocious .
pretty pretty pretty good excellent crust and pretty good tomato sauce you cant go wrong getting a slice at this pizza place .
we ordered sashimi very old nasty fish neither my partner nor i finished our meal it was that bad and then i was sick for a day afterward the place wasnt crowded but our service was very very slow .
came back a year later and it was just the same as i remembered delicious .
i tried to give this place a few chances its local so i thought i would give it a chance but its the same every time the food mediocre to poor prices are high and service is spotty we stopped going for these reasons .
the best place for thin crust in new york city .
the prices you find in the dinner menu are all outdated fake the average entree price is about 5 00 more than it is listed here be aware of this clip joint entrees are rather skimpy and way overpriced avoid this joint by all means .
amazing slices my favorite being the pepperoni square the pepperoni is as good as it gets burnt around the edges crispy dough is crunchy and light basically heaven on earth this place is a no brainer 45 star .
sooooo bad i keep hoping the food will get better and it keeps getting worse i literally threw out half the take out order i just brought home two forkfuls of the sauteed calimari and it was in the trash hope is now lost .
best pizza ive had in this area so far its expensive but the pizzas are huge definitely will be ordering from them again .
how can you possibly screw up a chicken parm thats all i have to say about this terrible restaurant i live around the corner from the place and id rather drive 20 minutes further for a decent meal .
good taste and so so cheap reasonable .
completely overpriced food rather small portions and not such great taste only when the older lady is there the food is better .
delicious no bs just great pizza and nice people had the pepperoni squares a little kick to the sauce which was nice oh and they have coke products not pepsi thank goodness .
i was so excited to try this place sadly i was very disappointed the food was overpriced and portions too small aside from that the oxtail was tasteless and cabbage not what was expected will never go back .
solid 4 stars probably one of the best pizzas ive had since i moved back to ny you can find allot pizza joints but few that make you wanna go back ill be bac my inner fat kid demands it .
tea manakeesh and baklawa are good however any thing els is not shawrma falafel konafa ect non of these tastes as goog as it should the fisrt time i ate there i thought god im gonna miss home if all resturants are this way .
got the cheese pizza and neapolitan rice balls both were superb .
cant comment on the rest of the dishes but the baklava at the makkah market was both better and bigger for the same price maybe i will visit on 2 tuesdays for smoothies .
great food here loved the rice balls .
i was craving a chicken tawook wrap from saads they were closed decided to go to this establishment and saw something similar on the menu it was definitely not what i expected i did not like it at all it was nothing like saads .
my daughter and i are visiting form dallas this is an excellent value and a true neighborhood gem lunch for less than 10 and in true ny style know what the hell youre ordering before you step into line .
i dont really see the hype in this place i went for a waffle one morning and it had a weird uncooked consistency not sure if the waffle wasnt fully cooked or if it was some vegan gluten free contraption but i was unable to finish it .
pie is fantastic especially the margherita .
we had the chicken tawook and hummus both were nicely presented but bland the spinach pie was adorable and tasty im not sure if its just what we ordered but we werent impressed with the food the restaurant itself is beautiful .
best thick square pizza in nycspicy pepperoni and sweetsaltytangy tomato sauce doesnt get better than this .
sorry folks all i can say is hair in the pizza .
you know that pizza place people outside of nyc ask for the one where they want a small shop with an italian guy behind the counter and a fast quick tasty bite that completely represents ny pizza this would be that place .
terrible wife bought two sandwiches subway is better one slice of turkey and one slice of cheese on lousy rolls never going back jason b .
theres about 100thousand pizza places around this one is great open late the cheese is great and they use lots of it i wish their dough was a little thicker .
pizza sucks real bad also we ordered stuffed mozzarella bread but it wasnt bread some kind of doughy crust real bad also sucks that i live across the road w a horrible delivery option .
fast and friendly .
hard to get a good read on this place at first i felt the pizza was good unfortunately the last time i visited the pizza was lacking and the chicken roll was cold nothing really makes this pizzeria stand out above the others in the area .
a good representation of ny style pizza good sauce .
its very close to my building but i stopped coming after a few times cause the crowd was just too much and it took them 20 to make my to go latte its just not worth it .
for a slice place this is about as good as it gets i recommend the pepperoni sicilian slice its a touch pricier than your typical slice but well worth it .
food and coffee are great however the unorganized chaos inside gets old and the staff isnt great theyre slow not nice and they are unsanitary i saw one of the employees eating over a food preparation area then didnt wash her hands after .
the pizza is very tasty the grandmas with garlic is the best .
ok coffee what coffee shop in nyc doesnt have skim milk or wifi though had the avo toast which was nice .
good food great location will go back .
coffee was ok chai latte was horrible service was extremely slow the place does look great though plenty of better options in the area id rather go to .
best pizza ive had in nyc and at 4 a slice .
employees really nice food was good but loud music while eating and not being able to hear the people sitting at our table makes me not want to go back will not recommend to friends .
rays has highquality by the slice try bolognese .
will never understand how this place has such high ratings the sushi totally sucks they dont cut the fish properly so you may end up with a bite full of skin nasty .
best old fashioned pizza of my life this was my choice dinner for valentines day as someone with expensive taste that should not be taken lightly try it for yourself .
i dont understand the high ratings the sushi quality is far below par we had shrimp tempura eel spicy tuna yellowtail and salmon roe all were very poor quality the absolute worst sushi in philly dont waste your time and money .
omg this pizza was no joke extremely amazingly delicious it is my favorite pizza in ny .
it was our first time to try vic sushi we got 6 different rolls and were very disappointed the rice was just way too wet it made all rolls tasted so weird we rather go to the whole foods market to get genji sushi bars sushi box .
great basic pizzas this is the huge new york style pizza you think of pizzas are labeled as neopolitan but are huge and delicious try the spicy peperoni calzone the melty whipped ricotta in there is amazing .
tried this place on a saturday night for take out they said 30 min i came in 30 min they said 15 more min i waited 20 they said 2 more min i waited 5 they said 2 more min i left and got pizza .
great pizza this is no 1 pizza but i like this spot their pizzas are great especially the fresh mozzarella pizzas which i highly recommend freshly made fresh out the oven and the tomato sauce is really tasty .
i orders fish today and hade food poison based on review it sound like they never tried fresh fish .
still a good pizza place that i will come back to but i am so disappointed that they changed the recipe of vodka sauce pizza just cheesy with not much vodka flavor it is no longer my favorite .
dont order delivery 1 hour late took 2 hours to get food still waiting delivery driver just called asked where i was at and i put in notes what hotel i was staying at and the correct address food will definitely be cold not acceptable .
excellent pizza here at princestreet i had the margherita slice and my boyfriend had the pepperoni both were highly satisfying the pepperoni was little and the ends curled up when cooked margherita had an excellent sauce and crust combo we will definitely be back when in the area .
the food is not fresh and the service is extremely slow i had to wait an hour to get my fish .
visited this place twice on my recent ny trip got the sicilian with pepperoni quick cheap tasty all you could ever ask for from a slice house .
tasteless and regret ordering ordered falafels n chicken kebabs nothing like what it should be hummus was awful .
amazing simply amazing love it .
the quality of the food had gone shockingly down hill not only do they now charge for delivery but the fish was clearly not fresh i will never order from here again .
easily one of the best pizza joints in the city everything is fresh made the sauce cheese and dough great service with large slices i try not to go back often and fail .
menu do very well their food generally dont recommend it plus a bit cheap not health .
best pizza ever had both sicilian and regular pies were awesome lunch for 4 for under 20bucks .
worts delivery service ever the food is great i completely understand that yesterday was raining and was busy but to wait 2 hours for a pizza to arrive was ridiculous you really need to get staff together .
this is the pizza i have been dreaming of slices available thin crust and sicilian margarita thin crust was good but should have gotten another slice of pepperoni the cheese plentiful and stringy deliciousness sauce perfect crust yep got it right .
this place must have new management now new faces and terrible food i was shocked tiny shrimp sizes and dirty veins sticking out ugh i never had this problem before this will be my last trip there .
it was good i thought the sauce was a little bland but it was good on the go .
if you get the pho and dump whole jar of spicy sauce in it you get asian comfort food 5 stars for that alone but minus three for otherwise consistently shitty food .
believe the hype this slice could change your life a must try best slice in the area and rivals lombardis for best pizza in town .
an avoidable place especially if you have a tendency to get suckered in by the cheap lunch specials the fried rice is stale and the meat leaves you uneasy almost a little queasy .
i am a pizza fanatic this is my favorite slice ive ever had in ny thicker and cheesier than the lombardis type my go to spot wish they had more assortment of sides ie garlic knots maybe pepperoni rolls .
omg i dont know if it was my selection of food that i chose but this was the worst chinese food id ever had in my life my stomach aches at the thought of it i almost had to force it down .
i can now confirm that louie from joes superette is making prosciutto balls at prince st pizza i was there today ordering a dozen prosciutto balls for takeout louie himself emerged from the kitchen to give my order to the counter guy here is louie pardonmeforasking blogsp… .
cheap but taste bad .
just took my girlfriend for her first slice of new york pizza had a cheese and a pepperoni the owner was incredibly friendly and even threw in one of their square sicilian pieces for free absolutely incredible and the kitchen was actually staffed with italians .
great appetizers mac and cheese balls beignets and pig ears were really good burger single patty was disappointing nothing special dessert smores was really bad cold also service was vvvveeerrrryyy sssssllllooowww considering it wasnt that busy our server seemed to take forever with everything except the bill .
the best pizza ive had in nyc came back the next weekend for more pepperoni squares were awesome .
this menu is not for me maybe it is for you i am a picky eatter and not very adventurous .
it is as good as aaa i dont know but what i do know is that it is much better than rays written by my 8 year old son the pepperoni pizza is delicious as well as the rice balls .
good ambiance but the food is terrible and overpriced this is similar to the owners failed swift half concept they try and put an upscale twist on traditional bar food but it just doesnt work .
fantastic on the day i went into this little place they had just brought out a fresh diablo sicilian pizza man was this thing good their pizza sauce was fresh and delicious the staff were great to talk to and were very funny .
pizza was not good at all and expensive will never return .
love it .
didnt like it all the sauces on the lamb and chicken dishes seemed watery or like they were made from jarred spices or premixed sauces just got the overall sense nothing was being prepared very freshly cant put my finger on it .
theru and ny dosas embody everything that is good about new york sweet service good conversation and personalized touches to your food are what makes this place a gem come for delicious vegan dosas return for the fact that each is crafted with compassion .
nasty food place stinks very slow service atmosphere is terrible staff was not friendly owner was a douchbag will never go there again stay away save your money .
wow the pondicherry dosa is out of this world the veggies are fresh pungent delicious for me its a nice affordable afterclass treat also the owner thiru is so fantastic and hardworking read his interview on mashable com .
spoiled bartenders that think they work at sothebys wont take tips if giving in coins and not bills or credit card disappointing .
hes super chill makes the dosa on the spot and everything is very fresh grab a dosa and chill in the park i would recommend the pondicherry .
beer prices have gone up quite a bit too loud no more art the bartenders dont get to you fast enough as they are busy talking to their friends .
i went to ny dosas for the first time today and will definitely be coming back the samosas are great and so is the service no waiting in line for appetisers or drinks quick yummy inexpensive and pleasant .
i came here last night after dinner in the neighborhood looking for a chill place to get one more drink i ended up leaving with full drinks on the table the bartender was downright rude and the beverage selection was mediocre i would skip this place .
best food in nyc ever i am an indian and the samosas and the dosas are better than anything i have had in india thiru dosas rock complete value for money .
im all for good date bars but this place is too loud music wise too dark and not cozy enough seatings also its wine and beers only .
worth the wait .
went at about midnight on a saturday night tiny packed and incredibly loud walked right out in order to save my ears from permanent damage go if youre a 21 year old nyu student .
the samosa filling is so good but its the dough that takes it to another level he is going to be busy for the unforeseeable future .
not pretentious although it seems tempted it is a cool space but really dark and usually really loud the bartender jams the music and it echoes around and you cant talk .
incredible samosas quick and easy spot to pick up them up and enjoy in the park .
i used to frequent this bar often until i had a bad experience when i brought some friends we were having a great time until the bartender gave us attitude and urged us to leave they also refused to play hootie the blowfish .
if i lived in the neighborhood i would eat here everyday so delicious and nice to take your plate and eat on the grass guy running the operation is awesome i love this place .
probably the worst bar ive been to in philly boring it was hotter inside than outside in the summer the waitress said that she didnt know if the ac worked .
had the delicious pondicherry dosa incredibly filling light spicy at my request and came with an awesome semithick chutney the guy running the stand is attentive incredibly nice calm and a great businessman .
bartenders are ok but i ordered there signature salad and it was sandy ouch the food used to be good here but .
i only had samosa and drumstick for snack they tasted alright but i sure will order from the lunch menu next time .
this place used to be a lot of fun but the service is so cold the bartenders act like they are high and mighty there are so many better places to go in the neighborhood .
the best with the demise of spice row e 6th st so hard to find a good dosa if up for lunch in the park this is the place to go .
its awfully expensive for a dive bar .
mmm mm good .
the bathrooms are dank the characters ive met here were beyond seedy i have bad memories of this place bad bad memories also they should really start checking ids .
amazing value the flavor and price cant be beat the only downside is when there is a line the dosa gets made a bit sloppy so that the crepe is thicker than usual and the filing is anemic .
the food was just ok the ambiance and decor was nice but i am foodie i had to make reservations a month in advance so i had high expectations i have to say that i was disappointed .
a washington square staple and some of the best food indian vegan whatever youll ever have no trans fat no dairy spiced perfect the line can get long but its always worth it look for the crowd .
i dont really understand such the hype over this place my service was beyond sub bar and the waiter seemed to be annoyed which was rude the food was nothing special and definitely not worth the money spent on it .
thiru and his dosas and samosas are one of my favorite gotos in the village its incredibly delicious and reasonably priced for lunch 3 is my favorite make sure to check his twitter before heading over there in case he cant get to the square for some reason .
gets extremely busy 2 5 stars maybe i ordered the wrong food crab meat over burnt bread it was ok wasnt good how does one burn bread a little pricey too not sure ill go back service was decent .
i love the dosa guy everything is vegan and gluten free i work and have worked down the street for quite some time and i doubt tat ill ever become tired of his food everything is very reasonably priced and is made fresh .
its okay the food and the atmosphere are just okay .
i love this place the masala dosa is perfect and he is the nicest guy sometimes when its cold he gives out hot soup while you white for the order amazing food you have to try it .
tiny food extremely tiny food and the taste is soso dont worth the money .
believe the hype extraordinarily fresh ingredients came down from midtown with a friend from chennai and gr8 loved the food as well .
been a few times the food was just okay not a good value very overrated .
love it thiru is great the food is always superb you cant go wrong with a roti curry sooo good or get the popular pondicherry portions are large but if you have space the samosas are also yummy .
service was lousy took too long to get our tea food was not all that great they forgot the pistachios in the waldorf salad and the lentil soup was way too salty my mom and i were disappointed overall with our experience .
everything is vegan or vegetarian and so affordable extremely friendly guy who can remember everyones orders in his head amazing samosas amazing savory crepes always on the southwest corner of washington square park follow his twitter to see when hes open nydosas cash only .
noisy reservation is a must the staff was helpful and pleasant when they told us it would be 2 hour wait for a table that was fine because the noise level was too high .
simple tasty vegetarian cheap a winner in my book only issue is its bit messy to eat really need to use both hands for this one .
the place is very pretty food though is so so very small portion we ended up eatting some where else again .
not only is the food outstanding and very reasonably priced but the man making it is an absolute gem he exudes kindness although i no longer live in the area i plan to go to ny dosas every chance i get both for the food and the friendship .
abc used to be so good i dont what happened since november 2012 it keeps getting worse i will not be going there anymore last 4 visits should have made that clear to me but it just used to be so good i kept going back .
lets get this straight thiru has some great dosas and samosas check his twitter to see if hes here today .
meh dont botherall hype the setting is gaudy the service is mediocre and most importantly the food is uninspired and without much flavor really disappointing especially for whats supposed to be a great farmtotable spot .
yum great to take into washington square park on a sunny day fresh vegetables extremely good sauce for dipping the dosas and delicious samosas i will definitely return .
nice decor overpriced okay food inconsistent service never again .
attention all vegetarians its time to head down to washington sq park for some good old dosa from the dosa man the dosa man won best food cart from the vendy awards its simple a lentl bean crepe with potatoe or vegetables yummy long live the dosa man .
beautiful beautiful place awful awful food .
the best dosas ive had in nyc just the right level of spiciness with a great soup and coconut chutney on the side complemented by a very friendly and courteous ownerchef and great prices overall great .
the food was ok and the service was poor slow incorrect and the server seemed impatient and defensive all in all not such a good experience i dont think i would return .
not only are these dosas out of this world and all vegan but they are cheap ive only had the dosas and they are consistently wonderful every time .
the decor here is really nice our waitress must have been new because she seemed a little out of it the brunch wasnt very good omelet but the salad was nice .
the best dosas around .
emperors new clothes huge amounts of ecofriendly farmtotable locavore nonsense but not particularly brilliant food i mean the food is fine fine not amazing by any means dont believe the hype .
authentic taste inexpensive sizeable portions and friendly guy behind the cart .
i really wasnt impressed by this place and everyone else seems to be i just think that there are far better places in manhattan to get a good meal the menu was rather boring and most of the food had no taste also the cocktails werent that special .
love it so good and so cheap too they could charge a lot more if they wanted to .
what can i say very ok great location and decor though ok i ran out of nice things to say bye .
awesome south indian food at low prices lines can be long and he thiru has very limited hours but its worth a visit .
pass on the appetizer mozzarella and heirloom tomatoes tastes like something youd pick up at a grocery store 4 totally bland balls of cheese tomatoes in lots of vinegar sugar snap pea salad also was not notable mostly hunks of lettuce with the bitter ends .
yummy dosas i love south indian food the samosas arent bad either .
run by unfriendly people with a chip on their shoulder .
great dosas and great coconut chutney .
its super unfortunate they never deliver the correct order nonetheless arrive within the specified time frame unless youre going to pick up stay away thats is of course is you dont mind waiting an hour plus .
interesting choice of lunch around nyu always a line during lunch times im more of a carnivore but i appreciated the food the dosa man is really friendly too if youre hesitant about the place give it a try .
wings were good but the pulled pork sandwich came on a hero with overpowering white onions and the quality of meat wasnt good i had to keep spitting out bad pieces and ended up just throwing it out i dont recommend the honey bbq sauce too .
our best dining experience in new york well worth the wait in line we met some super cool people and enjoyed great food service .
deceiving everything looked good and then i tasted it i got a dry burger disco fries with lumpy gravy and flavorless onion rings and zucchini sticks never again .
i enjoyed the flavors in the food but what really got me was the crepe like bread that comes with the food its so thin and crispy i would consider searching for this guy again next time im up there .
food was okay though chicken satay was pretty overcooked service was pretty bad waitress couldnt be bothered to explain anything .
tasty tasty dosas ive had this a few times and its super tasty masala dosa thin crepe with spiced potatos inside super tasty all the dosas are served with a small side of sambaar spiced soupstew samosas are also delicious here .
worst service ever .
i cant remember a time where 5 has gotten me so much delicious food it gets you a huge masala dala coconut chutney and a soup i wouldnt bother with the samosas not as special but still fine the winners here are the dalas just do it .
definition of pretentious the hostess was a stupid snob put me out there are so many better places to eat where the staff will at least pretend to be nice .
best dosas in city always a line but so worth it happy to sit and eat every last bite in the park .
the service was bad the baked eggs after reading so many decent to great reviews was disappointing it was dry and relatively flavorless the atmosphere is cute and very euroish the coffee lattes was good but not great i wasnt impressed i wouldnt likely go back .
gotta give him the props for making some very delicious dosas in a cart i didnt get to try the masala dosa or the simosas but i will definitely try them next time then i might up the rating to 5 stars .
terrible service one of the rudest hostesses ive come across in this city the food is not good enough to tolerate the nuisance .
five dollar healthy deliciousness do yourself a favor and try it .
staff got to go manager was rude hostess even more yeah its a pretty place food is tasty loved the avocado over bread and the cous cous was pretty good but they really need to have a better customer service .
delicious read the reviews and had to search for the cart totally worth it thiru was so personable and even gave us a sample of something differerent to try cant wait to go back worth the effort to find him .
dickheads .
fantastic and lovely energy .
not the place it used to be a decade ago it used to be a blackbook mecca now that crowds hauting williamsburg their couscous is still good though .
i love dosas a lot any place that serves me dosas automatically earns 5 stars in addition to my masala dosa i got an orange barley soda thiru called it a very special soda and that made me feel very special indeed .
they have some good food but generally i feel trapped in a bad issue of wallpaper magazine circa 1997 whatevs .
quite greasy and heavy but its from a street cart right delicious and spicy theres always a line eat yours in the park on a nice afternoon .
decent food fine atmosphere but bitchiest rudest laziest hostess ive ever experienced shes was the absolute worst and thusly i will not be back .
i had the dosa it was cheap and good value for money will be trying the jaffna curry next .
was going to eat here but the service was so bad i walked at least pretend to like your job .
yum delicious and cheap great for a quick lunch around nyu i ordered the masala dosa which was huge but tasty i would definitely try some of the other items yay for food carts l .
great location and a really nice outdoor seating area when the weather is nice but the food is bland and i guess because its served outdoors it comes out on paper plates and plastic cups .
nothing to be said that hasnt already been said amazing dosasamosa great prices thiru is the man tip follow him on twitter nydosas hell tell when hes coming to the park and when hes not .
worst place in vermont stank and filled with assholes never go here youve been warned .
fantastic theres not much to say that isnt in the other reviews this is the right place to go if you want a huge delicious healthy lunch for under 6 to eat in the park i recommend the samosa .
location location location actually if youve had the pizza and like it which i do its consistent otherwise the food is filling and the beer is beer the seating on the marketplace is top notch and that is the primary reason to go to kens .
finally made it here i had the pondicherry special sooooooo yummy i could barely finish it was so filling i work dangerously close to thirus magical goodness .
horrendous service and below average food steer clear protect ur neck .
oh dosa man there is simply no street food anywhere in the city more flavorful than yours thats really all that needs to be said thank you for being across the street from my school .
worst pizza in burlington possibly i think the pizza place at the mall that sells the shitty slices is better .
samosa and dosas are about as good as youll get anywhere else in the city plus its cheap and the guy who runs the cart is super nice .
pizza was fresh and good but if you are visitng from out of town i would say to skip it its nothing special if you just want to sit and watch a game and have some beer then this may be your place .
i pretty much tried all the dosas sadha dosa special masala dosa plain uttappam spl veg uttappam at this cart but liked only pondicherry dosa samosas are ok but while waiting for dosa can grab one .
we were told 20 min wait time got to sit after 40 mins ordered beer took 20 mins to arrive i cant imagine when my food will arrive a very poorly managed restaurant .
these dosas are super scrumptious n y dosa yummy and very authentic .
lovely server nothing remarkable it felt like another chain restaurant two stars are for the decor .
yes very good the dosa pancake is fantastic as is the chutney .
well getting worst wecarecstill waiting as additional two are seated once more preferential treatment to others not older couple .
long live the vegan dosas cart guy .
the servers are very nice which is the only reason this even gets 2 stars otherwise the food is so far from authentic chinese food and is so very salty if you are asian or used to eating chinese food do not come here you will be offended .
pretty dang good dosas crispy and soft warm you get lots of great sauces on the side amazing deal for the cheap price fyi we got the soup and it was reeeeeally really spicy and i have a fairly high tolerance .
we had a big order for pick up consisting of more than 10 entrees and i picked it up around 11am the food was not fresh as if they were leftovers i would prefer to eat at panda express and pay the same amount i paid here .
i miss the dosa sooooo much and the coconut chutney so good .
dont get the special limited availability pad thai it was horrible i mean foul the hot and sour soup was salt soup no heat no sour awful restaurant .
yes you want to go here .
recent glaring inconsistencies in the information provided by employees regarding available vegan options at p f changs has caused me to question their commitment to abiding by dietary restrictions i urge all diners to check with their server manager and even corporate before consuming anything questionable .
was in town last month for cmj with my band this cart was right in front of the building where all the panels were it was awesome i wish i tried more dishes but i at least got the dosa and it was delish .
only white people who dont know anything about real chinese food would go to this restaurant and call it good .
thiru my man you the best best best everything samosas roti coconut chutney ask for his specials order ahead give tips dont get scared by stan his occasional helper if you like spice ask for it youll get it .
ok food very few good dishes great ambiance but not worth the crazy long wait so hate it avoid going here at all cost .
finger licking good you might have to wait awhile but its worth it ive seen the line grow to about 20 people but the dosa man handles it with great charm .
hold up wait a minute can someone please put some cuban in it this was a waste of a friday night overpriced diner food soda pop mojitos good thing was i saw someone i havent seen in a while .
waited too long confusing ordering system no line for samosas 40 different kinds of drinks .
my red snapper was dry the waiter was over imposing and disappeared for a long period the prices just did not justify the overall quality of service in summary overpriced food for average food quality i was expecting better disappointed .
dosa man dosa man dosa man dosa man i love the dosa man more dosas now .
last night we has dinner there the appetizers were good but not great for the main course 2 of us ordered the blackened swordfish which was recommended by the waiter and it was dry over cooked with no taste .
fantastic cheap friendly fare the dosa mans right across the street from nyu law and is always there when i need him im no dosa expert but everything he serves is really yum .
90 for two lobster rolls and 2 sides and left starving the lobster roll was by far one of the worse i have ever had but at least the side of mushrooms were good .
indian version of vegetablestuffed crepes yuuuuuuuuummm friendly service too greeted by the dude and this very nice gorgeous lady very refreshing for an outdoor treat it doesnt get me full though thats why im inclined to order two the next time i come back .
no grilled fish hmmm interesting despite the name the seared grouper was okay a bit undercooked served on a bed of carrots and another veggie which were good the service was excellent good spot for a business lunch just no grilled fish .
food is worth it every bite and its very reasonably priced highly recommend it to anyone .
walked in today at 3pm seated by an uninterested waiter and ignored walked out and took my business to a place that knows how to treat a customer .
go dosa man i decided against a long elaborate review this place is an nyu community staple and rightfully so cheap and tasty indian why only 4 stars because the dosa man likes to play with my emotions and not show up on certain days .
engh no meat options so i was disappointed sara was totally cool with it food was pretty good .
cheap and good thiru is a great guy to boot .
this places stinks literally i would not even walk past this area with my dog idid not find the place to be sanitary at all ewh .
thiru the dosa man is the man winters a good time to go because the lines are shorter too .
we had pani puri and samosa chaat it was bad and got loose motion all 4 of us .
i adore the man behind the vendor almost as much as i adore the man behind the hot dog stand on chambers vegan has never been so good the price here is unbeatable .
not a fan most of the food is microwaved to order i ordered a chicken pepperoni only to watch day old dried out chicken put on a sub with pepperoni and then microwaved use an oven or toaster please .
lovedlove it great place .
the chicken and waffles were great my friend got the cheese burger and fries the fries were soggy and the burger was a frozen patty which is unforgivable .
love this place always on point with the food .
this was no good had shrimp parm and a salad neither were any good tried my wifes chicken parm not bad but not great take a pass .
super loved it sushi was top notch a few dishes werent great but thats rare huge selection and most superb .
rude staff horrible service and mediocre food plain pie tasted like cardboard pasta overdone prices way too high for quality of food served wont be back .
lots and lots of betterthanaverage food at a pretty good price the decor is kind of lame and the place gets loud but there is something for everyone here .
i went here has horrible service never saw my original server i had 4 different ones and the calzones are premade what premade food okay thats it for me .
service was a little inattentive the night we went a saturday but the excellent food made up for it great for meat eaters and vegetarians alike .
place had gone down hill entrees are frozen heated up in microwave i have had half frozen dinners used to stop in than shop walmart no more .
awesome vintage beer lights are cool as well staff was super nice .
use to be good quality and taste have suffered recently wont be back .
delicious food and chill atmosphere po boys were delicious will definitely be back when i find myself in philadelphia again .
a buffet advertised until 11pm and at 945 theres no buffet something not right about that why advertise and not deliver severely disappointed .
best pulled pork in philly and fantastic mac cheese service at the bar is much quicker compared to seating area good beer list .
heads up there was a huge chunk of meat in my vegetarian chili also i ordered a side of guacamole and the serving was super tiny .
was there on 1016 with my brother and i gotta say the bartenders were better than usual very professional and efficiently attentive food and music were great as usual a good time was had by all .
if you want to be treated poorly by the staff and then be writhing in pain all night and vomiting because you have food poisoning then burrito box is the place for you stay far away .
perfect place for amazing beer selection delicious food with a creative flair relaxed vibe with good music friendly atmosphere staff and clientele alike and enough history to peak the interest of the out of towner awesome place .
horrible food is okay but the customer service sucks guy on the phone was rude and its not worth the hassle .
positives mac and cheese pulled pork po boy sandwich biscuit mashed potato beer selection nice server portion size negatives loud fried tomatoes overall go for bbq and value .
i want to like this place they have a lot of great vegetarian options they do make you pay extra for guacamole and i did but there was so little of it easily less than a teaspoon in the whole burrito thats unacceptable burrito box unacceptable theonion comarticlesin… .
the wings the wings are so good they grill them which is different from most places but they are delicious the atmosphere is cool the beer selection is great and the service was awesome will definitely be returning .
from the perspective of a visitor from california this place was disappointing the tacos were actually small burritos wrapped in flour tortillas and they were kind of bland .
the barbecue is unbelievably awesome the bark on the brisket is intense but meat is still super tender and the pulled pork is equally as rad and order what ever frozen drink is in the machine tastiest way to blackout around .
this place wasnt that great i dont know why people are so interested in it everyone is like lets get mexican we were farting all night long im not going back .
got into philly late and needed a late dinner this place totally hit the spot great selection of beers and their bbq menu is great the bbq items are legit i thoroughly enjoyed my ribs and chicken which were bbqed to perfection .
im from california so no just no the burrito was i just cant if dennys made a burrito ill stop right there i mean if your from nyc youll probably love this place dont let me stop you .
i absolutely love khyber lowkey atmosphere reasonable prices and fabulous food their pulled pork sandwich is amazing they also make a mean cocktail would absolutely recommend it and cant wait to go back .
wayyy overrated if youre looking for authentic mexican food this is not the place their burritoes are huge but consist of mostly rice and beans i ordered the steak burrito and the meat was so chewy it was almost inedible .
had a wonderful lunch of fried green tomatoes and vegan barq excellent nice beer selection and great vibe staff was super friendly and attentive the tunes were easy on the ears definitely will go back .
shocked at all of the good reviews because the burrito here is really lacking the steak in my burrito was chewy and lacking in seasoning the amount of sour cream was criminal and they charge close to 10 wont be back .
awesome food great vegan selections im not great service great beer list .
the food is bland and overpriced and its always too packed during lunch two stars for vegan options though .
awesome find great beer pulled pork sandwich was delicious oh and jaws was playing on the tv so how could this not be an amazing bar .
seriously 47 minutes to deliver food and youve halved the portions of the quesadilla but charge the same now i cant split my lunch with my coworker bc its too little food boo to you burrito box .
you would never guess from the outside this place had some of the most legit bbq and southern cooking highlights are brunch grilled wings collards half chicken and a thoughtful draft selection .
an economical burrito but not the most flavorful decent lunch spot still not the greatest burrito ive ever had though .
awesome neighborhood dive serving grub till 1 am we love that only thing is the bathrooms are in an odd spot other then that this places rocks and plays great music too .
ill get zero star to their sanitation there were two huge flies flying around the counter and stood on the milk bottles for a few minutes i dont think ill ever get coffee there even it tastes good .
their beer selection is excellent and their food was suprisingly good considering the appearance as more of a bar than a restaurant bartenders were very knowledgable and friendly i didnt see scott bisceblie there so i know the place was cool .
i stopped by for a cappuccino because the cafe where i barista uses the same counter culture beans and its good stuff unfortunately the espresso in my drink tasted overextracted and the whole thing was very meh cool looking space though .
great vegan pulled pork is really good po boys are good specials are good never been here by myself but this seem like a good place for it my friends from new orleans said the food here is pretty closeworth coming to if youre veg for sure .
disappointing from service to food soggy pizza and expected much more from 15 burger wont go back .
great beer list great staff and some damn fine food pulled pork nachos that is all folks .
highly overrated and overpriced restaurant with rude servers late service and cold dishes the dishes are creative but highly overpriced and a 20 mandatory gratuity on restaurant com coupons ensures that servers dont care two hoots about the patrons at 50 per person approximate charge you expect better .
fried oysters made my tummy smile fried green tomatoes were good but could have been cooked a little longer and enough boudin balls to share with three people i wish i had found this pub sooner .
used to like this place left a glowing review now delivery arrives cold and the drivers start yelling at you when they get lost guess im going back to midori .
an old city hidden gem great po boys shrimp and oysters is my fave and great burgers as well the macaroni side dish here is out of this world .
after going here over 10 times and spending over 50 each time the owner chose not to honor a free appetizer at lunch time because it was valentines day for a big 5 bucks he has lost my business for good .
khyber def has its own character i like the atmosphere draft beer and the kitchen is open till 1am hehe .
tried to go here for my birthday and it was closed we came within posted hours and the open sign and lights were still on they just had the doors locked huge bummer .
as far as pubs go in philly this has to be one of the best a great tap list fantastic food and one of the best eclectic background music ive yet to hear in a pub .
the deliver boy cant find the address and blame on the orderer i dont think this is a reasonable excuse to say shit in front of the orderer maybe you guys should rethink who you guys should trust to deliver .
fantastic beer selection and great drink menu the food i would said is on par but could use a bit something they dont tend to do large groups but they accommodated at least 14 of us definitely would return .
loved this place until we got sick my colleagues and i usually eat here once a week and all three of us had food poisoning last week unfortunately we wont be eating here anymore .
i love the khyber there selection of vegan options are amazing you have to try the po boy and wash it down with as many heady beers as you can handle my favorite spot in old city if you havent been then go .
average food for the young crowd that doesnt know better tightly packed on weekends and seriously you can get this food at any respectable dinner or breakfast place anywhere no oatmeal no low calorie options almost everything is served with lots of sweets enjoy and paycash only .
went in for a drink and dessert thoroughly satisfied we each tried a different dessert and all were delicious service was great and the atmosphere is chill and homey .
apparently a restaurant which is in the business of making food was too busy to make food when 2 pregnant women ask for a takehome order after a sitdown dinner very interesting .
nice craft beer selection a great shrimp po boy and stellar mac and cheese i had a bite of my friends pulled pork sandwich and it was very good but the slaw was mayonnaise based not vinegar which was a diappointment .
horrible service we waited 30 minutes for just a coffee then waited another 45 minutes for the waitress to tell us out order was almost ready needless to say we walked out some manners need to be injected into this place asap we wont be back .
this place has been around for a very long time its a solid choice everyone should try brunch here once before they die .
service is not good servers were nice but not really concerned with 40 minute pankcakes food was mediocre .
nice beer selection good decor try their bacon popcorn .
drink order wrong multiple times in same sitting and had to wait 15 minutes in between each one waitress nor management seemed to care .
best oyster poboy ive had outside of new orleans boudin balls bacon grease popcorn onion rings are fabulous all with a great brew menu highly recommended .
update after loving cafe lift the first three times i returned yesterday morning my first weekday experience um not the same the spicy dynamic huevos ranchos i loved so much in my review cold disappointing .
one of my favorite bars in the city foods fantastic i strongly recommend everything some of my favorites include the smokey brisket chili chipolte bourbon bbq wings nachos with pulled pork and the po boy sandwiches .
their burgers are bland and do not taste great shrimp tacos were terrible the sweet potato fries were so soggy that i couldnt even eat them .
not the old khyber but still a great gastro pub in old city to grab a craft beer and some great food theyre fried chicken is awesome .
horrible service was medicore lobster roll fell apart the fried shrimp ordered by my other half was more bread then shrimp and greasy we both spent today in the bathroom world never go back .
great place for after dinner drinks similar to royal tavern im pretty sure they have the same owners huge and great beer selection and the bartenders are really attentive and nice .
these people must be getting there realtives to give these reviews this is not even close to the best burger ive ever had and the service is awfull .
beer selection is great atmosphere is very cool we enjoyed the jukebox at the bar great place for those of us who prefer a bar over a club or lounge .
food is great but the service is terrible save yourself the aggravation and order the food as takeout dont bother dining in .
best bbq and mac n cheese around ok service pretty extensive beer menu best drunk munchie meal after a night of drinking in old city oh yeahhhh .
one of the nastiest and greasiest pizzas that i ever had stay away .
i was creeped out at first to eat here but always had a great meal .
i had to change my review because unfortunately these guys have gone way downhill apparently the business was sold from italians to middle eastern folks who seem to have screwed up the recipe not going back there anymore .
food is awesome bbq brisket was great fresh horseradish is a great touch beers were awesome great place for food and beer if i lived in philly this is my regular place hands down bartender and staff are equally great at bar and tables .
pizza and mozzarella sticks were very good ordered ranch wings and mild wings both were hot enough to make our lips numb very disappointed dont know if we will order from here again .
this place is a dark hole in the wall and i love it they had a decent beer selection and pretty good service we didnt eat here at all .
diff owners and pizza makers did this just happen garlic knots tough and chewy grandpa pizza crust hard and brittle sauce definitely not as good ok pizza if you havent had the old owners pizza but not worth the drive across town anymore where did the brothers go .
bacon grease popcorn nuff said .
terrible service im pretty forgiving but the delivery service here is a joke i called up and the woman on the line could barely take my order too busy talking to someone else and then they forgot about my delivery .
great beer selection constant rotation one of my favorite spots for brunch as well new orleans style menu cafe au lait beignets hush puppies yum never had a bad meal there the lunch and dinner menus are delicious also definitely a place to go for drinks andor food .
came here last week with my pregnant girlfriend food was really great ordered takeout tonight and disgustingly found a cockroach in my noodles we called the restaurant and they were kind enough to comp us our next meal sadly i wont be back .
really really good stuff creole hot sausage po boy w mac and cheese for me vegetarian nachos for her would recommend all of it .
lunch special about 5 25 fried rice sauteed vegetables and shrimp quite americanized food very disappointed owner is sczchuan provincial refugees from china then moved to taiwan then to philly .
my favorite restaurant delicious vegan po boys i have been to nawlins and this place is the real deal their fries and mashed potatoes vegan are amazing love the huge beer menu and basically just the entire vibe and atmosphere perfect night out spot .
mediocre food kale salad tastes like raw roughage ok burger horrible horrible service we had to get up and ask for the stuff we needed save your dollars and go elsewhere .
grub so very good beer menu so very big i dream of beignets .
overpriced and overrated there are much better options in the area the food is decent at best .
not surprised the same people who own the royal tavern would have another killer gastropub the food here rocks seriously get the bbq platter with biscuits mac and cheese was insane everything actually was awesome .
racist racist bartenders and servers honestly dont know why any people of color patronize this bar .
khyber pass pub offers some great cajunstyle bar food and new orleans staples muffaletta catfish po boys shrimp po boys collard greens and fried okra are all really good brunch has some unique items boudin and eggs bananas foster french toast bbq hash try the creole bloody mary .
this place misses the mark on the chorizo bocadillo bread is thick and there is not much chorizo or cheese let down especially for 8 50 .
this is a 4 5er very good stuff reasonable prices surf and turf po boy rivals parkway brothers the bread on it was actually the biggest let down surprising in such a bread strong city ill def be coming back .
really not worth the wait .
i had another great little meal here the server leslie is awesome she recommended a great light beer for me my friend and i ordered dessert beignets which were so delicious ive never had a bad experience or a bad meal here .
this place gives me diarrhea but the bathroom is cool .
i really loved this place good atmosphere though a bit loud loved there huge selection of craft beers was disappointed with their pulled pork i recommend the po boy sandwich and the nugget nectar and the grumpy monk .
food is gorgeously presented but not actually that tasty and our waitress was kinda clueless and we had to wait forever for some of our food .
great spot they always have a good variety of beers available on tap and the food is delicious i could go for a solid beer with a fried green tomato blt any day of the week .
this place is really frustrating i think it could be great but i find the food just mediocre which such a good location jane is a disappointment .
yum my husband is from the south so we love to try bbq wherever we go bbq brisket sandwich melts in your mouth and the sweet potato fries were the perfect compliment great beer selection casual low key dining .
this place used to be so good but the prices increased and the menu changed for the worse .
we only stopped in for a couple drinks on our way to somewhere else so we didnt eat the beer selection was great and the bartender was knowledgeable and friendly it was a great place to relax and enjoy a beer after work definitely want to go again .
dinner here was ok but tastes were bland and uninteresting all in all a little too expensive for what you get .
nice atmosphere good place to have dinner or drinks with a few friends vegan pulled pork was not superb but pretty ok .
cannot go wrong with any of the benedicts steak and eggs suck bellini was terrible no puree peaches service was incredible slow unlikely to come back .
really really great poy bos collards and mac and cheese and have a wide beer selection great place .
incompetent hostesses made this restaurant a very bad place to eat guest were allowed to stay way to long which pushed back reservation times clearly the management has not been properly trained .
lip smacking good i have been here just to drink eat brunch and have dinner all are approved from this southern girl its not exactly like home but pretty damn good for philly plus the khyber has always been a great hangout creole bloody suggested for brunch bam .
ambiance tacky like a doctors office waiting room food meh undercooked burgers overlemoned brussel sprouts okay fries waitstaff hideous actually said to me if you want something you should speak up .
these guys know bbq great food and friendly service .
the food was so meh i had the vanilla bean french toast meh it was pricey and not very flavorful the other plates looked meh dinner food with a twist if you want my suggestion stay away youre welcome .
went here for beers a few weekends ago on a night out in old city great selection and super helpful bar staff i really loved the atmosphere and laid back 20something crowd didnt get food but would definitely love to go back and try it .
this is one overpriced place for a nice relaxed brunch that is always crowded wouldnt go again since there are so many more places in the city that have better quality food better prices and shorter wait times .
food is always on point and i love how the jukebox has television richard hell and the voidoids and joy division .
after reding the reviews i was pretty disappointed with this place crowded service was fair and the food less than impressive i especially dislike when im told i have to wait 10 minutes and it turns out being half an hour .
always a good time well done it makes me feel like a dandy and a bit grimy all at once love it .
overrated .
my favorite after work spot amazing wings great beer .
i wont go again very crowded place waiters in a hurry to see you go as other customers waiting in line very salty and greasy food too much on the plate .
great beer selection awesome cajun food the cheese fries with smoked cheddar and debris gravy was excellent as were the nachos the boudin balls and the chili all in all an unpretentious bar with good food and beer in olde city cant go wrong here .
i was not impressed with jane we went on a thursday evening and the restaurant was empty the food was meh .
there are few truly great lunch places in old city philadelphia if you are looking for a sandwich this probably the best the pulled pork is absolutely amazing servers and beer list well informed and sides worth being a main attraction all their own .
we waited and hour to be seated despite having a reservation we were given 14 glass complimentary cocktail so there was a quarter effort by the restaurant to say sorry i ordered the eggs benedict it was bland and the sauce had way too much butter .
nice beer selection havent had the food yet but from what i have seen it looks delish .
jane seemed to be nice but i was there on october 15th and i got food poisoning from the jane burger .
delicious mac cheese great veganveg options love the atmosphere here my waitress was very friendly .
ate here a couple times and didnt like the food got sick after eating the jane burger once .
yay for southern food best mint julep ive ever had and great atmosphere im giving it a five star even though my jumbalaya was unbelievably and intolerably spicy not for pussies .
the food was great but the bellinis left something to be desired .
i love this place when i think about where id love to sit and have a great beer good vegan food and enjoy always friendly downtoearth service with charming pub ambiance this is the place i think of vegan popcorn yes please and thank you .
i would probably give it two stars but im scandalized that it has an average of four there are so many good restaurants to go to in new york i dont know why anyone would go here boring decor and bland if not dreadful food .
my favorite bar in philly 20112012 good food great staff fun eclectic patrons lovely jukebox thanks for being one of the only nondive bars in philly thats more than beyond tolerable .
after ordering and waiting 45 minutes for our food our server came over and apologized told us there had been a mistake and took out his pad and started to ask us what we had ordered we said thanks but no thanks and left .
had fried shrip po boy that was good french fries were very good great selection of micro brews had russian imperial stout and sly fox odyssey imperial ipa both were excellent seemed a bit under staffed but friendly enough .
busy loud disappointing food is blah ordered shrimp shumai ramen and sweet chili chicken wings shumai was passable as was the ramen the wings stank skin not even close to being crispy .
vegan pulled pork i think so .
sashimi not particularly fresh or good dont order the cold soba its actually cold ramen house saki was good value for money not impressed wont return .
ohhh man i think ive found my new favorite spot vegan poboys vegan pulled pork vegan slaw and vegan dessert heaven on earth .
dont come here on a friday night theyll take over an hour to make and bring you a sushi roll .
awesome beer selection friendly and helpful service warm ambience dark upon entering but once your eyes adjust its pretty cool .
they dont always have what you want at lunch i e mentai spaghetti be prepared to wait during lunch food was mediocre fried karage chicken was bland could have used some sauce because all i tasted was oil noodles were average .
awesome food and wonderful service highly recommend .
food was ok but worse service ever possibly new servers im guessing but bad enough that i dont care to go back i hate bad service theres better restaurants .
solid bar and good service my first time here they were inviting and engaging and the bartender was very cool to talk to go here and enjoy yourself .
unfortunately our food really sucked the caesar salad had these gross little rubbery croutons the pizza literally had black burnt crap from the oven all over it rendering it nearly inedible positives great beer selection good service .
dear khyber i love you i will sit at your bar and drink your many beers and play on your jukebox and devour your foods forever and for always kp .
very strange decor and lacks ambiance the owners gave this place a very cheap reno using laminate flooring tackily decorated with fake plants and poorly slapped together booths looks like a movie set weird room space the bar area is poorly separated and strangely lighted food was ok .
long ass wait an hour to be exact but totally freakin worth it awesome bbq maybe best in the city plus they hooked us up with a round of free beers for the long wait highly recommend just maybe not on friday night lol .
i went in at lunch 4 tables were occupied i sat for 15 minutes without so much as a glance from a server i went elswhere for lunch if this is the way they treat customers they wont be around long .
amazing food great rotating beer selection .
lacks atmosphere very much a chain restaurant decor bar leaves your back to a loud dining room pizza was just okay nothing special wings are breaded so not for a traditionalist lots of micro brews on tap mostly local brews a great place for suburbanites service was fine .
funky fun flavorful great beer list i had the bacon grease popcorn which is just awesomely fingerlicking good speaking of fingerlicking i also had the fried chicken with collard greens and smoked cheddar fries so good will return .
pizza served with a side of pretentiousness not only is the place hideous on the exterior the food the awful and the beer is gross bring back ponderosa .
a nice little pub iin olde city drinks are relatively cheap 5 for vodka tonics the decor is fun and its crowded but not overly packed i would definitely come again the next time im in the area .
almost 4 dollars for a taco that could only feed a keebler elf are you guys serious their shakes are good however .
wandered in here with a friend and was wonderfully surprised by the excellent selection of beers on tap but the must try snack here is the bacon popcorn spicy and delicious .
tasty certainly not worth 3 27 for one mini pork asada taco expensive snack the cool thing is you can watch the lady make the tortilla and the tortilla is fresh and tasty .
enjoy this place while you can because i get the feeling its going to take off and become a very crowded destination in a short period of time the food here would make even anthony bourdains head explode handsdown the best pub grub in philly .
we ate here yesterday and my girlfriend got food poisoning this was the only meal we didnt share i did not get sick was wondering if any one else was having this problem .
the po boys rock will be back again .
cash only food just ok .
really good po boys catfish and fried chix were both really good really good mac and cheese too .
would not let us sit at a table for drinks unless we ordered food even though the bar was totally full waitress didnt know what type of beer kolsch was or where it was from tourist trap .
khybers smoked beef brisket is tender and succulent and their muffuletta sandwich comes on the correct authentic bread something that gets produced in the kitchen here very laid back atmosphere and super friendly staff .
bad service a racially charged name only a hipster would come up with and an environment only they would enjoy i dont care if the dog is named after it if you are used to only fresh quality ingredients you might want to avoid their sauce and cheese .
i cant remember what i ordered when i checked this spot out last month but i can remember how delicious the bacon grease popcorn was and for that i will definitely be back nice selections of beer too .
overpriced overcooked and just nasty .
i randomly stumbled upon this restaurant and am so happy i did this place is veggie friendly and oh soo good the veggie sausage sandwich was delicious along with the baked mac and cheese .
very chi chi poo poo has anyone noticed that this restaurant has gone from a bustling every table full destination to a mostly empty table eatery there is a reason .
great beer list wonderful bartenders who are friendly bacon popcorn incredible gumbo yum .
fort defiance your menu alienates vegetarian customers the monday veggie burger is a joke all vegetarians i know hate dr praegers home made ones are so much better thats my recommendation .
been here twice already and both have been great experiences theyve got a ton of beer on tap friendly bartenderswaitstaff and good tunes great place to relax after a stressful workweek .
a fine place good beers and an imaginative retro trash menu the food is always too salty .
the khyber is my favorite place heres why 1 so many beers 2 fried green tomatoes sweet potato fries 3 lovely bartenders 4 10 minute walk from where i live 5 jukebox atmosphere dining area plus soon they will have shows upstairs .
service was rude and indifferent clientele was postfraternity i wont go back .
wow love the transformation from dive bar to gastropub the food is wonderful and a great selection for vegans the beer list is great too very nice staff and cozy space .
super overpriced and the plates are underwhelming crab is expensive yes but the quality is so not worth the price you can go to a coastal restaurant with local crab and get the same dish that is much more delicious and much bigger wont go back .
stopped in here to try the food after seeing a movie the staff are all really really nice and helpful the food specials and beer selection are fairly priced id definitely come back again still not the same vibe as the old khyber though .
overpriced dog food i would t feed this to my dog the crab legs are skimpy and cheap quality save your money go to wegmans and make them yourself its that easy .
i love this place nice to have healthy fresh options love the avocado toast and if you are lucky they will have tomgirl juices at hand trying the taquitos tonight .
tasteless falafel and pickles were yukky great service beautiful place but really no flavour .
great little spot on the river nice outdoor seating very friendly service really light and healthy good food love the 5 taco special well be back for sure .
ordered lamb shawarma and it was awful first of all the meat was cold and the meat was not good it was over cooked but yet cold hows that possible the staff was very nice but i didnt like the food and cant recommend it to anyone .
tempeh tacos were a hit not all that pretty looking but the taste was perfect i liked the range of options and will be coming back btv needed a place like this .
food is okay but too refined flavors and spices not well balanced and not blended meat in meat dishes was tough overall the quality is good enough to pass for a quick meal .
i could eat their breakfast sandwich every day for the rest of my life totally affordable everything is delicious a dream come true for someone with food restrictions of any kind .
tried the moroccan menu a couple weeks ago not good first kitchen meltdown table next to us got raw center chicken we got nothing nothing nothing then about to leave finally got our food bland and dull lets hope they get it together but i wont be back .
breakfast sandwich with eggplant bacon was amazing will definitely be back to try something else cool location on the river but very crowded inside .
used to be much better the food has lost most of its flavor hummus and falafel were very disappointing was once a regular will give them one more chance .
alva was great we had the mussels and the short rib entree the mussels were plump and the short ribs were tender and delicious with a yummy sauce the service was excellent this was such a surprise gem to find in newark but i would definitely recommend it .
just had one of the worst felafel sandwiches at the maplewood stock this is not a pita wrap the pita was thin tough i was not inspired to return maybe when you have had great this does not measure up .
excellent cheesesteaks and service my motherinlaw is allergic to pepper and they cleaned their grill to accommodate us .
the food is okay but the delivery service leaves a lot to be desired we have ordered delivery twice and each time it is over an hour later than originally stated .
best steak in philly i went with the provolone and wiz my new go to spot when visitors ask for the cheese steak .
not for me dry and the pita falls apart yuck .
every time i go to philadelphia i make sure and stop here they have the best cheesesteak try it with swiss instead of wizz .
waaaay overrated food is typical family style large portion fare to fill you up for a decent price not bad but nothing to rave about either .
delicious .
went with a big group and had a great meal and excellent service went back with just the wife and the service wasnt as good and the meal was very mediocre 50 success rate doesnt cut it for me .
best cheesesteaks in philly hands down freshly made ribeye steaks ambrosia buns with cheesewiz .
like balthazar only not nyc but not quite they didnt quite get it but that doesnt make it bad robs bistro in madison is just so much better .
if youre visiting philadelphia you should definitely go here and have the classic cheesesteak its very filling and delicious .
i have no idea what happened to this place it used to be a terrific if overly msgd restaurant i think that there are new owners the food was overly greasy under seasoned and gross at least i have an msg headache we all feel sick .
beef steak cheese wiz onions with fries so delicious loved the bread very juicy but not so much that it was a mess sat next to the door fast and super friendly already craving another until next time philly .
food is not very fresh and the service is kind of bad .
first time in philly so of course we needed to have a cheesesteak thanks to tips on yelp we were able to avoid long lines at tourist stops i dont eat steak so was thrilled with a chicken option topped with blue cheese great meal .
liked the chicken sandwich a lot but thought the sides were kind of run of the mill if you go there try the jalapeño mashed potatoes they are pretty good all in all its a good chicken sandwich at a park slope price .
did not disappoint got the classic with cheese wiz and grilled onions awesome highly recommended .
ate breakfast there weak coffee had to send back the runny omlet to be cooked more cormed bef hash was right out of a can not fresh as the server had specifically indicated and service was lacking wont go back .
this place was amazing the staff was fast friendly and the philly cheese steaks were to die for we even ordered a 2nd it was so good .
food is unremarkable and overpriced the server objected when i tried to plug in my laptop into the outlet who does that .
first time in philly found this place while visiting historical sites very happy we did excellent steaks fries just a short wait even right at noon cute plenty of seating my companion said the steak and fries were both so good she didnt know what to eat first .
the food is good but the service is mediocre .
pretty good cheesesteak the beef was really what made this one shine if i could take the beef from this place and the sesame bread from johns roast pork you would have the perfect cheesesteak .
not so good my chefs special 4 chicken wrap with red peppers and vinagarette was too drenched in that sauce and there was too much chicken inside it the fries seemed kind of old too not so good .
food was good seating was a little tough to get but overall the experience was good its worth giving a shot .
waited an hour to get our food and it was room temperature an 18 burger should at least be heated before being served if i want a delicious mushroom burger ill go down the street to shake shack where at least the quality is consistent .
great steak wit compares to pats on passyunk a little bit nicer people if you dont know exactly what you want they dont soup nazi you on to the back of the line not a lot of seating so be prepared to wait or share a table .
its vegan dont be fooled by the big burger in front .
came from california to get a cheesesteak from philly this place was really good if your from out of town definitely stop here .
this is great idea with a terrible business plan the food is good but the prices are unjustified a hamburger without bread and any sides for 10 .
best cheesesteak ever pats and genos cant hold a candle to this place they are big meaty cheesy and perfect this place also has okay customer service real cheez wiz i dont know what else to say great place .
nice burguer although quite small but the house made soda was too sweet the fries were completely soggy and the service was extra slow wont come back .
best philly cheese steak sandwich ever we have visited philadelphia twice and stopped by both times we have yet to be disappointed great sandwiches perfect place for a quick bite when you only care about the food and not the ambience .
expensive menu for what i ordered 10 for a flatbread 3 for a shot of almond milk for my coffee and 6 for french fries lovely decor inside though .
yummmm hubbie had provolone onion i went for the wiz mmmm i will crave this for life .
the food was okay we had lunch here and it came to be 50 i think its a bit pricey the burgers werent even that good .
long wait but soooo worth it cheesesteak and adding bacon awesome a great gem near the liberty bell have cash ready and some patience .
i been here twice in one year and there is significant difference in price and quality of food definitely not returning here again .
my fav cheesesteak spot not to chewy compared to pats or greasy the line can get long but there is a reason why its damn tasty .
this place is terrible we went here for dinner during philly beer week the food was terrible the service was terrible and the bathrooms were appalling seriously im not a food snob in any sense and this place was awful .
this meat beats mine i wish i was kidding lol .
the food was just average but the service was not only slow it was outright rude i am not going back for sure .
sonnys delivers on great philly cheesesteaks and the fries are amazing fun and friendly service just a short walk from independence hall im not easy to please but this place impresses .
one of my colleagues loves this place so i have suffered through many a lunch the service is always horrible the food is gross and its always more expensive then it should be and its hot inside .
a great place to get a classic cheesesteak not many menu options but you dont need too many in a place like this yum .
average burger for an above average price .
the cheese steak is fine 4th star for the freshly cut meat right in front of your eyes you can definitely taste it the line at 230 pm on a friday afternoon was around 25 minutes they do take cc and are nice catering to tourist questions .
really cool space not sure why i like it so much but i do really mediocre bbq really mediocre service .
drooooool i had an original it was a religious experience i want another one now seriously it was friggan amazing and worth the wait in line for this arkansas boy looking for a real philly cheese steak .
i enjoy their food for brunch but someone needs to soothe me right now and change their delivery status this very second they only deliver in a four block radius what kind of bullshit is that i want a veggie burger and cornbread .
im not a traditional cheese steak fan cant speak to that but i cant live without sonnys cheese steak hoagie with provolone .
food was good but owner spoke to us with such disrespect that it will be a long time before i go back he was arrogant rude and unbelievably nasty .
best fries and good service workers are nice and one of the best places to get a philly steak could be better but overall was really tasty and the bread went nice with the steak .
see no posting from the management to my review as i said they only like to reply to positive reviews .
fresh everything our all around favorite nothing fancy just great cheesesteak .
decent food that is healthy the whole duck is hard to eat its not carved and a bit dry .
believe the hype this is as good as a cheesesteak can get i went with onions whiz and american cheese which added to the delicious melty factor were all looking for perfect balance of soft yet chewy bread fresh high quality ribeye and cheese awesome .
good breads mostly known as a place you can see nora ephron and other hollywood insiders basically just a box dropped in the middle of the meadows noisy as hell at suppertime .
very little seating highly recommended by the locals the cheesesteak with the traditional cheez whiz was delicious the whole family liked it even though half of us had to stand .
ive experienced better for a fraction of the cost .
amazing quality meat and soft bread with hot peppers and onions wish we were staying in philly longer just so i could come back to this place .
went during restaurant week and was not impressed with the service maybe it is because we didnt order alcohol not at all impressed with that food was good octopus appetizer was spectacular beautiful place .
classic with fries and a drink do it .
quoted 20mins for a table after 45 mins we gave up staff was good management was full of excuses my advice less cologne there buddy .
my first ever cheesesteak so not sure exactly what defines a good cheesesteak sonnys was delish soft bun tons of meat sufficient cheese quick service id go back again .
not impressed i got the thai chicken wrap and waffle fries she got the sliced london broil and mashed potatoes she added salt which she never does but if you are in the mood for an apple crisp this is the place to go .
had the cheesesteak hoagie and onion rings all i can say is that both were awesome place was a mix of locals and tourists .
food was boring and slightly overpriced and service was nonattentive sure the patio is great and all but quality food should be any restaurants main sellingpoint not outdoor dining .
the cheesesteaks are good albeit a bit small they are far superior to campos but not quite at the level of steves the fries are tasty but far too salty my rankings thus far steves 10 tony luke 9 genos 8 pats 7 campos 4 .
went for valentines day we had a limited menu that had the price jacked up a good 20 not impressed the food was not worth the base price let alone the added premium will not be back .
from california and after eating here i bought a second sub the best philly cheesestake .
yawn build your own crepe anyone .
oh yea good stuff philly cheese steak in philly sonnys .
great crepes bad experience hoitytoityness abounds without warrant loosen up beau monde youre an upscale ihop learn from the greek myth of narcissus its fine to be beautiful just not at the cost of great selfimportance .
i must say that i was thoroughly impressed with my meal definitely glad we decided to stop here instead go going to pats or genos if i ever came back to pa then i would definitely stop here again yummy .
someone hacked my prior review this place is not good poor quality sushi decor is decent and wait staff is nice but the sushi is cheap and tastes cheap im guessing someone affiliated with the restaurant hacked my prior review .
we were sent here by a local recommendation glad we went it was tasty fast and clean even the restrooms .
small plates and very little amount of potato there is so many places with bigger plates better prices and definitely nicer area do not through your money in this place while you are living or visiting brooklyn .
worth the wait we had two types in our group the classic with onions and whiz and the other with onions and provolone the whiz won in our group .
the owner is a beeyotch rudely informed me the diet coke i walked in with wasnt permitted even though i ordered plenty of food avoid .
whatever happened the last time i was here was corrected the meat was tender and tasty the wait was short and i was very impressed .
cold pizza wrong toppings order from here after a really long wait 1 14 hours vs 45 minutes i was told they delivered the wrong pizza charging us 5 more for toppings they didnt deliver skip it they dont care at all .
solid philly cheese sandwich ordered a traditional sonnys whizwith and another provolonewith both were very good kids ordered bacon cheeseburger grilled cheese choice of two cheeses cheese and regular fries and an onion ring everyone was happy and satisfied with selection .
wrong pizza delivered after waiting over an hour for the delivery dont bother ordering from here .
its really good above average cheesesteak chewy and soft bread very cheesy and wellcooked beef this place is different from other cheesesteak places because of their bread its more fresh than the other places .
the service was fine the drinks were ok but the food was terrible the taste was mediocre but i ordered the rabbit ravioli and got the full plate and it came with 8 raviolis for 26 come to this place for drinks do not come for dinner .
sonnys steaks are great very cheese fresh made right when you order i had the classic cheese steak w cheese wiz and cheese fries place is small and clean friendly staff .
cool atmosphere being in an old train station but i feel as if they are trying to hard have too much going on with menu and drink selections not too far off base just a little i thought the food was just ok and somewhat expensive for location .
my favorite cheesesteak in philladelphia brought a friend here on a work trip and he blasphemously ordered a cheesesteak with mozzarella despite my objections the staff did not string him up by his ears for a public flogging which my friend appreciated .
was there twice in the past month the first time with friends it was great the second time it was just the wife and i and the service was slow and the food was just ok for those type of prices they need to be more consistent .
got a philly with cheese wiz may not sound appetizing but buddy it was some oowey gooey deliciousness .
over priced niche awkward give this a few months before they board up the windows .
quiet lil cheese steak joint nestled under the fluffy comforter of old city best cheese steak in philly hands down you cant beat our meat .
i probably wont be returning here i loved the atmosphere but the food was overpriced and just okay the bisque lacked salt and flavor .
fast friendly service sandwich was the bomb diggity nice and clean and we could actually sit down and eat chill music and we will come back on our next trip to philly .
lousy thats it just lousy .
sonnys has my vote for best cheese steak in the city consistently awesome gets real busy though be prepared to wait a bit for your food .
the pizza was unbelievably salty no one could eat it in our family i had to drink so much water afterwards the only good part was that the guy at the counter was really nice but thats about it .
daaaaaang thats a great philly cheesesteak fries were good too great little spot will take all my tourist visitors right to sonnys for the authentic cheesesteak experience .
we were visiting friends and did takeout one night was not expecting much and that is what we got food was just average generally and some dishes were very bland others way too salty .
i had mine with onions and cheez wiz amazing .
this is just terrible americanized chinese food every dish tastes the same if you like salt and glop and dislike subtle flavors in your food this might be the place for you that said its still chinese food so you know it will be decent at least .
the best cheesesteak in philly hands down they dont deliver though despite what yelp says .
the pizza here doesnt taste good very thin and very greasy and too saucy i live close by and order from them only when i have no other choice .
the lady behind the counter is a doll the food is fresh and the soda is bubbly i recommend sonnys to anyone in the historic district .
just had neils late night we both had focaccia not that good it came out of the oven cold wasnt as good as it used to be .
best place to get a cheesesteak on market street the staff was friendly and got my food out fast even though it was busy the steak was very flavorful and juicy this place is expensive but worth it .
when i was there it was very loud the sicilian pizza was not what i had expected at all on the plus side there was plenty of seats available .
small quiet place great cheesesteak there was only one employee there when we went and he was very friendly definitely the best cheesesteak we had while in philly only down side not the cleanest place .
meh its cute server was nice those are the stars food is overpriced considering the portions are minuscule 20 for the tiniest plate of pasta ever set before you the meal itself is nothing special youre better off going elsewhere .
sonnys was great just what a philly cheese steak should be service was fast place was clean and the cheese steak with cheese wiz was perfect we also tried the cheese fries and onion rings which were good also cheese wiz over provolone hands down .
welcoming spot with friendly service and lots of potential but rather inconclusive food steak barely warm and too chewy pork belly dry very dry im italian born and raised so i know im a tough judge for italian food sorry but these two dishes were very forgettable .
we had our first official philly cheesesteak here and it was a great experience the place was full of locals and a few firefighters so we had high hopes we went for the cheesesteak with wiz salty gooey delicious .
honestly theyve screwed me too many times now with coldold food or just stupidly complicated recipes that look pretty and taste poorly used to be cool no longer .
tasty and great friendly staff delicious philly sandwiches .
just stopped in the bar good selection of bottled beer not much on tap service seem a bit disinterested .
good solid cheesesteaks thats all they do unlike campos a few doors over but they do it well if youre trying to decide between the two go to sonnys no contest its touristy prices but thats to be expected given the locale .
went for the hot dogs because ny magazine said they were the best in the city ny magazine should fire whoever wrote that the hot dogs are easily the worse in nyc .
absolutly recommend for get the famous philly steak the meat was very good but please sit outside the street deserves to be seated outside .
cool ambience but 11 for half beers seriously even though they were delicious thats pretty harsh food was ok but our meal ended up costing a fortune and still left us unfulfilled .
menu only has about 4 options so its not a hard choice and the cheesesteak was the best i have had so far .
beers are so overpriced food is lackluster clientele is douchey theres a cute backyard but its always so crowded why bother ive tried this place three times and i really wanted to like it as its right near my house and should be cute instead its just lame .
the inside of this place is not attractive better for takeout prices are what you expect for the location add stuff to your steak will drive up the price on the weekend i would recommend coming around 130 am before the barsclubs close at 2 .
12 for a cuban that has about 1oz of pulled pork and 1 slice of ham hater look at the picture i posted .
great cheesesteaks very generous with peppers and onions fast no nonnonsense service dont forget to add a cherry pepper .
not what it used to be quality has gone downhill since new ownership a couple years ago .
good food and service .
my second time here and i think it will be my last buffet style food looks like it been there for over 12 hours i came with friends i was excited walking in leaving disappointed .
ok if you are in philly and you want the authentic cheesesteak sandwich this is the place to go it was recommended by a local and they were too right the fries are to die for and you can tell it is the place where the locals go .
our waiter emerson gave himself a 15 gratuity despite the bad service he personally provided this man ignored the 2 of us never smiled and never offered to clean our table i would recommend avoiding this place based on service .
great philly cheesesteak though coming from california my knowledge of what constitutes an excellent pc is limited great fries too .
never going back to this place .
very good and tasty best cheesesteak ive had while i was visiting philly please open a shop in hawaii .
meats were great buffet could have had more variety ive had better nice waiter but he wouldnt let us take home meat we hadnt finished annoying .
best cheese fries in old city staff is really friendly too .
underwhelming the hostess looked like a deer in headlights took forever to get our food and steak tips were super fatty wont be coming back too many other good restaurants in town .
came here for philly cheesesteak based on our guides recommendation this place did not disappoint .
only thing good is the beer .
a haiku review bucket o cheezwhiz slather it on nice and thick cheesesteak so tasty .
the service is friendly and its a nice looking place but the food is horrendous its not good quality the sauces are inappropriate for the dishes and the dishes are not interesting .
great place and great food the cheese steak was fabulous they were super friendly and gave us extra bread for our picky 4 yearold .
they dont make their own products a true french bakery would be ashamed of the quality of le petit parisien all of the baked goods are purchased and sold in store this is just not right gina and montclair bakery at least make their own items homemade .
good but not the greatest it sure is original but not many options .
macaroons kinda pricy for its quality coffee selection not too big service ignoring customers .
so so amazing my dad used to live next door to this place and i would eat there all the time when i visited i miss it so much .
stopped in for an espresso turns out they use those plastic kuerig style pods instead of a legit espresso machine bummer espresso was weak if you are a european style cafe charging prium prices you have to serve a legit espresso .
my first cheeseteak loved the saltiness of the whiz .
i tried 5 different flavors and didnt love any of them the cafe is cute and the staff was friendly but that didnt make up for the lack of flavor and disappointment i felt over my macarons .
philly cheese steaks were pretty good the steak is incredibly tender and mixed with the cheese is enough to satisfy any appetite .
too sugary too sweet went on a 5pm afternoon the macaroons were slightly hard like bread not soft at all the fillings tasted like i was eating a bowl of sugar .
get a wiz wit amazing .
a bit too bright for my tastes .
was in town from new york and dropped into this place quick and delicious i had the philly with wiz and i mopped up the oozy cheezy oniony juices with my fresh crispy fries im coming back for sure .
we ordered a couple of dishes including a mutton biriyani the mutton in the biriyani was horrible it was so damn rubbery that we simply didnt eat more than a bite the furniture looks horrible they probably got it from a dumpster .
this place was a godsend as it was one of the few places open late on a saturday night the bread was soft wiz plentiful without being messy and the meat was tender their onion rings are pretty good too .
hyderabad birayani without basmati rice and so dry and smelly the raita was so think too really i hated it .
we were visiting philly and sonnys was recommended by our concierge incredible cheesesteak sandwiches and fries both reasonably priced will def visit again .
terrible service mediocre food at best friend has wheat allergy told waiter what does he bringfood with wheat goat kabob was tasteless ordered soup which never arrived had to request plates overcharged us on check stay away .
im on a diet now and i have to constantly fight off walking down the block and getting a cheesesteak from this place damn they make good ones here im pretty sure i dont know of a better cheesesteak in old city .
went here with a few friends definitely not our scene caters to a young crowd the drink selections are decent but the apps we shared were ok at best small and noisy place .
good meat ive only had the cheesesteak here but they have good steak the sandwich isnt ovewhelmingly humongous so thats nice and the staff is awesome this is the place i always suggest to visitors cash only though .
9 11 for draft beers on a weekday during happy hour get out of here much better prices for craft brew in the area .
three words best cheesesteaks ever .
why such high reviews my chicken burrito was bland with too much sauce that was just dripping wasnt even really warm either never again .
super friendly and helpful staff made for a wonderful experience at the suggestion of the cashier we ordered cheesesteaks with onions cheese whiz and mushrooms it was tasty and satisfying after a long day of walking in the cold .
so disappointed terrible service at the bar there was one other person and felt like i was getting the attention of a bartender 3 deep guac cechive and cocktails were not worth it boo starr never again .
why do i pick this place over some of the popular tourist places the meat are tender and not chopped to itsy bitsy pieces and get this the wiz were plenty and veeeeeeeeeeeeery gooey not watery the services were extremely awesome .
food was terrible when we comment on the pork having to much fat the waiter said this is a characteristic of the dish we had travel all the way from south jersey to this terrible place .
my 1 cheesesteak place puts pats genos jims steves and tony lukes to shame staff is a food is a .
the food was okay the wine list by the glass pretty poor and the service fair at best .
surprisingly great food obviously fresh made with care great small plate fare meats cheeses etc grab a flight of wine for a nice variation with your meal .
this was the noisiest restaurant i have ever eaten in in 55 years the food was delicious enough said .
food was great ambiance was very romantic will definitely visit again .
crap food skirt steak was burnt dry and chewy for 30 this place is a rip off .
went there last night after being turned away at several other restaurants in the area the place is much bigger than it looks service was fast place was nice and staff were helpful the food was good the tiramisu was awesome .
whats the hype about so mediocre it isnt even funny i want the 2 hours of my life i spent here back unimpressive .
uva is a great place for a first date the atmosphere is extremely romantic for a more detailed review please click the link below halsteadproperty tumblr … .
one word overrated just expected a lot more from this place i dont have specifics because i cant even remember i went almost a year ago but this place is not memorable .
romantic .
i recently took my hottie here for dinner and it was not good what happened is only rice n beans .
food is absolutely amazing every single dish was just great the decor is beautiful and the staff are really really nice i will definitely be back here very soon .
waited and waited for a reservation and was so disappointed even the flan was just so so mojitos were excellent i guess thats something .
love this place but need to review the strawberry pancakes i dont even like pancakes but these things are the best thing in life i crave them daily amazing the other food and drinks are too but do yourself a favor and try the pancakes yum .
meh over rated wait staff is weird and kept saying thank you after every thing i said a thank you did not belong in the conversation bread is good though .
excellent food and excellent service the antipasto was the best ive had in the city loss of 1 star due to the 50 minute wait we were promised 30 min i would definitely go back but will probably go late evening to avoid the crowds .
how does this man continue to get business the food is either so bland or over seasoned its scary .
very good for brunch .
slow service boring menu average food dull dining room im really struggling to understand the hype here the two stars are solely for the burger which my meat obsessed husband said was one of the best hes had ever other than that meh .
this place has great food and great ambiance perfect for catching up with friends or a date night .
we had a christmas party herevery loud atmospherechic area typical 3 course meal nothing spectacular to note in the review other than meh p .
great little wine bar happy hour features a nice pour and a choice of appetizer included very friendly bar staff .
place is not worth all the hype .
i took my boyfriend here for his birthday dinner and we loved it the food was fresh and flavorful the service was great and the ambiance was romantic it was a bit noisy inside but thats honestly my only complaint well be back there soon .
waited at the bar with my friend for at least 10 minutes there were 4 bar tenders and no one acknowledged us we were going to have dinner but ended up leaving and going to barbounia on the corner which was brilliant .
the food and ambiance were great i definitely recommend the pizza style bread for starters .
good service but very mediocre food i found a disgusting chunk of lamb tendon in my meal they should really serve better quality meat to their customers .
mushroom ravioli was really great fair prices for the city ill be back .
overrated great service but lackluster food more of a place to impress outoftown business clients not really a romantic place .
enjoyed the meal the company and the service not a perfect 10 but my salmon was very good in a delicious sauce with asparagus id eat here again .
yesterday it was reported by many that the citys most popular restaurant gramercy tavern didnt do so well on their last heath department inspection they scored 35 points for violations like live roaches and flies which falls in to c grade territory .
nice italian restaurant with good bread i had the ravioli which was goodpretty good but surprisingly enjoyed the anti pasti the most go figure .
roaches and flies sanitation grade c .
my first restaurant in nyc amazing place excellent food and service not pricey at all its a good place to go with friends and get a good meal and take a good wine i really recommend this place .
overrated overpriced food service and ambience are great but the food including deserts is nothing to rave over considering all the hype surrounding this place i wasnt particularly impressed .
had my birthday brunch there food was great and the atmosphere was very nice especially on the outside covered terrace the waitress was a bit clumsy but did not spoil the experience keep in mind that brunch special portions are way too big so might consider sharing .
overrated .
delicious been here many times before for just drinks but had dinner tonight amazing dessert also amazing will return .
there is also a version of this cart along with many many other carts at yale medical schoolyale new haven hospital at cedar and york this cart used to be excellent but now weve found hair in our food twice i would recommend thai awesome instead .
highly recommend this place for a romantic date or just a quick dinner always packed but they take reservations my favorite italian restaurant in ues .
absolutely disgusting ordered the roasted chicken with rice and string beans i got overcookedold rice a slop of canned string beans with some tomato sauce and dried up chicken even after i specifically stated no tomato sauce it left a lot to be desired never going back .
go for meatball monday you get an appetizer entree dessert all in meatball style with a glass of wine for 31 absolutely incredible .
five second review good food really bad and slow service i might have to think twice if i ever want to come here again the staff need to get their act together and get on the same page .
my favorite date place delicious plenty of choices even for super picky eaters great wine selection great service and reasonable prices i couldnt ask for anything better i just keep on going back .
worst greek place the pastichio was dry the place was a rip off .
wonderful restaurant food is creative and delicious and the service excellent dont miss it .
overpriced no desserts lamb platter was hard as rock you are pretty much overpaying for the good tasting pita bread and fries .
perfect date night spot make sure you request the garden area all the way to the back do not leave without the ricotta and honey app it seriously is to daaai for .
pork was very tough but the fries were good .
nice well done smart menu based on high quality ingredients superb atmosphere service fast and appropriate will come back for sure .
do not order from grubhub my order never came and when i called they said the fax machine was busy .
great date spot nice wines upscale much better than any of the competitors on the ues lusardi family does it again .
1 star for service 3 for food their delivery takes forever and is incompetent save yourself the grief and try the halfdozen other chinese restaurants within a halfmile radius .
cozy italian restaurant with terrific food and a great wine list not too pricey good vibe in the restaurant as a result of low lighting and eclectic decorating .
shame on mei gave them another shot at delivery after one not great experience and ive been waiting for an hour and 40 minutes i called to check and i got an im sorry but that was it not worth the wait .
very small and always crowded but worth the tight squeeze btw the tables this was my second time dinning here and it was better than i remember it being the service is top quality and so is the food great italian cuisine option on the ues .
im bewildered by the glowing reviews i was craving some hot soup and ordered the muchballyhooed vegetarian wonton soup it was lukewarm and the wonton filling was mainly minced celery edible but nothing ill ever eat again .
i went there with my friend it was 2nd visit we asked them to pick some dishes up for us all of dished are very good i love veal meatbowl make a reservation is better .
the most bland chicken and broccoli ive ever had .
you cant go wrong with a dish ive tried almost everything and i cant pick my favorite .
food was nasty ordered 2 chicken wings one less salty and one spicy and both came just regular feather stuck on the fried wing yuck lots of chicken hairs not picked out here and there oil dripping from the fantail shrimp .
very large wine selection knowledgeable staff reasonably priced romantic atmosphere great date spot .
i dont care how the food tastes it takes more than an hour and a half to get take out on a sunday night not ok never ever again .
consistently excellent knowledgeable bar cozy but lively atmosphere truffled gnocchi is otherwordly .
stiff runny eggs with no fluff to them few options and overpriced broccoli rabe was weirdly spicy and i normally like spicy foods .
delicious food great lambrusco if you are into that and a beautiful back patio its a no fail i will definitely be back .
food was mediocre but price was offensive for barpub quality food i found it obscene that they charged 8 for bread 3 dabbles of bean spreads and butter we got a rabbit salad shrimp in foiegras mousse eggplant ravioli and a couple other unmemorable dishes cocktails was decent .
the price is reasonable the vibe is cool the service is phenomenal and the gnocchi is unbelievable this was by far one of the best restaurant experiences i have had in new york .
food was good room was ok nothing spectacular 915 reservation not seated until 1015 most of the menu was sold out .
walked by it a million times went there for late dinner with friends had meatball sliders pasta salami short ribs and something else quality was great so was ambiance definitely going back .
i used to think this was the best pizza in the city but of late it hasnt been so good they seem more interested in chatting amongst themselves than not burning the pizza come on guys step up your game .
food wine patio service ambiance and prices loved it all and look forward to a return visit .
i tried this when the last time i visited new york and i wanted to like it so bad because ive heard rave reviews but i think its just not my cup of tea its just overly creamy for me and not much artichoke .
great food have tried many things on the menu and each one of them is really good service can be a little slow but the food is worth the wait .
came back and tried their artichoke pizza it tastes like cream of spinach soup smeared onto a crispy pita .
great bar great sliced meats and cheeses and a delicious flatbread with truffle oil that shouldnt be missed we shared a vealeggplant parm and a pasta with meatballs off the hook good very nice place make sure you get a reservation gets busy .
the delivery guy is drunk somewhere i ordered pizza since four hours a go and everytime i called the lady said it should be there any minute this pizza place is fucked up .
love the backyardgarden good food .
stopped in with my boyfriend late at night there was not much of a line had the famous artichoke slice super expensive and looks a lot better than it tasted it was just a creamy salty mess not worth the billion calories .
love uva delish .
extremely rude wait staff spending 20 on pizza does not get you a place to eat your food in this place so be prepared to sit on the sidewalk .
cute decor friendly staff got the dishes to share and all three were pretty good pretty decent size wine selection too .
place is absolutely disgusting the pizza was all burned and over prized the establishment is tiny with barely any room to eat the drinks werent kept cold either i stick to lbs in brooklyn any day now thats real pizza .
very good rustic interior we have gone several times and have enjoyed it each time .
and thats when you know that americans know nothing about what a good pizza should taste like pretty embarrassing .
just perfect in every way food service wine gnocchi paperdelle yum .
the pizza itself is alright its the staff that needs work whats with the awful attitudes youre not doing me a favor there are a million other pizza places in this neighborhood cheer up guys life doesnt suck that bad .
pretty damn amazing food was delicious and extremely authentic will definitely go back .
worse pizza ever ordered online at 2 am and delivered after 2 hours taste so bad and so oily .
good date spot gets crowded between 73010 go for the wine i only ate a few apps they were ok will try a proper sit down dinner next time .
greasy sloppy mess and they dont even let you sit at the dining room next door after we ordered 5 slices and two beers not coming back noooooooot ever .
this is my go to place for birthdays the atmosphere is rustic yet elegant and the wait staff have always been kind and attentive my favorites are the pappardelle al ragu so delicious definitely a favorite .
grade pending seriously and cash only very sketchy if you ask me dont bother theres 1 pizza with grade a .
the gnocchi di ricotta is to die for the place is beautiful one of my favorite spots in nyc .
i used to go but no longer do pizza is too oil and greasy this is not worth the price and waiting in line use your hands without glove to touch the pizza seriously .
perfect for what we were looking for excellent service gnocchi was too die for i will never forget how rich and delicious it was husband had the duck dish excellent as well would love to come back on our next nyc trip .
i was incredibly underwhelmed by artichoke pizza it was greasy expensive and too cheesy i think the popularity stems solely from the fact that this place is a goto for inebriated persons .
ive livedworked here since 1980 this place is the best incredible staff food atmosphere no need to review since this is a fantastic place to eat drink everything is perfect .
easily the worst pizza in nyc two stars because its open late .
great place to go for brunch and dinner they have a lovely terrace in the back and the food is great .
not the ny style pizza i was looking for disappointed im from ny but have a particular ny style i prefer and this didnt fit the bill .
still a solid 4 stars great place not blown away but have kept coming back here again and again and that says a lot in a city where you can go years without going to the same place twice got mozzarella and gnocchi this time fantastic .
artichoke has tasty pizza but my god we just ordered one before 3 am and received a cold ass pizza at 445 am sober exhausted sad change your hours if youre just going to send your last pizza at closing like a bunch of meanies .
terrific ambience exactly the kind of place i was looking for for a nontouristy late night food wine in new york experience the gnocchi parpadelle are their best dishes in my opinion .
although pizza was good two hour delivery time totally negated everything yup two hour delivery time from 328 e 14 to stuy town .
best italian food ive had in nyc period great sport for vegetarians with tons of options and a great ambiance .
yeah this pizza is way too intense for me everything is just crazy salty cheesy and just over the top including the crust which is just way too doughy for me im good .
is good to know where to find late dining food was very good ambice felt very trending tables small and too close to each other service was fast and attentive the experience was different from i usually dine but i will be back .
terrible oily deep pan pizza with way too much cheese and saturated fat not at all like the thin crust wood fired oven pizza that was advertised on yelp .
amazing food and great service the waiter gave a suggestion for wine for me and my date and it definitely delivered eat here for the sake of all that is human .
not only did they run out of cheese pizza but the sicilian slice i had lacked any flavor people need to go to lombardis and get a lesson in flavor if they feel this place is good .
the food here is amazing we ordered the mini meatballs for appetizer and had the caprese salad and fettuccine for entrees everything was so fresh and delicious however this place loses one star for extremely slow service .
this place is always crowded when walking by and it seems like a hip place to grab a great slice of pizza however went here with my boyfriend and his brother for dinner and the pizza took almost 45 minutes to come out to the table absolutely ridiculous .
the backyard seating is great for special occasions we tried the pan seared duck breast and gnocchi which were excellent .
this place has really gone to crap since they sold out the pizza is like disgusting artichoke soup on top of thick burned bread and it will destroy your insides avoid delivery it takes 24 hours and its cold and disgusting by the time it arrives .
lovely place reasonable prices popular with locals the homemade pastas are delicious and the portions are just right not a fan of truffle oil so i didnt sample the dishes everyone raves about but really everything i have ever had here was delicious .
disappointed maybe i just had a duff slice but my classic artichoke slice was dry with a solid two inches of crust cant complain about portion size though one slice is definitely enough .
great place inside its perfect for catching up with your friends and having a great time without spending a ton of i brought my mom and we sat outside which was better because it was a little quieter out there i recommend this place for sure .
delivery guy was a huge dick didnt carry change apparently customer service doesnt really matter in the restaurant industry .
gnocchi was outrageous would definitely go again .
yeah artichoke lets do it traditional slice for 4 50 no taste shits loads of cheese very filing enuff said .
very nice italian restaurant warm and romantic ambience friendly service delicious food and reasonable price had a wonderful dinner there highly recommended .
i found the creamy artichoke pizza to be way to rich it was like eating alfredo pizza it was gross the other pizzas might be tasty but i wont go back again .
good italian food was very crowdedpopular the night i went but still got seated quickly out door seating great for dates didnt spend much time indoors .
ewww its greasy and tastes disgusting .
cute place high quality and tasty food chicken meatball app was amazing my wifes taglatelle with veal ragout was great sadly my pesto gnocchi was doughy sauce good gnocchi not great service .
crust tastes like frozen pizza topping was decent artichoke pizza minus 1 star for being cash only .
great food the location and ambiance were nice will definitiely go back .
ordered the crab slice and was disappointed because the slice was barely warm the taste of the crab slice itself was decent but i feel like i would have enjoyed it alot more if it was hotter dont think i will be back .
i went there for a saturday meeting with a friend the atmosphere is great for dating the food is delicious the wines are great i would definitely go back again the service is great the atmosphere is pleasant .
waited a half hour longer than the two hour e t a they gave us the very expensive pizza arrived cold and in a pile in the box mortified .
warm inviting space with consistently delicious food .
salty doughy center and burnt crusts whats the rage .
i was in the middle of a fantastic italian trattoria so authentic polenta primi superb flatbreads and cheese selection awesome wine menu perfect penne pasta and gnocchi ridiculously good superb place 5 stars smallish but packed and happening .
tried it for the first time today was disappointed and found the place to be pretty dirty the guy behind the counter who was serving the pizza was also handling money gross .
phenomenal food generous portions warm atmosphere there was a bit of a lag between the appetizers and the entrees but not enough to be really bothersome that was my only complaint otherwise this place is outstanding and an incredible value .
tasty not worth the long line but if you pass by early and its empty stop by .
great spot with cozy atmosphiere and amaizing food prompt service and friendly staff everything is delicious and fresh .
this pizza really isnt that good truly overrated i ordered every slice and they were all badly burnt on the bottom and the crust tasted like cardboard the saving grace were the meatballs not bad .
great italian food request a table in their back courtyard it is so cute also a great place to have wine .
i dont understand the hype around this place i thought the pizza was ok it must be the price for the quantity ordered the margherita and the artichoke pizzas like the m more than the a .
one of the best italian restaurants in the city food was delightful tasty and reasonably priced ambiance was very relaxed cozy and romantic will definitely come back here again .
dont bother i ordered once and it came cold i thought i would try delivery again but after an hour and twenty minutes no pizza after a phone call the staff was aware my pizza hadnt even left yet .
amazing food and great service one of the best italian spots in the city beautiful decor always busy make a reservation .
loved their pizza in the beginning last january i saw mice next to their back door .
upper east side italian hidden gem sunday brunch was delicious atmosphere is super quaint exposed old brick walls antique bar neat neighborhood spot but nothing could ever beat the homemade gnocchi i will think of it often .
the guys that were working on easter shouldve taken the day off if they were gonna come to work with their attitude for now on ill stick with motorino goodbye artichoke .
i think this is one of the best neighborhood restaurants really good food and a decent wine selection the noise is a bit much but that would be my only gripe try the seafood soup amazing .
sicilian pizza was burnt and they did not want to give me a different slice poor service artichoke pizza is good drunk food i would not come here sober for a meal .
place had a wait at 730 on a sunday good for them food service and decor were nice we sat in the back they have a good staff to patron ratio reasonable prices will repeat .
the pizza is way too heavy and salty for my taste i dont understand the appeal unless youre drunk out of your mind .
outstanding the best meal i have had on ues .
very disappointing .
atmosphere is cozy and inviting everyone seems to be having a good time the food is outstanding went back again and it was even better the second time around .
suggested artichokes margarita pie for delivery at work not nearly as good as i remember the less refined palattes amongst me raved however .
my goto for girls dinner love sitting in the back patio it could be great for date night too with their nice wine list it has a great lively atmosphere so feels trendy really enjoy my experience everytime i dine at uva .
slices have gotten smaller and the crust is too thick and not enough toppings im disappointed especially now that its 4 50 a slice .
nice service and good food wine just little bit too busy .
artichoke soup on top of pizza way too much cheese a puddle of grease and a line of nyu students in pajamas make this one of the worst slices of pizza i can remember .
love this place the food is delicious the ambiance is relaxed and the staff is friendly try the gnocchi it wont disappoint .
if you like thick doughy crust we dont gloppy toppings we dont then maybe this is the place for you weve tried it twice and thats it for us we dont get it dont get it dont get it .
excellent restaurant good prices for the city and nice atmosphere .
not a fan of this place gave it a shot as my buddy told me it was a thing to eat in new york im a tomato sauce fan so the artichoke was definitely different slice was big but i just couldnt get into it .
love love this place been twice and had an amazing experience both times last night we split the antipasto plate for two which was amazing and i got the gnocci wonderful cozy atmosphere great service and wonderful food will be back .
for all the berkeley folks out there this place is like la burrita great to go to after a crazy wild drunken evening horribly bad to eat when sober dunno if ill ever go here in broad daylight when im sober like a pregnant woman .
only have been here for brunch its a really cute place the decor is vintage and antiquey they have a nice outdoor seating and a small terrace in the back the food is very good their pancake with mascarpone is delish overall is a little pricey though .
i got a severe case of food poisoning from here on 62311 i know this must be a pretty reliable place for pizza but i think people should know they have their off days i had the stuffed artichoke and a slice of their margherita pizza for dinner .
great place for lunchbrunch cozy with quick service and nice set of italian entries .
avoid the place pizza crust is way too thick and staff is nasty after 5 min of eating my piza the bouncer slapped my pizza box closed do not go .
you literally cannot go wrong at uva everything is so amazing i highly recommend the gnocchi i would eat it every day if it wouldnt eventually make me weigh four hundred pounds i would definitely say this is my favorite italian in the city hands down .
too oily too thick crusted like eating an oily bread i guess its ok for the price and if youre a college kid hanging out late in the village already drunk .
no words to describe this culinary journey exceptional italian food and hospitality just felt like eating mammas home cooked food with both love and taste coming back soon grazie .
unsanitary counter guy has black dirt under his finger nails he touches your money then touches your slice gross really loved the pizza but i cant stomach filthy fingers touching my food .
very noisy bar restaurant area in the front ask for the back room nice garden ambience wonderful wait staff food good overall pleasant dining experience .
is the crab slice ever there .
i really like uva its easy to get a reservation staff is friendly and the food is solid the cheese and meat plates are huge and the pastas are all really tasty a cute and good place on the ues .
decent pizza if you have to take it home and it cools down not as good shit service .
great food great atmosphere .
had two different slices which were ok no place really to eat inside .
very cute place great service and delicious food i recommend the sun dried tomato and pesto bruschetta to start the polenta with black truffle sauce was delicious but a little to rich for its size adorable place .
not really my thing way too dense and rich and no way worth a 20 minute wait in hind sight i shouldve gone to trader joes and got some choke dip and a baguette same difference .
great local tons of energy good food snd great service you will enjoy the experience .
why the wait this is a case of a crowd attracting a crowd this pizza is just not that good in fact i wouldnt get it again .
awesome .
worst service ever the guys stand back there finding things to do so they can ignore customers and the line can grow really long they suck and the pizza isnt that great .
one of my favorite places to dine on the ues great atmosphere i love dining in back delicious homemade pasta reasonable prices good but not great service .
why do i not feel like all the other yelpers i think i set my expectations for this pizza the artichoke slice way too high and my first bite was just .
one of my favorite italian spots in the city love the ambiance service menu and quality of food best of all its very well priced super good food local guests fantastic atmosphere and really really really good food and wines def a must go .
i would rather go to papa johns pizza .
ive been here twice which in nyc is high praise carboload outside .
just had an artichoke slice that was well below par when its good its great but if the staff cant be bothered to reheat it properly its like eating a slice of stale cheesy bread .
please add gluten free options its not difficult to carry gluten free pasta in the kitchen i come here a lot but since ive been diagnosed with a gluten allergy i find it harder to order food here .
fell for the hype but didnt like it i didnt get the artichoke slice got the margarita was pretty bad will try the artichoke next time but ttill on the hunt for manhattans best slice .
omg so so good glad i listened to yelpers and ordered the gnocchi it was the best i ever had service is really good and so is the atmosphere here def recommend this place the scallops are also wonderful .
disgusting this pizza is so wrong it tastes like the canned alfredo sauce i once used when i was 15 years old disgustingly salty and creamy the fact that this is so popular lowers my opinion of humanity .
neighborhood gem one of the fun places for good italian food great desserts on the ues highly recommended .
overhyped i waited about 1520 mins on line to get pizza that did not please my tastebuds i tried the crab and sicilian crab was bland unique but nothing special and the sicilian was tasty although the crust was tough and chewy id rather go to 2 bros .
had the gnocchi ricotta and they were amazing i went alone as i am on a business trip so i sat in the lounge area i got great service and never felt awkward .
i honestly dont know what the hype over this place is about big slice but overpriced and way way messy dripping with mayo or whatever the hell that white sauce is .
i had a great birthday dinner here we sat outside in the patio garden area and it was lovely the service is excellent food delicious and ambiance fantastic .
so its artichoke dip on top of pizza not very good for my stomach wait was to long too .
always have a great experience at uva one of the best italian restaurants in the ues by far and with a young vibe .
maybe i got the wrong kind of slice i had all the prereqs some drinks some late night sillies my sister in tow but alas the artichoke spinach pizza was nothing to get crazy over it tasted like lackluster spinachart dip on a doughy bread next .
perfect for nice evening dinner both food and wine are good kitchen is serving full menu till 2am and they have a nice beautiful patio in the back .
ehhh toppings are quite good but afterthought crust is just a bowl in pizza mecca .
amazing great interior great food you should try there bottle water from italy .
major barf do i really want to wait 30 minutes for a thick toochewy slice of dough sloshed with artichoke dip maybe this appeals to other people but id rather get a slice anywhere else .
great experience went there on a saturday night food is excellent service is very good really had a good time would definitely go back make sure you get a reservation as it gets packed pretty quickly .
artichoke shmartichoke if you like waiting forever for so so pizza served up too hot and with a lot of attitude then this place is for you and that lurch robot guy in the front needs to get a life .
i cant even get into depth about my love affair with uva i just dont have adequate time i will update later but uva is my go to wine bar italian restaurant in the upper east side in love .
uberpop pizza the crab slice was the best of the bunch budweiser big gulp was fun allinall not worth the wait .
not good for a first date if you want to talk so freaking loud but food was amazing goat cheese appetizer stuffed eggplant beets gnocchi great flavor i will be back to try other menu items for sure .
this place use to be good they decided to charge more no problem but then they started to burn the pizza and started to skimp on ingredients .
great ambiance food and service get there early and wait for a table in the outside backyard garden ues gem .
save yourself some time and money just go to a bodega and buy a gallon of oil then chug it .
cute little place i love the pastas here and service is good i come here often with my family and we always enjoy it .
went back to try the artichoke slice because i didnt have it the first time meh tasted like artichoke dip on really really really thick and chewy pizza .
great ambience good food good service enjoyed the artichoke salad and penne pasta with mushrooms surely one of the better italian restaurant in ny .
the artichoke tastes like campbells soup on a pizza .
great atmosphere and the gnocchi was light and refreshing though my acquaintance had the eggplant and said that it made her feel sick the service staff was great and attentive would definitely go back .
man you can kiss my patoot i aint waitin in line for that shit .
i ordered shrimp with roasted peppers shrimp was cooked to perfection my husband had an eggplant for an appetizer and he loved it portions are small so you definitely need an appetizer the dessert was the best part of the meal overall i would recommend this place .
nevermind .
5 stars for food and service we sat in the back in the garden so it was not as dark and cramped feeling as inside only drawback was having to exit through the very crowded bar scene definitely a place to return to .
every time i get delivery from here i am always disappointed items are always missing or incorrect and they refuse to offer a refund letdown .
prosciuttos awesome pasta and veal were great the seafood was not fresh .
this was not great which is funny bc the kotos in plattsburgh ny is the sushi was good but the hibachi dishes were over cooked scallops were terrible so rubbery steak was also a bit overdone go somewhere else .
an amazing wine bar italian restaurant i always sit in the covered patio in the back or the wine cellar downstairs get the truffle cheese and flatbread appetizeri forgot what its called but it just reeks of truffles beautiful crowd and staff .
tableside chefs make up for slow service odd ambience and needless expense almost .
really really really good get the gnocchi i usually hate gnocchi but this was mindblowing also anything with truffles truffle oil is going to send you home happy .
awful just awful dry bland protein soggy overdressed salad everything cooked on hibachi tasted the same like rancid oil just a terrible meal .
the food is suprisingly good wait staff not so much but i guess you cant have it all this is s agod date place and a good girls night out start place .
not very cheap 5 25 tax for a falafel sandwich for a falafel really much cheaper options available in this area will be going elsewhere for falafels .
very nice food and atmosphere vibrant on most nights and never too overcrowded .
got takeout from this place the chicken burrito was large but very bland guacamole had too much bitter red onion in it set your food expectations to low too bad too as there is definitely a need for a good mexican place on staten island .
excellent pappardelle with veal ragu good fettucini with shrimp and zucchini though not as flavorful as the pappardelle beet salad with goat cheese and fava beans was great great date spot .
if at first you dont succeed try and try again well i did food still sucks great place to go if youre teenybopper looking to hang out and drink .
great outdoor area in the back and they have this whole charming drinking wine from a ceramic bowl thing going on theyre small drinksized bowls give it a try definitely one of my favorite spots on the upper east .
somebody pulled the chain and this place is going down the toilet where it belongs it may look like a nice place now that they redid it but its like putting a silk hat on a pig its still a shitty animal .
nice ambiance good food .
the food sucks the sangria tastes horrible how can one possibly screw up sangria the bouncer at the door is a dick avoid ever going here .
uva is one of my favorite spots in nyc go for the flight wine specials its worth the money and makes for some great conversation .
if you like food poison this is the place to get it .
uva definitely scores a homerun great service great food and overall a pleasant experience .
avoid this restaurant at all costs pros not much except burrito was average enough cons dark atmosphere bouncy tables my mom had a chicken salad that tasted like purdue frozen chicken loud music basically everything was terrible about this restaurant .
second time just as good as the first 5 stars all the way .
much of the staff is rude and egotistical the food and drinks are way over priced music is played to loud out of all the bars on the forest ave i would rank this one last .
polenta with the black truffle sauce is to die for .
terrible experience service is really bad and food equally bad we got really disappointed .
best italian place so far in nyc great wine recommendation and superb food and we have been to a lot .
this place is sub par the food is tasteless walk a couple of blocks and go to spice for some real thai dishes .
went thanks a to yelp review something i dont often do and liked it they let us stay forever and the food was good .
dont believe the hype bland food all around .
great italian pasta and food had a great dinner when i arrived from my trip i let my daughter order for all of us since she has had food from them before great service i loved everything about this place .
horrible service mediocre fd .
uva is a goto everything is delicious and moderately priced it can get loud but the atmosphere is great for a date the garden in the back is lovely you really cant go wrong here enjoy .
worst thai food ever and the half portion of chicken i got could only have come from some mutant hormone filled freak it was so enormous and fatty i suspect they use monsanto chickens i will not be going back .
this place is amazing its romantic and delicious we got the scallops and the eggplant appetizer and the short ribs the eggplant was the best but everything was amazing definite recommend .
food is aite nothing to rave about the service however is horrendous dont expect to strike any kind of decent convo about the food menu options or asking for that rice doesnt crack your teeth delivery is probably a nice compromise .
best italian restaurant in the ues from tasty bruschetta appetizers to dense chocolate mousses accompanied with some great wine the restaurant is wonderfully decorated chandeliers exposed brick salvaged wood best part is they serve food till 2am new fave ues spot .
i had the curry puffs and the pad gra prow with tofu the curry puffs were awful the pastry wasnt crisp and flaky as it should be the filling was weird and off pad gra prow was bland it tasted like frozen stirfry .
it a great date spot great wine list nice setting very reasonable priced i just sat at the bar .
cuban sandwich isnt nice at all they appear to have used sweet pickles and it is far too sweet the other plates taste alright but far too small .
unique menu compared to other italian restaurants fast service watch out that we went at 5 in the afternoon the pasta entrees are good enough for one but could also be shared the veal was small the soda bottles were very small 250ml .
garbage .
my goto italian restaurant in the ues delicious reasonably priced food and fantastic service my favorites are the red beet gnocchi and pappardelle with ragu a touch on the heavysalty side but overall would highly recommend .
food is not that good and it seems to be sitting out there under the heat lamps for awhile went mid week so perhaps during the busier weekend days the food is fresher .
the food was good they serve bread that is so good the customer service was very fast i was with mom and they realize she speaks spanish so they designate a spanish speaker waitress .
honestly i have found wayy better buffets but fun has pretty good seafood all in all i just wish they had a fresher selection of selections .
the red fingerling potato gnocchi was out of this world amazing highly recommend .
what a dump bad service all the way around took half an hour to place an order for a togo cup of coffee fish looks and smells far from fresh schizophrenic indecision between being a coffeehouse and a sushi joint allaround failure in a neighborhood of bad options .
my go to dinner spot on the ues resonably priced nice ambience and most importantly delicious italian food my favorite dishes are the burrata cheese and truffle gnocchi .
never will be returning to this hipster hangout i guess the owner and the hipster dont mind the unclean bar and employees wont ever return to this dive .
wonderful food great wine selection and reasonable prices i am never disappointed and would highly recommend .
wow it couldnt have been worse go in order a drink and get a side of douche for free not again .
nice place eat out seat .
after a couple more conversations on the phone i finally got my refund for the extra charge sloppy but at least they care about customer service .
it gets packed and they dont take reservations for small groups but the food is worth it get the scallops youre welcome .
theres a vintage typewriter in the bathroom if youre into preposterous shit like that .
im a fan delicious italian food in upper east side .
the prime rib was terrible .
uva is a great mix of ambiance food and service i like to sit by the bar where the action is happening try the artichoke salad bruschetta signature gnocchi with truffle oil and speck taleggio wines by the glass are great ask the bartender for recommendation .
what a disappointing experience service was bad and the food was ok ive been there twice hoping that the second time will be better but no change i definitely will not recommend this place .
noisy but quality food an service sit in the covered garden .
really standard american food nothing creative nothing unexpected not what id pay high prices for .
one of my favorite ues restaurants amazing wine list try the lambrusco exceptional food try the burrata and the pappardelle with veal ragu great serviceatmosphere love this place .
lived in philly my whole life stingiest drink i have ever ever had bartenders so unfriendly would never go back again .
the food was good the mushroom bruschetta and the artichoke pizza was excellent in appetizers the pastas were fantastic too .
yelp should have a food poisoning clickbutton avoid the burger unless you enjoy throwing up .
uva has very fresh ingredients and a wonderful atmosphere for a date or group meal crostinis are awesome and reasonably priced most of the menu is also a good deal for the quality of food .
delicious food .
really good gnochi and pasta wine is great too i had an amazing dinner with some friends here .
i was very excited to try this restaurant however it fell short of expectations the highlight was the service which was phenomenal but otherwise the restaurant was gilded the experience does not meet the mien and the food fell short of pretense .
love this place went last night for the first time we were greeted immediately sat immediately and our waiter came to our table almost immediately service couldnt have been better our waiter was awesome and we had a fabulous and very indulgent dinner .
this place is never open with its intended hours i was told if they are slow the close early ive gone there twice and they were slow so the were closed hours are advertised but they apparently open and close whenever they feel like it .
salmon was great portion was right for the price accommodated me despite being an hour late for my res .
was so excited by all the reviews but ive had better frozen pizza i hate leaving bad reviews so i will say the crust was nice that was about it .
amazing all around the ricotta truffle bruschetta is amazing as is the gnocchithey know how to do it right the wine list and service was impeccable as well highly recommended .
delivered wrong pie irregardless the pie looked like it came from pizza hut .
such a charming little restaurant and brunch was soooo good bianca omelette with addictive crunchy little potato cubes and a sausage coil followed by a mimosa yum .
had lunch here spicy salmon spicy shrimp and crab salmon avocado pretty mediocre sushi though inexpensive didnt try hot food .
second stop here for dinner and it was great again service was great and we both loved the back seating area .
very very small portion but at least it is fresh i have tasted better so wont be coming back .
great food get there before 7 to enjoy the wine flights .
for new years day there was nothing open so we ended up at bea it turns out that food is not bad and the srvice is good i wouldnt make a trip to come back but its decent .
good atmosphere it was crowded but the service was still great the octopus appetizer we had was a bit expensive 14 but very good the gnocchi entree was also delish .
made reservations service was horrible food was ok i got up twice to try to get our table water not good .
great italian spot in ues everything was fresh good wine selection good service good for groups has room .
the food here was really good but the service was lacking it was fairly empty and yet it took a while for our food to come and getting the check took even longer overall not all that impressive .
great service beautiful ambience good food great wine list brought my girl here for her birthday and it was great very busy a bit noisy and cramped but a beautiful space must have the polenta it was to die for .
i loved this coffee shop until i paid 10 for a cup of coffee and toast with avocado and no wifi on the weekends i understand the limited space problem but if youre not going to offer wifi dont charge that much for a meal thats worth 5 .
uva yesa .
a lot of puertorican but the food is not that goog .
uva was delic i had the salmon it was excellent and the brushetta menu was great .
ive decided to give them a try again i havent been here for 8 years i was a little disappointed the place was dirty the food was just ok and at 6pm they were out of beans and red rice the staff were careless and looked miserable .
amazing food good service great prices .
not a huge fan i would call this place commercial puerto rican food at best its quantity versus quality this place is the known place in philadelphia for puerto rican food but im convinced there has to be something better .
love this place goto .
the price was good but the food was not we ordered at 417 on a thurs and didnt get the food until 530 by the time we got it it was not even warm the ironic part we didnt even get a fortune cookie .
great place very classic and trendy great wines definitely recommend it .
this is my first time to experience a vietnamese cuisine and i have to say its not my cup of tea i had the beef deluxe pho the portion size was quite substantial but tasteless our server was not super friendly too i would say it is average .
wow joel bartender was great food great atmosphere fun and festive .
ugggg i hate this place its so dirty and the food is def not the best in philly ill go to the market and then drive to chinatown to eat because its so ratchet .
great great great spot order the truffle cheese and scallops .

great staff and food late night date had a great time .
yikes walked in and walked out last night the entire doorway area was so gross it looked like someone hadnt swept in weeks food particles trash dirty foot prints if a doorway looks like that what does the kitchen look like really disappointing .
great upscale italian food in a very cool restaurant love the indoor garden area in the back .
its alright it just doesnt compare to to vietnam in chinatown at all .
quant rear patio great service very good food .
food options were crap had one drink and left they are trying too hard and not succedding in my opinion .
chic priced right good service nice date restaurant .
great atmosphere but thats just about it in order to see the menu you have to stand over people and look at it on the wall also not very impressed with choices on the menu .
great food great place .
i used to like this place but got tired of the surly elitist entitled attitude of the people who work there plus the no paper menu no tv schtick is old and tired its a big city go to the green rock tavern or kelliannes instead .
great food and service the mozzarella is to die for hubby didnt love the veal ragu but i had the special gnocchi which was great well definitely go back .
cool atmosphere but the bartenders were to preoccupied taking shots to serve me and my friends will not returning .
the food was fabulous the waitress was friendly and helpful suggesting wines and food choices we felt like we were back in italy it was rather noisy but it was a friday night after work so it was not unexpected we will definitely go back .

great food weak service would definitely go back andor recommend it .
the beer list is great and the food is decent but the service is dreadful consistently slow inattentive wait staff with no attention to detail long wait for food dont even bother if youre with a large party its too much for them to handle .
love the place it has cute back garden food is delicious will be back .
typical italian menu food was only fair eventho it was crowed in the restaurant .
the food was incredible the service was amazing and the wine was incredible the bartender also told us a dirty joke and who doesnt love one of those cant wait to go back .
this place just below par lasagna was extremely oily salad had many brown pieces lamb portion was very small .
my wife and i love this restaurant its a wine bar with very good food sometimes its a bit loud and dark but the food service and drinks make up for it i recommend this place for a date .
ive had better taiwanese food before pork cutlet was literally the thinnest piece of pork ever w breading nothing special here .
awesome pizza at 1am .
compared to the other rodizio restaurants in the area this one is very ehhh the meats were over cooked and the salad bar was very bare i would go elsewhere .
love this place it s open until late hours the food is delicious my favorite dish is the beet gnocchi the wine list is great as well .
just started school at nyu and found this little spot it was blaaaah the jambalaya was okay but the waitress said it was pre made when i asked for no sausage the cornbread was ok but ive had better i wouldnt come here again though sorry .
have been going there since last year always great service excellent food love the staffs highly recommending .
menu is constrained to times house fries werent very tasty served cold i wish i was able to try their dinner menu but it didnt start until 5 and we went at 4 and the most appetizing thing we could try is pancakes .
this place never disappoints i have been there many times and each time is a rediscovery .
jambalaya was a disappointment it was a pile of brown mush with pieces of chicken and sausage corn bread was great dont waste your money on the cornmeal fried catfish it was crunchy but bland especially for 18 00 good beers on draught .
good food good service long waiting during the week .
poor service they forgot about us and served two parties that came after us not a fun way to start brunch food was decent but not good enough to overcome the poor service .
love the wine list riesling is my favorite the outdoor section is really nice in the warm weather great place to have cocktails and appetizers .
came here for brunch the service was terrible i literally had to get up and get menus for myself because i was sick of waiving my arms at the inattentive staff the food was completely mediocre huge portions of very bland tasting omelet not worth going back to .
this is my favorite italian restaurant in the city the food and wine is always great and the atmosphere as well as the service is never disappointing .
if i could this place a 0 i would it is over priced nonauthentic mexican food i went in for 3 carne asada tacos the total was 11 50 no rice or beans just 3 small tacos i will never be returning i highly recommend la veracruzana .
such delicious food i loved the service the waitress was nice and had a pleasant smile the place was crowded and so many happy people the mood was right and the weather today was so beautiful must visit .
this place is nice and clean but lo siento the beef tacos had zero seasoning it was plain ground beef it did not seem authentico .
my favorite gnocchi place in ny so far always great food cute environment if its warm seat on the patio in the back it will feel like you are in italy really nice this is one of the places i come as often as i can .
decent food unfortunately be prepared for it to be cold and have to wait over an hour and a half for delivery .
really yummy food and not the usual italian great wines by the glass and staff is better than you would expect a fantastic neighborhood find and reasonably priced .
there is a single table in this restaurant there is a single hole in the floor the hole is the size of a single chair leg this place gets a single star .
quality of the food was great had a delicious short rib dish extremely well cooked nice place to take a date as its not formal but classy enough that its a nice time .
friendly server food was honestly terrible not sure how this place gets any good reviews for the food it was all cheddarjack on a tortilla definitely not mexican food pretty darn nasty actually .
fantastic italian food service is very friendly and attentive there can be a wait but totally worth it gnocchi with black truffles was orgasmic .
horrible service very dirty gee what else can i say the food was extra greasy and my mom found an expired pandesal i told my fam to never go to this place ever .
awesome food nice atmosphere real gem .
two stars for the cheap drink prices and wide range of the hours their open very good ribbs on wedthurs only old man bar aweful bartenders the absolute worst and cult like crowd go to the town pub down the street .
so ridiculously good amazing wine atmosphere service and food thank you x .
give it one star went for the ribs but being i wasnt friends with the bartender had to wait 45 min for half rack of cold ribs and slimy fries wont get me again .
one word gnocchi phenomenal italian .
their food is okchicken teriyaki was just fried chicken decked with teriyaki sauce will not come back again .
this place is really a gem its a bit of a hike if you dont reside on the upper east but i keep making the trek for the excellent wine terrific service and really quite outstanding food try the truffle gnocchi its off the charts .
unfortunately sushi are not fresh and it smells bad staff are not friendly but i can deal with it if sushi were good worst sushi ever im surprised people are still eating there .
great italian restaurant with good food and service nice decor inside and great place for a date ive been twice now and everything ordered has been good .
great salad that comes with meals i ordered vegetable tempura but the broccoli wasnt cooked inside and flour was still white oh well the salad was great .
awesome selection of local italian wines from small villages and great menu both for vegetarian and nonvegetarian must recommended on upper east side the ambience is too good specially at the back make reservations for sure .
terrible service and rude staff unclean premises lead to food poisoning i wont be setting foot in the store again as i am extremely disappointed by the complete lack of respect and distrust that the chefs and staff aspire to .
delicious friendly service great food i love a brunch menu that has something for everyone if i lived on the ues this is where id always meet friends .
if you like big servings of cheap sushi with a side of indigestion sakura express is for you it smells funky formaldehyde both inside outside of the restaurant but is popular with anyone who equates cheap big with good ie most americans i couldnt finish my lunch order .
had the ravioli meatball special which was delicious friendly waitstaff comfortably ambience would recommend for good italian food and a date .
this place is cheap but gross the salad bar looks like its been sitting there all day and the dressing had a funny taste to it the chicken teriyaki is too sweet and sticky .
one word spectacular mouth watering most definitely coming back here for a date with my boyfriend .
large pieces but not great quality there is always a foul smell inside this place better options exist within walking distance .
delicious and amazing try the truffle flatbread and amazing prosciutto raviolis in pink sauce .
everything is overly salted disappointed .
its good italian you dont fell robed and caters for all recommend 1 pasta dish for 2 and a bunch of their primis best to go in winter i reckon has that cozy feel before you hit the bars .
sadly this is one of the bad thai places ive been to the food is just not very authentic .
great food great wine selection awesome atmosphere .
they let random people in there without children .
amazing just ask for massi he really runs the shows smoothly great place the food is good and the wine list is amazing the ambiance is very romantic bring your loved one so good .
maybe just not a fan of ethiopian food but the bar was nice the ppl that work there are nice and it has a very chill vibe there .
cozy atmosphere great food and wine the waitress was very attentive love this place .
exactly what margarita t said you nailed it girl not much more to say well for varietys sake ill add that i was held on the phone for 15 mins when ordering then disconnected and the portions are meant for a baby .
an obvious local favorite ive enjoyed everything ive gotten here the calamari and tiramisu are personal picks .
era has a new cook and the quality definitely is not as good the portions were smaller the meat dishes were looser i just got an ethiopian cookbook so i might start replicating dishes at home .
the food and wine were excellent here there was a nice ambience and the waitstaff were nice and attentive i will definitely go back .
to the surly eyerolling guy checking ids at the door saturday night 118 get over yourself and rethink the life choices that made you so miserable .
fun little wine bar on the ues the food is good too the service eh they need to work on it .
ok at best line is hideously long service is patchy food is ok good lively atmosphere other than that i cant think of many positives to say unfortunately .
i went here for my one year anniversary this weekend the food was so fresh and awesome servings arent huge but they are filling there is a wine for everyone and the mozzarella and fresh prosciutto appetizer is awesome def recommend .
overrated overhyped and worst of way over priced the food is good but not great the atmosphere is yardsalehipsterchic for the amount it costs to eat and drink here i shouldnt have to serve myself and sit on crappy used furniture .
great food place is really nice and romantic portion sizes are a little small for what you pay for but overall good tasting food and service .
best thing about the restaurant is the outdoor seating brisket fatty and bland food very expensive and sides nothing to write home about will stick with my local bbq baracoa much better in every way .
amazing highly recommended .
the meat is ok but expensive the sides are not worth it i have heard good things about this place before i went but was disappointed the place is cool inside but really that is it try bubbas texas bbq on gerrard instead its much better .
great for brunch too excellent frittata options highly recommended .
i would have rated fette sau higher but in truth it was just okay granted the interior is super hip and cool but the price was rather high for standard bbq fare the beans were undercooked and overall i was underwhelmed by my experience .
cool upper east side wine bar ive been there a few times with both small and large parties really fun atmosphere and tasty food .
the service was sloppy the lomo saltado were overcoked and my fries undercoked the ceviche portion was ridiculous not great the chickenwas way to crisp no very moist who knows when it was cooked food really lacked the saturday evening we dined .
incredibly nice staff and delicious food nice wines as well the truffle oil honey and goat cheese bruschetta was absolutely delicious .
horrible service we waited an 1 hr and 30 mins noone ask if we would like a drink of water the service is the worst im actually standing in the small waiting area and the waiter does not know what is going on horrible horrible horrible service .
my favorite ues italian restaurant and one of my favorite italian restaurants in general great wine list and all the pasta dishes are excellent the appetizers are always amazing as are the cheeses .
puleassssssse this place is basically the staple soul food spot for the hipsters in the city they dont even offer peach cobbler on the menu seriously them and smoke joint must be one in the same yuk .
always delicious wine and food and beyond stellar service phil is wonderful and very accommodating to everyone been here many times and its always enjoyable .
mediocre breakfast you could make the same thing at home really .
very nice wine bar great crowd food is very good with reasonable prices we ate in the back outdoor garden .
slow service hot food came out cold .
been here many times and the food is always excellent some highlights are bruschetta with sheeps milk ricotta and truffle honey and all gnocci dishes .
watched a mouse run across the floor after that we asked for the check and left immediately .
love the ambiance dimly lit nice decor romantic cozy great wine selection and delicious italian dishes .
the grits were a bowl of butter just butter other than that the food was just ok nothing spectacular the bar area looked like where it was happening next time im coming solo and sitting at the bar .
great wine bar but very pricey .
definitely got food poisoning from the chicken here worst night of my life other than that i used to roll with peaches just be careful .
i love this spot the dim lights fire place cozy little spots love their wines its the best place for a romantic date .
10 dollar minimum on credit cards dont go here if you just want one late night drink before bed or if you do you better have cash bartender maybe says 2 words to you also the pour on my guiness was pretty terrible .
solid service was great the options of bites bar were great and as well as the food items enjoyed that evening i liked the full bar beer selection and the wine list is dynamite will be going back .
the food was great the service could be better you have to wait a while to get drink order in can be crowded before a show at nj pac across the street .
really enjoyed this place lovely outdoor place good service decent food my friend and i simply had a few bites will be back .
who serves frozen vegetables with a 30 filet mignon if they arent frozen they taste like they are blah .
i adore uva its beyond amazing great ambiance for a romantic evening or drinks with a girlfriend great wine amazing food who doesnt want gnocchi in truffle oil i may not live on the ues anymore but i will always travel for uva .
nico keeps calling me every few days they call two to three times in a row desperate ineffective nico cafeteria should have better things to do like improving service and quality a truly useless establishment .
so pretty food yummmm gnocchi di rocotta to die for creamy and melts in ur mouth heavenly mezze lune alla boscaiola crazy chocolate salami perfect end to the evening .
wanted just a salad they were only serving fixed price .
i love this wine bar its cute and cozy and theres a large wine selection priced pretty decently as well .
i try the order but man who answer the phone is rude and hung up on me i dont understand how come they hung up before you talk about food and price you better nice to your customers .
cheese good with abundant selection antipasti good portions are just right able to try multiple entree good flavorful and large enough to share pasta looked good peeked at our neighbors service good and nonpushy atmosphere good very cozy and elegant yes that about sums it up .
terrible service the server refused to serve appetizers on our plates when we asked for serving he simply said we dont give that kind of service the attitude from the server and manager ruined our birthday celebrations .
a good solid pick for italian on the ues the servers and bar staff are friendly understanding and attentive .
pros interior decoration lighting of the place is really good food is below average service is good cons utensils glasses plates are not clean food is too oily and greasy the meat had no taste tasted extremely refrigerated .
i have now been here too many times to count and it never disappoints and i mean never the food ambiance wait staff wine and prices are incredible i love uva .
it is an ok restaurant too much decoration and furniture food is ok variety is good staff is not very courteous .
outstanding place had a lamb shank that was delicious their wine seleciton is off the hook our waitress was litte unfriendly but maybe she was having a bad night hey we are all human besides that it was perfect .
horrible attitude stay away from this pretentious hipster joint .
great restaurant thanks yelpers for the tip if youre in the neighborhood give it a try youll not be disappointed .
2nd time ive come here during their hours of operation and theyre closed they also never ever answer the phone im starting to think you have to be part of a secret society to eat here .
more like 4 5 awesome place great wines one of the best gnocchis i have ever tasted vast selection of cheeses and bruschettas deserts were very average very good pricing and service this place is a must try .
i always hear good things about this place but ive been here twice and each time the service was strange or slow and the food is always way too salty .
great wine selection and awesome vibe staff is very knowledgeable and helpful great upper east side spot .
i wouldnt come back to unprofessional waiting staffs just for an average food after the food was served the waiter disappeared and the bus boy asked to box the food every five minutes this continued for about ten more times we felt harrassed a bit .
hands down the best food ive found in the upper east side this past year since moving here great wine list and definately try the paparadelle with veal ragu smart rustic ambience great spot for intimate conversation or to just hang out with a group of friends unbeatable .
not recommended its a pleasant enough place but the food isnt authentic nor does it seem to be made with care nothing is disgusting its just not very good and overpriced for what you get dont get a sazerac .
awesome pillowy truffled gnocchi chicken salad was great too though kind of random for an italian place meatballs were nice and the tomato sauce they were in was spot on also liked the fabulous fruity olive oil they brought to the table .
confused about all the rave reviews for sugarfreak we drove out from ct to experience all that this place had to offer leaving disappointed .
dim lighting xoxoxo the food was pretty good its really inexpensive filled up on bread with oil n vinegar delish waiter was hot too had a nice time here was seating quickly .
i dont know why this place gets good reviews but i thought it was mediocre at best the only thing i enjoyed were the drinks and they were 60 ice this place is truly nothing special .
very cosy and romantic nice music excellent choice of wines and awesome food very tasty original i recommend red beet gnoci ideal place for date a little pricy but worth it .
first time here nice atmosphere friendly staff not impressed with brunch overly seasoned vegetarian sandwich ive heard good things though so ill try it again another time .
beed carpaccio is the best as well as other appetizers main course was okay .
this place was cute and friendly but i could have made most of the dishes at home .
wine is great here great selection and cheese tray w fruit is delish good for a few glasses of wine and app or dinner highly recommend this spot wait staff is also friendly must have the truffle cheese and parmesano .
the staff is nice but the food is blah to the extreme not disgusting just absolutely blah im pretty sure my shrimp were frozen plus they were out of biscuits and they didnt offer to replace it with anything felt ripped off .
great date spot in the ues the place is cute and the decor is simple but nice i highly recommend trying the parmesan truffle gnocchi delicious and absolutely one of my fav dishes great wine selection as well .
atmosphere is really cool brunch was decent one complimentary mimosa or bloody mary w brunch entree service was friendly but rarely seen overall i dont believe i would return except for maybe one of their excellent abita beer selections on tap .
ate at this place last night and everything was delicious i loved the appetizer entree and dessert definitely a place to go to on a date but not a first date because the place gets extremely loud .
ordered the half chicken poboy it was terrible hardly edible and the fries were maybe the worst fries ive ever had ive been in nyc for almost 2 years and this was probably the worst food ive had so far definitely do not recommend .
great food the duck was so good and the wine was a great price good food for a great price .
dry chicken shawarma and bland maybe it was a bad day but definitely not coming back .
the ambiance was great the waitstaff was perfectly attentive the food was oh boi it is a great place to take a girl for a 1st date guys .
this is average to below average middle eastern food the falafel does not have much flavor pita bread isnt fresh the salads are not great its popular bc its cheap and open late i also recently had the chicken kabob and it tasted like gas from the grill .
amazing took my girlfriend here for her birthday and she loved it great atmosphere great food and great service .
sad colorless falafels loaded with fillers falafel salad selection is sparse the options being iceberg red cabbage stale hummus and sliced pickles its 6 but quality ensures less .
tiny but great date spot typical cute wine bar with a very warm and friendly vibe it can get crowed since its small so be sure to go on an off timeday to get a table great winescheeses .
yelp summed it up for me perfectly meh ive experienced better the food was average at best the atmosphere felt dirty the service was meh i live 2 blocks away and i doubt ill be back .
great wine list one of the few places i know that serve lambrusco love the fried artichoke cool romantic atmosphere .
completely unimpressed im middle eastern and i know whats good m e food this was atrocious if you are looking for better and cheap middle eastern turkish fare then id go to doner around the corner on bedford ave .
my favorite italian restaurant love the ambiance great wines yummy pastas try the truffle gnocchi at least once very rich but ive never tasted anything like it great datesmall group spot highly recommend .
very short menu very crowded plenty of wine choices but 300 for 4 people on avenue c i dunno i just dont see it .
havent been here in a long time but from what i remember this place is excellent the wine selection cheese platters and service are fantastic must go back .
horrible experience 2 hours later still didnt receive main courses left with to go bags will not be returning .
great food and wine very afordable very consistantly good good service owner and maitred are always on the floor .
ridiculous i would review the food but ive been waiting 2 hours to sit the bartending is at an equally slow pace so perhaps its appropriate do not come if you are hungry or thirsty .
i love uva especially when you can sit out back in their courtyard and drink wine all night there open until 2am which is great too the food is great if you dont mind the wait time .
good wine great beer only ok food way overpriced and too much hype for nothing much .
i cant say enough good things about uva been here on dates girls night out you name it ive never had a bad experience wine suggestions are always spot on gnocci is delicious had a sundried tomato gnocci once on special amazing a total gem in the neighborhood .
ate at the bar the guy didnt put our main entree order in then blamed us for not seeing us finish our app lame .
mmm i love uva the place is dimly lim and romantic great wine selection and the food is delicious they have probably the best bruschetta ive had in the city and the pasta is consistently good .
was super excited to come here because i love love asian sandwiches but sandwiches here were only okay thought i would enjoy it more but it was kind of bland and the bread wasnt as fluffy and yummy .
delicious adorable romantic garden in the back too loud inside but service food and wine were fantastic oh and the cheese plate yum .
­ ­ ­ ­ it was ard .
great date spot very dimly lit wine bar lots of wine and food gets very crowded on thursdays fridays and saturdays .
modern asian lets talk about the food its fancier chinese food with better ingredients and presentation ambiance modern asian its different service perfect non intrusive yet helpful its not the worst place you could eat .
lovely decor exposed brick soft lighting candles good service delicous food casualcomfortable ambiance very nice .
overrated and overpriced will not be going back .
this place gets my vote for one of the best wine bars on the upper east side the service is terrfic and the decor is over the top its a must top for great wine and impressive cheeses .
way over priced chinese food what do all my chinese people have to say about this .
wonderful restaurant the seating garden in the back is a welcome surprise uva has such an italian vineyard feel the food is wonderful and the wine impressive dont miss the chance to try this place you wont regret it .
it must be me greasy oily food and then theres the fried food well if you like fried oily food disguised as wholesome fresh well this is your place three tries youre outta here .
good bruchetta nice wine list cheeses grapes the crepes looked pretty good never had desert here romance factor 9 hobnob potential 5 destination rating 5 nice outdoor seating and friendly wait staff lovely place to lounge on a nice warm evening or late afternoon .
both of us got sick the same night food tasted good alright .
the food just keeps getting better carmelo is awesome please come here it deserves your attention the steak tartare and the pork wrapped fontina is fantastic .
positive delicious nonalcoholic drinks with extraordinary dessert in a fine dining restaurant negative small expensive portion sizes without the quality expected in a high end restaurant overall good place for a fine dining experience if you only want to have their nonalcoholic drinks with dessert .
excellent cuisine super friendly staff and very cozy atmosphere worth the trip even from manhattan .
it was not as good as advertised went with a co worker who had raved about this place but was embarrassed after dinner poor food good reception .
i love this place great friendly staff members and a warm atmosphere perfect for date night .
food is pf chang quality but tiny portions lemong garss sorbet was great amazing decor .
a hidden gem in the middle of astoria the waiting staff do a fantastic job of serving without ever intruding on your personal space the food is great very tasty without being overbearing the decor and layout is great we will definitely be back .
i didnt want to just take to yelp to complain about my experience i wrote to the restaurant using its website about a week before i wrote my update on yelp and have never heard back what a shame .
we celebrate this new restaurant with eating food and everything was excellent .
service was not so great dry pot not so great at all only plate good out of four was beef lo mein chicken was bland should have gone to amada .
the best italian food that you will find in astoria authentic scrumptious romantic the owners of vite clearly know what they are doing .
decor and all that yes it is very beautiful and trendy etc but they have maybe 23 vegetarian options not a fan of that spent a whole lot of money for a mediocre meal .
yeah finally i think this one will stick good prices good balance of flavors with some creativity havent had the pizza but apps and pastas are good pizza looks good .
played out asian theme check giant tacky budda check loud obnoxious douchebag clientele check why cant these asian clone restaurants pick one type of food and do it well as opposed to trying to do everything mediocre .
simply the best italian in astoria the owner is a nice guy who spends his nights looking after his guests when youll go make sure you try the porcini risotto .
the atmosphere of the restaurant was great but the food was not that impressive very americanized asian food nothing to look forward to too pricey for what it is .
i love the place the food is truly italian and the staff is friendly astoria needed a place like this i am so happy they finally opened because the prices are also really good .
ok hibachiwasnt amazed and didnt make me full not worth price .
really really tasty burger a nice place but feels like a tokyo johnny rockets that said burger fries and buns are top drawer recommended as a good basic place .
frog is gone and now urban outfitters inc urbn com nasdaq urbn manages this place it is the fanciest restaurant in the navy yard but it is inconsistent and overpriced also note that the seasoning on ethnic foods is always bland .
the spicy tuna burger and salmon volcano roll are really good the food was prepared quickly and the service was good .
good food but i overheard the owner speaking very rudely to an employee not ok also this is not the first time ive heard of this happening there no wonder they seem to have a new person at the register every time i go there never going back .
ordered a brown rice bowl with beef came out fast and tasted great the portion size is adequate and very tasty lots of veggies cooked in seems healthy .
coffee is four stars been in before and enjoyed the coffee today the service wow not sure if we will ever be back just awfully rude im sure it was an off day but damn .
spicy tuna burger yes youve heard it thats right all hail japanese meet american cuisine highly recommended you have to try it i bet you great food and friendly servers 4 stars .
my experience at effies was very disappointing the food was overcooked and dried out i had the misfortune of meeting the owner his conduct and the way that he runs his business is very unprofessional needless to say i wont be back .
delicious they gave me white rice instead of brown rice that i ordered it was even on the receipt but it wasnt a big deal still a really good lunch .
had the breakfast special wasnt that great felt like something i couldve made myself for the prices you arent getting what you pay for yes its a diner but i just expected more .
great .
ordered the baked apple dessert and thought it was just awful had it warmed since that was supposed to be preferred but the dough was almost raw and overall it was just to sweet and mushy not my thing .
absolutely phenomenal food and fast service great burgers and just tried their sushi today perfect lunch spot during work .
meh just very average for gluten free you cant get much more than eggs and bacon if you can eat gluten it might be a nice and cheap option .
i went there after work with my coworker i was craving for some sushi my friend had a ramen noodle which she said was good i had the shrimp tempura oooo myyy myyy never had it before it was delicious the place is cute .
very very disappointed i stood in line one weekend morning for the blueberry pancakes they were cooked with ridiculous amount of butter and then topped with another mound of butter the result a greasy cloyingly sweet mess that should not be on anyones brunch list will never return .
spicy tuna burger awesome spider roll and spicy tuna roll awesome had the green tea sandwich expected something a little better but still good .
the food is good but the service is very slow we were the only one in the resturant they messed up on our order we had to wait another 20 mins to get the other dish we ordered they forget to put another dish all together .
woooowwwwwwwww yeah that is all i have to say i love the burgers the bowls and especially the sushi oh i think i forgot to mention the sweet potato tempura fries yum .
came on a quiet night and service was friendly and efficient food was good and huge portions only let down was the rice as it was pure mush and cant believe that they decided to serve it mushy rice at a texmex restaurant is unacceptable .
i ordered the spicy tuna burger and tempura sweet potato fries my order came up quickly and it was delicious the restroom was also very clean even at the end of the lunchtime rush .
not so good i wont go back .
this place is great reminiscent of a japanese spin on fast food but the quality is anything but that i got a hearty meal of vegetables over brown rice with tofu for under ten bucks food tasted fresh came out quickly and they serve beer and sake .
friendly staff weak texmex posing as authentic mexican you can tell that the salsa it out of jar very disappointing margarita is pre mixed in a big igloo nothing easier to make than a margarita from scratch its also fairly expensive .
beef burger taste great especially w wasabi sauce next time want to try tuna tataki salad .
the food was meh service seemed irritable waffles with berry compote and whipped cream was overpriced especially after they served it to me and said they didnt have any more whipped cream wont be back .
great quick quality food and great prices pretty sure my husband had 1 of everything on the menu .
good backyard is nice rabbit pot pie was tasty looked nice inside but was packed bad wine is ridiculously overpriced and not especially great wine a bow tie doesnt make a snobby hipster with bad tattoos and no insightful wine knowledge a good waiter .
feels like it is healthy and tastes great better than fast food 13 gets plenty of grub for one .
small tables small plates good food big bill pleasant waitstaff found a hair in one of our lattes wont ever go again .
big fan of this place restaurant design is neutral bricks and wood no fluffy stuff it smells neutral as well no worry to smell fried fish when getting out very very affordable i particularly recommand the chicken bowl my favorite quick and cheap meal .
this place is gross i love fish and chips so i was thrilled when they moved in but this is like the mcdonalds of seafood friendly staff but yuck .
i really love the food taste is amazing the only bad part it can get very crowded .
took an hour and a half on a thursday to get my food was cold when i got it all the fish tasted of powder sugar could not eat most of the fish will not be ordering from them again .
seriously this place was outstanding rolls are on the big side of gigantic be ready to eat if you order more than one roll i thought the burgers looked great but didnt try this round reasonably price for dinner for two .
why the did yall move to down town people up town liked your place thanks for nothing .
im giving this place 4 stars because of the sweet potato tempura fries so good and crunchy the soft shell crab bun is good but the braised pork bun could use some more meat .
i expected the spring rolls to be fresh and not fried and the pad woonsen glass noodle dish was just not very flavorful i think i maybe ordered badly because a lot of people like this place .
i chose the spicy tuna burger and sweet potato tempura fries so much yum going on here .
overcharged my credit card management has refused to talk to me after multiple calls we used to get takeout from trio every week this meal was greasy and tasted horrible as well .
stopped in for a quick postmegabus dinner the concept is pretty cool think japanese chipotle and the food is tasty quick healthy and filling simple nononsense japanese food with a buzzer ill definitely be back to try their other offerings .
read the reviews and tried the place the food was subpar and pricey bums can make this food somethings up with these great reviews me thinks alcohol was involved .
best .
i went one night for dinner by myself and they refused to seat me will not support a place that refuses to serve me because i went alone such a horrible feeling to feel not wanted because you were a party of one .
i tried the shrimp tempura roll it was freshly made and tasted great the seaweed salad was also very good the service was fast friendly and efficient .
slow service menu outdated due to items no longer served leak in the ceiling is not cute and dripping on the table is not cute .
the teriyaki sweet potato fries to die for .
i will pass .
great place friendly service great selection kobe burger was amazing terrific variety and selection for many different tastes fresh food nice people have been back multiple times and never disappointed .
dont bother calling them for delivery im only 3 2 miles away and they told me im outside their delivery radius either theyre extremely stupid or dont actually want to make deliveries .
best tempura fries sushi and burgers .
i got excited to hear that a new soul food place is in jersey city despite the rough looking exterior we went in the older lady was very rude advice learn how to speak to customers bad attitude made us leave before the food came .
best quick japanese around i love everything tuna burger is amazing clean fast fresh doesnt get any better .
i dont know who wrote these past reviews but this place was just ok i got all excited about a soulfood spot in jc for nothing ive had way better food elsewhere only thing they serve really large drinks but i came to eat not drink .
definitely a fan of kobeyaki and will visit again just to have the udon soup great service and the atmosphere is like a cafeteria if you dont mind loudness .
i was told the food will take 20 minutes to get ready i only ordered cat fish nuggets and mac and cheese an hour passes and still no food catfish nuggets and mac and cheese were not worth the wait .
really nice tuna burger green tea ice cream sandwich was interesting fresh and good food .
once we entered maybe it was just that day or part of its charm the overwhelming stench of b o death came upon us in waves fantastic my brother now refer to it as that heroin bar because of how sketchy it looked inside .
near my hotel dream come true fast fresh with a deft hand even my noodle bowl was great i almost reached into the guy sitting next to mes fries please go national we need you .
awful terrible no good very bad bar bartender never looked at us maybe its because i wasnt wearing black we left and found another place nearby that was much better .
they wrap up their burgers so they look like cute asian buns i got the chicken teriyaki burger ive never had anything like it it was quite messy to eat but delicious i would definitely go back and try their other burgers .
the drinks are cheap here but no cheaper than other bars in the area they have lots of games like jenga and buck hunter perfect for the hipster kidults who seem to populate this place kinda corny and gimmicky free cheeseballs free cheeseballs indeed .
kobe burger and spicy rolls are awesome little expensive for everyday lunch but still having this all the time now i am broke .
we came here last night for a few drinks we had one round and then immediately exited overcrowded obnoxious patrons overcrowded obnoxious patrons overcrowded not my cup of tea umm no thanks .
i got a burger at brgr right next to kobeyaki it was so disappointing that i threw it away half way through and went on got a good burger from here much better very unique flavor .
this place used to be called kokies and you could wander in and buy cocaine from a guy sitting behind a door in what looked like broom closet now patrons play jenga .
small place good for lunch udon noodles bowl with shrimps was great try the teriyaki ketchup and wasabi mayo staff very friendly .
what the hell possessed you to write in permanent marker no less random scribbles on my debit card seriously what the hell .
good ramen great burgers and pork buns and good sushi .
gimmicks cheese balls beer cozies 2 black label pinball big buck hunter im too old and antisocial for the shitshow this place is on the weekends though .
clean fast innovative fresh friendly good portions i ordered the spicy tuna burger every detail was perfected from the buns to the salad topping to the huge piece of tuna i need kobeyaki to expand .
went back last week husbands order was wrong again we were also in the mood for onion rings so got an order and meh what a disappointment such a bummer this spot used to be our jam .
i went back and tried their broiled sushi rolls and the spicy tuna burger these things are mad tasty i eat them once a month .
stuffed cabbage had more potato than meat string beans were mush and inedible beats were mush and weird i felt sick after my meal half of which i didnt eat the only good part was that the servers were friendly and welcoming .
kobeyaki is delicious and well prepared i ordered the vegetable bowl with brown rice which comes with tofu amazingly fresh and filling yum i wouldnt hesitate to come back .
definitely no frills i felt pretty stuffed afterward i didnt think the food was anything special very nice service though .
love it here the food is delicious and fresh a little pricey but i dont mind too much because its fast and yummy loooove the tuna tataki salad ginger dressing is fabulous d .
pretty decent food nothing to write home about i had been craving pierogies all day staff aint too friendly but i might come back after testing some other pierogi spots in the neighborhood .
i miss living half a block from kobeyaki aside from their delicious burgers and sweet potato fries their miso soup and sushi though limited in options is excellent and the portions are generous im a huge fan of the salmon volcano roll and spicy tuna roll .
frozen steak and stale bread welcome to cheesesteak sucksville population 1 there is another georges i believe famous georges in the italian market that does have a pretty good roast pork but i cant find it on yelp .
had a veg tofu rice bowl for lunch here one day so good and quick and the rest of their menu looks good too different types of burgers and sweet potato fries etc spicy mayo is goooood .
the service here is very disappointing we didnt get the usual show and the food was extremely salty i would not recommend this restaurant .
not the most authentic japanese food but really tasty sushi good location and food is served very quickly .
i decided to give this place another shot because i was nearby and wanted sushi i will not ever return the food is tolerable nothing spectacular but nothing terrible the service on the other hand is horrendous the hostess and servers look miserable and act miserable .
got off the megabus and was starving kobeyaki definitely came through and bonus for having alcohol not a place to go out of your way to eat but good to know its around .
came here on weekday for lunch based on yelp reviews in descending order yellowtail roll was fine salmon teriyaki was edible service was barely passable would likely not return .
a very solid addition to the neighborhood fresh tasty food and fast so far i have tried the soft shell crab burger and the rice bowls both have been great .
i tried pani puri and papdi chat here today and the qualitytaste was not good the water quantity wasnt enough for the the pani puri in a plate .
i must say its very tasty food here i tryed mostly bowls with beef and chicken and they all were great good value also contemporary design good food convenient location and fast service perfect lunch if you are in the area recommended .
tasty snacks very rude owner smaller mom n pop shops on the same street are a better bet .
still my favorite .
ugh .
best new york meal ive had this year paneer was great zucchini pizza was incredible duck portobello confit was rich and delicious but the pork dumplings with apricot chutney were the best going back next weekend .
i sat there for 15 minutes and didnt get served or even acknowledged by the bartender so i left .
this is such a unique place atmosphere is dark cozy and exotic menu is small and filled with spicy surprises like zucchini and hummus together on pizza and pickled ginger scallops our waitress was so kind and accommodating it was like midwest service in the big apple .
absolutely not .
great a small menu but every plate is quality id recommend the pork buns and paneer to anyone communal tables are a doubleedged sword but it appropriately adds to the atmosphere .
prices are decent enough but the food is mediocre even by bar standards plus the lunchtime bartender was pretty obnoxious .
its been a while since i ate here but i do remember it was really good a bit loud drunk girls yelling and crowded but staff was cool and accommodated us best they could food made everything better and chef came out and said hey nice .
went for lavish lunch buffet got there an hour after it started all the chafing dishes needed replenishing and they never did so annoyed might have lost me as customer they didnt even seem to be bothered by it .
everything about this place is wonderful including how small it is intimate cozy and colorful food here is an art we ordered basically everything from the menu a few items twice .
weirdly sweet chicken tikka not at all impressed and the naan is gross very disappointed .
unique ingredients amazing food my taste buds have orgasms .
worst thai food ever expensive and worst food yellow curry was rotten caution before going to this resturant .
thought the environment was odd at first but the food more than made up for it strange wonderful bites well done .
not too much to say the food just wasnt that good got the pad thai and it wasnt sweet enough there just wasnt enough flavor this place was really crowded and it was like 56 oclock on a friday not quite sure what the buzz was about .
came here a few weeks ago with some friends we had almost everything on the menu despite the small venue the chef packs a lot of flavor into all the food the pork dumplings and the eggplant buns i recommend .
food quality ranges from quite good to abysmal probably depending on who is cooking even the waitress warned me not to order the pad thai one day because it was a new cook stopped going because of several disappointing meals .
dont go if youre claustrophobic or do not like familystyle tables a tiny place with great service a tasty menu and a fun ambiance must try lychee martini and veggie burger sliders .
its ok but not great i tried the pad thai with tofu and the curry of the day with tofu the pad thai tasted bad and the curry was ok but the only veggies were carrots and a couple of peppers it really wasnt good at all .
really cool menu the flavors were a really cool fusion of spices and ingredients we tried the hummus pizza paneer burgers and each dish was more delicious than the next one drawback is that the place is really tiny good luck if youre over 6 feet .
they closed as i was walking up going to lunch at 315 on a saturday and didnt want to help me i drove across town to check them out but wasnt about to wait around 20 minutes so i took my unwanted cash to the italian market .
surprisingly good the first time i went last couple times are just okay but still decent and different memorable food and priced well love the pork tights tight seating had good wine usually can get a reservation last minute .
waited three hours for a table saw famous people ate disappointing sandwich all in all not a great experience .
what a great and unexpected find we started with the hummus pizza and loved every bite of each dish we ordered .
we waited one hour before getting a seat the brunch wasnt really good not tasty i dont think that i will come back .
the a la cart menu was delicious the best we had this ny visit service was very nice too check out this place for one of a kind fusion dining prepare to reserve some days upfront .
the burger didnt do much for me i did finish it though .
a unique and intimate experience that never fails to please food is like a mish mash of every taste youve ever had and always works amazingly how they turn out that quality of food from a kitchen that size is astounding .
generic food and very very loud .
one of the most memorable and delicious meals weve ever had in nyc the restaurant is very cozy the staff are inviting and knowledgeable the food is unique and phenomenal and we always look forward to what the chef will create next .
my daughter hated her dish and i thought mine was just ok the service is slow there are better places for lunch in nyc .
this place makes my taste buds happy that they ever existed come here order everything thank me later .
looked very good from the outside but i was disappointed my burger was terrible .
i love this place it is small but very charming the staff are always warm and welcoming and they never hesitate to accomodate special dietary needs the food is amazing and everyone treats you like family i highly recommend this to any foodie .
we had a group of 4 and all had the tasting menu we covered pretty much the entire menu the highlight of the meal for me was the appetizers from there i thought the meal got worse as it went on it was a pretty disappointing meal .
this place is great we ordered all the vegetarian things on the menu the zuchini pizza mango paneer eggplant bun and dumplings were all excellent the pau bhaji burger was ok overall the server was very attentive and helpful would 100 go back again .
most overrated restaurant in philadelphia this was not better than any middleeastern joint serving 5 gyros or fallafel the hummus was nothing special the meatballs were greasy total ripoff .
this is a tiny place with wonderfully inventive food the service was great and it truly is a great experience you should call to make a reservation and be prepared for communal dining .
had high expectations based upon reviews disappointed lamb was just fair rest of courses could have been staged more thoughtfully maybe just a bad saturday night for the kitchen .
small quaint interactive and spectacular and the food is amazing too .
food was not good at all ive had great middle eastern food before and this is not it .
very small restaurant w great service the paneer and scallops were good but nothing special the zucchini hummus pizza was absolutely amazinggg and i wasnt a fan of the duck but i dont typically eat duck so i wouldnt know id go back .
if u like small plates that are really expensive then go here .
fantastic best for a date or small groups this lovely candlelit spot is the size of a jewel box .
good ambiance okay service but the worse food in town .
one of my favorite restaurants this place screams new york and has solid food to back it up the owner and staff also kick ass you have to check it out .
fantastic food great location deafening music .
lovely restaurant and staff be warned its very cozy so you need to be willing to meet your neighbors try the zucchini pizza and the duck mushroom both really delicious .
the food was spotty the salads tried to be unique but were odd the hummus was great and so was the bread great atmosphere would not go again .
awesome restaurant not one bad thing on the menu must try everything especially the lychee martini only down side is that it is very small in the dining area but the food makes up for that .
extra small plates 3 bites literally for hostess is disinterested food is cold and nothing special drinks are bland and contain minimum alcohol interior designer did a pretty good job but the rest is meh .
great place for a bottle of wine with friends had a great bottle of red for 25 adorable decor and not to mention place mats great service .
the food was so wonderful and the presentation was elegant unfortunately i spent about 24 hours after my sumptuous meal at zahav vomiting up delicately spiced lamb and i didnt even drink or order anything that normally upsets my stomach boo .
this is definitely a new favorite of mine really kind service staff unique dishes which are described explained upon serving and a nice cozy ambiance such a great find .
my friend got food poisoning from eating their curry please stay away from curry dishes and please prevent this from happening again mr manager owner .
came to new york for a conference and ended up stumbling across this restaurant great food great ambiance for someone out of town it really made me feel like i was at home great job graffiti .
stop drop the phoking banh mi this place received a c grade from the health department barf unless you want rat poop seasoning in your pho skip this once delicious holeinthewall .
awesome food wonderful friendly service chef mehta himself was taking reservations the first time i popped in here he was so downtoearth and helpful and managed to squeeze us in though we didnt have reservations must try the lychee martini .
vietnamese take out had the shrimp summer rolls which were very tasty also had the banh mi sandwich which i did not care for at all i ordered it spicy and it was fiery i did not care for the grounded pork and could not finish the sandwich .
i am very impressed by the chef awesome place i dont have much to say right now but they are really original and tasteful very cool intelligent and classy place .
sent my food in a container with a big hole in it pretty disgusting mistake obvious sanitation problems are a huge red flag .
absolutely amazing food and brilliant service best meal in nyc so far impossible for it not to be a squeeze so go either weekdayweekend once you book in advance teeny tiny space is used to perfection food is combined almost scientifically for the palette great wine .
delivery took an hour an a half so plan on them taking a while aside from that the bahn mi sandwich was pretty impressive as were the vermicelli noodles .
pretty much all the reviews i read were spot on incredible food great service in a tiny space i really enjoyed the theme though the graffiti theme was very well put together definitely worth a visit probably not a first date spot .
good stuff staff talks about the customers in spanish calling whomever they thing is gay a marika means fag in spanish slang not very good for business maybe the owner great guy should rethink his staff .
got the hummus pizza pork buns and bottle of malbec all amazing everything they say about here is true you have to get lucky for seating .
service and food wasnt good i was expecting so much more from its reputation but meal just wasnt memorable with the price and service worth 1 star .
fantastic dinner even though we made last minute reservations and ended up eating at 10pm at a table with 5 strangers plates are small enough that you can sharetaste several different things but still have a filling dinner food was divine and service was incredibly warm .
meh black diamond burger and fries seemed pre cooked crowd was even more wannabes than usual and this was just lunch at the bar service was insincere and rushed not particularly attentive or pleasant either .
this was an experience we ordered nearly everything off the menu and loved everything except the pepper ice cream it tasted like a burger which is not what you want when expecting ice cream oh and lychee martini is amazing .
awful they brought our side dishes after we were finished with our main course and then they brought the soufflé after half an hour even though we ordered it before hand when we ordered the main courses no apology nothing not going back .
very unique fusion menu cozy cramped setting but they really make the best of the space the owner and one other waiter share all the tables so the service was great .
i dont feel the same way about this black label burger its not that good it has no flavor i really dont get it pasta zaza was the same ehhh its ok but not worth t he theyre charging .
excellent my memory is a little foggy but i remember sharing pork dumplings watermelon salad lychee martini chicken flat bread and paneer they lychee martini is so damn good stick to a party of 2 and learn to love your neighbor .
usually love this place but last time the maitred totally looked me up and down told me it would be an hour wait i cant help it if im pregnant and want to wear sneakers ok they clearly had two tops available .
very good .
a bit overrated im a huge foie gras fan but the black label burger lacked balance .
food was great tapas style the place is extremely small so you will share your small tables with others unless you have 8 people in your party the staff also explains the food very well it makes you appreciate the food more .
my first bad review not good i would have been just as happy at a burger joint i spent 125 00 for a burger steak and 2 beers i was expecting the burger to be better i would spend money elsewhere sorry .
this place is amazing my favorite dish was the hamburgers theyre the most flavorful burgers ive ever gotten we actually had almost everything in the menu and it was all excellent .
i know this is a meateaters paradise but the menu would benefit greatly from another vegetarian option in addition to the zaza pasta which has been on the menu for a veeeery long time id come here more often if there was more variety in the veggie options .
two words holy fck wow this restaurant is the definition of delish no room to move but hey thats part of the experience no have the zucchini pizza and the watermelon feta thingee yum .
for sure ive experienced better the food is good had the foie gras not so good expected more that is no toast with and the french dip it was pretty good but the service 1 star conclusion dont have reasons to return .
i have been here twice it is super small place and you have to share a table with somebody else but you can eat excellent indian inspired foods wine is excellent too service is great i like waiter and waitress explain your food each time they bring them .
service was great black label burger was not life changing .
the menu is very original and the place so unique it is a very tiny place so you have to reserve but definitively try this restaurant the service is really great .
by far the worst meal i have had at a restaurant in new york the meat was stiff and the marrow was disgusting absolutely horrible avoid this place by any means regardless of te positive reviews .
the cumin eggplant buns are to die for all i can say is this place is a must try difficult to get in without a reservation so book in advance .
incredibly overrated the highly touted 26 burger is no better than the 6 75 burger you can get at corner bistro a true disappointment i would not recommend minetta tavern .
chef mehta rules and props again to eateryexpert com for telling us to go here extremely small restaurant but yes this is proof that small things come in great packages im fully obsessed and will be telling everyone i know to go here thanks chef mehta .
i was so disappointed the food was not good tasted like frozen meals the place was not inspiring at all nor the service i wont go back they lost me at the first bite .
awesome food and service .
this place has changed i used to like everything including byob the price and the taste there is no more byob good food and good price used to recommend everyone but no way now .
genius on a small plate the flavors were unexpected and incredible jehangir was an excellent host whose descriptions of the plates helped tee up an amazing culinary experience catch him now before his stint on the next iron chef puts the line around the block at graffiti .
food is horrible cash or amex only is there another la sirene that everyone else just loves im so confused what i was doing there goat cheese tart ok filet mignon with foie gras meh strawberry tart what .
jehangir is an incredible chef and an incredible host the food was impeccable his explanations spot on and the attention to your dining experience unparalleled we spent 50 per person including tip exclusive of wine the wine was good and at reasonable restaurant price .
dont understand why this place has 4 5 stars maybe because its well priced and there arent many good restaurants in that area it doesnt deserve 4 5 stars though i thought the food was very mediocre no air ventilation with open kitchen .
great inventive food vaguely indian but more general asian fusion loved the pork buns hummus pizza and watermelon sorbet salad the dishes were all smaller than i would want though .
for the price one would at least expect great food an updated decor and keep the pretentiousness to a minimum right think again my recommendation bouley you wont regret it .
great for canoodling and yummy desserts plus a fun hole in the wall type spot .
practically in the holland byob is awesome mussels were great filet was shitty too much sauce the fiance said it tasted like a mcdonalds burger pattie good service .
i absolutely love this place the food is magnificent they have nice drinks friendly atmosphere affordable nice quiet friendly servers the food is seasoned so good .
i dont understand these reviews i had the goat cheese tart octopus and a salad the tart was nothing special the octopus was rubbery and smelled and the salad was ok this place is not deserving of the extraordinary reviews it receives big .
i really love their food and the atmosphere is really nice just needs a little more elbow room but its a very nice restaurant and again the food is delicious their prices are fair .
i went here based on all the great reviews i had the baked seafood and my wife had the pork dish the food and service was mediocre it was way overpriced for the quality i was wishing i was at jean claude in soho instead .
great place parking sucks though .
this place is okay dont go if you are very hungry or expecting a big meal you can spend your money elsewhere especially since it is not inexpensive .
gem neighborhood spot ive been here 3 times for lunch food is freshly prepared and well flavored with good sized portions the soups are amazing exceptionally clean definitely worth a visit .
i was expecting french bistro perfection and was underwhelmed the ambiance was nice but everything we ordered seemed flawed i wouldnt recommend the flavor just missed the mark .
been going here for years love the food fries need to be improved but other sides are an option take out is my usual experience few times i sat at restaurant area once i got a nasty waiter but thats ok food was still good .
food was warm the booths were extremely small and close together the food was overpriced and the eggs were burnt i will definitely not go back the hype about gluten free and organic breakfast is not worth the price tag or atmosphere .
love this place from the wonderful wait staff to the food and the atmosphere the best steak and paella ever .
boring blah and overpriced and gastric distress not what you want when you gotta have vegamatarian the only part of the visit that got 5 stars was our lovely waitress she was a dream .
first time to visit this place ordered seafood platter mango sangria we loved it great service too planning to go back here again bring more friends to enjoy it .
served me a salad and the lettuce had gone off genuinely awful they took it off the bill which is cool but i would recommend coming here to drink and only eat pub food my husbands burger was great .
always great food chicken is a must sangria is very good good service too .
nope expensive generic bar food depressing music while you drink really good beer almost counteracts the awesome beer selection last time they will see me .
love this place for their bbq chicken and rice ah their rice is amazing fav .
the cool moose was so much better good place if you want to meet farmington valley nannies and pinhead parochial types .
decent happy hour their wings here are pretty damn good the mussels looked awesome i will be getting them next nice little atmosphere .
the farmacy was really disappointing my friend and i ate brunch here while visiting philadelphia the potatoes with both of our meals were burnt i had a tofu scramble that tasted like air the restaurant ran out of bread would not go again or recommend this restaurant .
this venue is very big and i had seen a couple of shows here fun and exciting as a place like this goes and a good place for photographs .
only had drinks here the lychee mimosa was not very good a bit too sparkly and flavorless staff is nice and space is roomy .
i love this place the atmosphere is always appropriate service is good and selection is good not fantastic selection but good .
extremely disappointed with this place they served at my company and i ordered the grilled chicken dish which came with 1 base the amount of food i received for 8 was equivalent to maybe an appetizer i thought it was joke .
i really like this place but im trying to give away less 5 stars review to boost my cred on this yelp service so yeah i recommend the happy hour half price craft drafts and appetizers the fries are fantastic .
came in on a tuesday night completely empty got the beef cooked medium it was terrible not a lot of flavor .
5 happy hour mussels and theyre delicious sounds good to me .
i called in to pick up a large pizza i got there a few minutes early and waited when i got the pizza it was completely toasted and burned in some spots too bad the flavor was there but we could not enjoy it being so over baked .
great atmosphere good prices .
worst experience waiting for my pizza and they decided to mop the floors with ammonia and bleach everyone including the employees who were sitting and eating were turned off by the strong smell wonder what the health dept would say lost my appetite and left .
food delicious specials wings whatever you get its all good beer strong stable of good beer restrooms tiny one person easy to locate great neighborhood bar great happy hour great bartenders very chill but can get lively very quickly .
i ordered a chicken parmesan sandwich and it gave me food poisoning horrible place dont ever go to that place .
decent selection of beer and really great vegetarian food options i tried the black bean veggie burger which was one of the best i ever had my boyfriend got the brie sandwich which was really new and interesting its a cool place to hang out with friends .
im not sure what all the hubbub is about ralphs what am i missing whats so exceptional about it everything about it was absolutely average nj pizzeria pizza thin crust tomato sauce and a blend of cheese nothing else to say .
this is a great neighborhood bar that people come to from all over for the live music and atmosphere definitely a philly fairmount staple good beer food and mix of people i love this place .
everyone raves about his pizza but i have to go against the norm and say its overhyped unless you like thin crust terrible sauce and flakey pizza then this is your place i am surprised this place wins the local bogus best pizza contests go to scottos instead .
i am a big fan of this place i love the atmosphere and the bands the food is good and the drinks are better great crowd and the bartenders are awesome .
went because of the hype and that darn burger ranking food soso burger just okay most disturbing were the pricesthey didnt make sense with the decorfull lights up and seating on top of your neighbor the good news is that i dont have to go back .
great place to watch some live music in fairmount stage on one end bar on the other plenty of room to get around and the bartender was attentive i lived here for a year and only went once i was missing out .
if you truly want amazing authentic vietnamese sandwich go to ba xuyen in 8th ave brooklyn .
i really like this place good food love the yummy vegetarian options fun atmosphere great music nice servers great to have in the neighborhood .
this place was not the one for me halfway into my sirloin steak sandwich i realize the grayish meat has white hairs my appetite was gone instantly i especially wanted to like this place because i was in the mood for it .
north star is a pretty rough and tumble concertevent space and bar in our neighborhood they have a great beer list thats reasonably priced the bartenders are really friendly and its a lot of fun seeing a show here .
meh ive experienced better i know a place just a few blocks away that sells the bbq pork sandwich for 4 25 with a lot more filling and my mouth its burning they dont use bread they use glass shredders .
awesome beer selection for a venue and a neighborhood bar very hipster but thats all good the beer and chill atmosphere are well worth the trip there is no cover if you are just going to the bar on show night .
the stale bread was flaky the pickled diakon and cilantro was falling all over the place and the tasteless grilled chicken made the banh mi a disappointing mess i left the bakery a bit heartbroken but mostly confused after hearing rave reviews .
nice place to catch a show the happy hour is good 4 for 1 wings and half price drafts i miss the pool table but overall the staff is good and the crowd is chill good place to have a drink in fairmount .
convient location for a banh mi sandwich shop average tasting food in my opinion good not great i enjoy eating at raw and natural vietnamese restaurants not commercial tasting 2 stars meh .
i am a big fan of this place i love the atmosphere and the bands the food is good and the drinks are better great crowd and the bartenders are awesome .
i got a stomach ache from the chicken curry sandwich the roast pork bahn mi is good cheap eats .
i sat next to the grandmother of the drummer the drummer was great the grandmother was better she told me how she had courted in that very bar 35 years earlier its tough to be a legit bar and a concert venue nbar does it well .
used to like this sandwich but now my palate has evolved after checking out tons of other banh mi shops once was good under the bridge but now its just crumbles of meat some cheap dry bread and the roof of the mouth cut up .
probably the best venue to catch a band in philly they must have a great booking agent because a lot of the bands who play here end up getting huge within a year go weekly youre bound to witness the next big thing .
i think they are overrated the last time i had banh mi it was so dry that the bread almost slit my lips it looked like the bread was airdried overnight because of the kitchen smell but not toasted .
small friendly bar with a back room where you can catch some great live music .
got the 1 made me feel sick the place in the brooklyn china town is better ba xuyen .
very good indo chinese food remote location decent ambiance decent service i didnt like the options in lunch buffet .
its called saigon sandwiches in san francsico .
love this halal indochinese place their buffet isnt that great but their menu items are scrumptious i strongly reccomend to get their crispy honey chicken with noodles and their mongolian beef .
dont remember which sandwich i got but it was spicy the actual ingredients were pretty good and a decent price also a nice size half was a good portion for me but the bread was waaay too hard and crumby never ate the 2nd half .
get a bagel sandwich with egg ham cheese tomato and pesto mayo youll thank me also eating it on some random persons porch definitely adds to the experience .
the last two times weve gone here it was premade which made the bread tough and crunchy the ends of the bread were inedible and the pork was very hard and chewy im off this place now and going back to hancos in brooklyn made to order fresh .
henry st deli over kkds alllllll day everyday we all wish we had it in boston sriracha sauce king before it was cool .
sam bu luong drink is weird not my cup of tea seaweed longan chestnut maybe id try the banh next time but since there is lots of banh places in chinatown i will most likely try it else where .
cant go wrong with their sandwiches or breakfast sandwichesprepare for long lines on weekend mornings .
the flavor was good but the bread was hard and the meat was like pork jerky ive had way better in california the sandwich shop shares their space with a jewlery store so that was weird too its really small and always packed with people .
henry street deli is awesome fresh sandwiches good coffee great owners this is definitely the spot in burlington to get a quality sandwich they dont skimp on anything here they also have a nice selection of beer and grilling meats go here .
the food is not the fanciest but it is good home style polish food using quality ingredients and love my favorite was the dessert fresh baked poppyseed bread that reminded me of a local bakery in new britain my parents used to take me as a small child .
call ahead if you know what you want saves time .
the zombie punch was the worst drink i had in my life also 30 some dollars for two drinks .
friendly staff great selection fairly priced good scene no seating delicious fresh food two thumbs up .
walked in at 11 on a saturday there were 10 open tables but was told they wouldnt take walk ins because their computer was down absurd will not try to come again .
awesome sandwiches on fresh juniors bread great place for an affordable sandwich try a blt with sriracha cheddar and garlic mayo .
neighborhood brunch spot okgood food was not too impressed other spots are better like sidecar green eggs hawthornes and sabrinas .
best breakfast sandwiches ever best hungover breakfast in burlington .
went there for a business lunch with two clients was mortified when the 25 bottle of wine i ordered had a screw cap and not a cork this wasnt even the cheapest bottle on the wine list they should know better .
great .
the owner is so rude and i had kebab was disgusting cold and old i dont understand why do people go over there and sit out side for flaunt there are nice places in new haven .
tasty breakfast sandwiches and other sandwiches too at this burlington convenience store they stock highquality products and their staff is friendly and helpful .
really disappointed with this place chicken pita was so badly burned i couldnt finish it just really did not enjoy anything about it .
always good vaca frita thats what im talkin bout i got a mouth orgasm from dat dont forget to put the lime on it mmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm .
im not sure why everyone loves this place so much its fine but nothing special there are way better tasting mediterranean places in new haven mediterranea for example .
i enjoyed my first time at cuban petes the mini cuban sandwich appetizer melt in your mouth the beef empanadas were okay a little starchy the music was a little loud though and the dimmed lighting can make it hard for you to see and remember to byob .
falafel overcooked rocky hummus runny babaganoush different not with tomato which is the way ive always had itmade it this one is light brown paper plates meh looks like the place needs a good cleaning dinky tippy tables appreciate that they are open late .
best sangrias and food hands down really nice and loud atmosphere great spot for the summer they have outdoor seating .
the food is decent but the service borders on contemptuous its like the customers are secondary to some invisible preoccupation .
the food was great i had the ropa vieja and it tasted amazing the empanadas as an appetizer were even better the environment was great the only drawback was the place was crowded almost an hour wait to get seated .
uhhmmmmmmmmm no yes desperate times need desperate food such as 3 am and nothing else is serving food around even in those instances this place is a maybe but if you want real mediterranean food during regular hours just walk half a block up and go to kasbah .
one of my favorites restaurants so far all the food is amazing the service is amesome and the price is very nice totally recomended .
i like the hours service was not very good and good was so so dont think i would go twice .
great party atmosphere good food highlights are the tapas steak and pork dishes didnt like the snapper byob .
i like it in general but avoid anything with lamb here trust me on this one .
ive been here several times and as always this time was no exception i usually get the cuban but this time tried the fish tacos they were great as well next time i may try the pork tacos mix it up a little .
i dont like baklava sp this makes me weird so no comment on the dessert i dont get the hype about this place its not even that cheap usually get the vegetarian platter maybe i should branch out .
lovely place its byob bring your own bottle perfect place to dine outside in the summertime the churrasco is amazing .
i dont really get why mamouns is so hyped up it is open late and its cheap which is great but the food is mediocre and i always get a kind of sketchy feeling when im there also seriously guys you cant place a minimum on credit cards .
one of my favorite spots for dinner great sangria and the wings were excellent .
decent middleeastern fare but honestly it doesnt hold a candle to the nyc original or ibbys in jersey city nj for that matter if you want real mamouns hop on metronorth and go to the real mamouns in manhattan .
best cuban coffee ever fantastic place always packed no regrets no disappointments everything fresh and delicious if you have sombrero you can wear it here .
blech i live around the corner and i really like middle eastern food so i keep coming here hoping that it will be good this time alas my hopes are once again dashed by tasteless greasy falafel and kofta drowned in tahini .
long wait but the food was good i might go again .
the foods ok and the hours are just right but im not really into eating at a joint with terrifying bathrooms bug infestations and blatant sexual harassment of the waitresses sorry .
good meal good value just a little loud the music after awhile will give you a headache tapas appetizers are good and cheep the ricky ricardo ribs are pretty good you definitely have to try the experience .
cheap cashonly kinda place i do get stomachache after eating here now and again but hey when youre a brokea grad student how can you say no to a 5 dinner better bring cash though its the 21st century but believe it or not they dont take plastics .
amazing .
i have found mamouns to be a little dirty and the food is a little blah if i am in the mood for really good middleeastern food i will go to the olive tree in milford .
have only done tapas here must get ham croquettes those and the stuffed plantains lollipop chicken good ribs good cuban sandwich ace empanadas solid reasonably priced service attentive nice walkway to the restaurant .
very disappointed the quality has decreased tofu soup base is just plain water add kimchi we ordered 2 seafood tofu bean curd they only gave us 1 unfresh shrimp and 2 little calms thats all ridiculous plus a lot of msg .
food is good and the environment is very nice it was a little loud for me but nothing i couldnt deal with i took my dad and brother when they came to visit and they liked it as well .
i dont recommend this restaurant anymore the quality has really gone downhill ingredients are bad execution is horrible their oily and fried dishes taste overtly rancid fried dishes are either undercooked or burnt meat quality is questionable sad .
good food nice service super loud but definitely come here and try it for yourself .
this place closed and has now reopened as orlandos this is the family that operated this place in the 1970s as stewarts root beer i have not been there yet but will be soon .
other 5 star reviews are spot on not much to add went there only one time but loved it .
we went on a slow night and werent thrilled dont believe the hype .
great food and atmosphere i typically have the pollo cubano and sangria theres usually a long wait so try to arrive early .
overpriced kind of rundown and very americanized i much prefer chengdu1 and even chengdu23 which are not far from here even my then 11 year old son thought it was pretty bland .
excellent place very energetic wait time is not bad food wait is short very cool place .
wow is this place still in existance its in a real depressing area and i went there after reading good reviews on it it was nothing more then overpriced chinese food stick with chinatown baby for the real stuff .
the oxtail dish is delicious .
once or twice is fine but the food gets repetitive very fast i only tried a few of the burritos all were pretty heavy and didnt quite make me want to come again anymore .
the food here is always deelish i love the paella the fish is heavenly cuban petes does it for me im in love .
burritos are a bit pricey but not bad at all and you get some choices its fast food for the most part but gets the job done and perfect for a college town .
it was a great experience when we did visit this restaurant i did love the place alot of people the skirt steak was cooked to perfection plus the chorizo in red wine is my favorite the service was good too and attentive its worth to go here .
you can play a game with your orange chicken dish you can see that it looks orange but you will not find any actual chicken in the amalgamated congealed gulp crap my 6 95 is now residing at the bottom of the bin steer clear .
this is one of my favorite places to eat the waiters are sexy and friendly and the food is amazing its always packed but so worth the wait .
i have been here a couple of times i just dont get it service is blah the menu is just ok i always left shaking my head .
go here for lunch it is not nearly as loud the white sangria was excellent even without alcohol pork was excellent steak is ok as normal id stick with the appetizers .
very inconsistent .
had a great time there the food was very good the place looks great and the staff was very friendly would definitely go back again the only downside is that it can get pretty noisy .
great atmosphere service but mediocre food all the food was really heavy on butter and i love butter but not as the dominant flavor for everything expensive for the lack of quality maybe the bar menu would be better to try here .
excellent good food fun times i recommend the marinated chicken breast with black beans and coconut rice along with the plantains it is byob bring your own bottle for the sangria .
this placed has changed hands the chef is no longer with them this is being reinvented as an upscale italian rest beware it is not the same .
went here for my 21st birthday the food was so good the atmosphere was upbeat and they sang for me there sangria was really good just make sure you get there early if u want to avoid the wait .
i ordered wings and they were a bit salty the people there were friendly though im sure if i had called in to bring them back i would have gotten an exchange .
get here early the place is lively however their waiting method needs to be looked at your in a crowded area waiting for a table standing over other people eat .
pizza used to be good plain cheese pie was so chewy store had flies all over we just couldnt wait inside .
this place is incredible it is a favorite of myself and all of my friends if you have not tried it you must .
better pizza at dominos onion rings were as soggy as a cooked noodle p s the images on the web site bare no resemblance to the food no bubbly crust no golden cheese no light char on the pie just typical blah .
the cuban food here is amazing b y o b .
first time there since it reopened quickly remembered why it closed absent minded bar tending and long strand of hair on entree smdh good grief charlie browns good grief .
fun atmosphere good food great music a nice break from the usual american italian restaurants will definitely go back .
terrible service waited a long time for the waiter to take our order they ran out of the drink special the salad bar was old and the food was mediocre stay away .
i loveeeee it here ropa veja coconut shrimp are the best bring your own that can be mixed into a sangria or mojito street meter parking the owner is a doll and always accommodating fun lively saturday night out kind of place .
not a wine bar very limited wine selection flights not available loud music pass .
good food reasonable price good customer service great ambiance loud but fun expect to wait on weekends bring red wine or rum bring your friends or family parking behind the place or at fullerton for 5 .
food is great but service is horrible they get angry if you ask for anything i got a nasty look just for asking for a soda and a fork smh guess it was cause i look mexican .
i m here every sunday i love this place good food service is good too they get pretty busy on the weekends after 4 thou over all very nice the ambience is cool palm trees and cuban decor .
ive ordered take out from this place twice and i have not been impressed the sandwiches were bland and dry i was underwhelmed im not quite sure why this place has such amazing reviews .
go go back then go again one of the best cuban restaurants in the tristate area did i mention you should go because you should try the coconut rice instead of the plain white rice .
terrible service we were seated and completely ignored had to get our own water from the bar ended up walking out what the hell .
last month i had friends visiting from out of town so brought them straight here for lunch after picking them up from the airport as always food was on point delicious they loved it .
not what i expected dull tasting food with water downed drinks will probably give it one more try .
the food is so dam good my family and i keep coming bavk for more good to try and go for an early dinner cause the evening gets pretty packed but for good reason must try the flan its the best .
horrible place the food is good but our party was kicked out ten minutes after we paid i didnt even finish my sangria .
amazingly prepared food wonderful music albeit canned and very nice service staff not sure if they ever offer live music aside from brief interludes played by some of the waiters would be wonderful if there were live cuban bands sometimes .
my experience with this place fail .
amazing authentic cuban restaurant with the most delicious food ever ill definitely come back here the atmosphere all around is just awesome great for summer .
it used to be good the food is decent but the service went to hell arrogant low class thugs now serve you very disappointed long time customer mike t .
i love cuban petes alittle noisy and rushed but waitstaff is very friendly and efficient food is ific and drinks are well done ample offstreet parking in back .
this place appeared to have great reviews but was really soso i wasnt greeted for about 5 minutes while standing there food was good but really just average drinks were better than the food unique combinations .
byob great place everything is excellent always packed arroz con leche is on point .
i really tried liking this place but the food was overpriced they were unable to give me what i ordered from their menu for each course dessert drinks dinner and apps my waitress was great but i dont think ill return .
me and my family went here to eat lunch after church this place was amazing foods were delish and absolutely fairly affordable but it was loud prolly because the next family seating beside us swallowed 10 megaphones the fudge manners please .
came here a few months back kinda small food was okay and our waitress could care less will not be coming back .
this place is an easy 5 stars great atmosphere great staff usually always busy but its worth the wait i come all the way from ny to eat here amazing amazing amazing .
it was ok the only thing they might have to adjust is the seating cramped decent food amount and price will try it again .
i love this restaurant very delicious and well seasoned food main problem is that the sauce was way too oily the last time i went chicken lollipops are delicious and fast service nice pleasant atmosphere .
good authentic mojitos average ethnic latin food wont make a trip to be back .
5 stars i love this restaurant the food is always great and the atmosphere is always festive outdoor seating feels like you are dining in cuba with the palm trees and the music .
festive atmosphere nice staff seems the bar is the focus though not the food which is what i came for cachapa and empanada too small no chkn inside the oily chicken empanada wont return .
byo and pretty loud but all around great place wasnt too impressed with entrees tapas are definitely the way to go goat cheese fritters and beef empanadas are great .
ive been here several times and each visit its just okay i think the best part is the atmosphere it just has that fun bright and colorful flair again cant say anything great about food flavor is just okay cooked okay .
600 plus reviews need i say anymore had the chicken stew it was awesome came with beans and plantain the stuffed peppers were good as an appetizer loved the mojito a must have just get a glass instead if a pitcher if you are going alone .
super pricey and way too packed this restaurant should think of expanding alot of people come to the restaurant and they simply can not handle the rush rather spend my money at a place that doesnt want to rush me out and can handle the dinner rush .
restaurant is really good the service and staff are very friendly food quality was amazing and wait for the food was short ropa vieja taste amazing highly recommended .
not worth it for the price staff is friendly but you still have to wait an hour to get your food and portions are small for the rich and famous not for the 99 eat elsewhere .
what a great place the food is delicious prices are great and its byob you cant beat that i loved the atmosphere crowded but inviting ill definitely be back here again .
the food only lacked one thing taste service was slow air conditioner was off and it was 90 degrees outside chairs uncomfy .
great place with great atmosphere and food inside though it can get loud it is byob .
this place has great ambiance and a real latin flair this will draw you in too bad the food sucks balls dont come here ever .
atmosphere is fun service was great and the food was delicious best skirt steak ive ever had .
went here once not sure if id go back as it was a scene and way too loud food not out of this world i should know as i spent five years living in south america and i know my arepas .
delicious as usual i have the skirt steak like i always do and it seems to taste better n better every time its byob and they provide the sangria mix one of my favorite dinning spots .
we didnt like it at all food sucked as did service wished we went elsewhere .
everytime i am in montclair nj i always come here love the food it doesnt matter what i get its always good they have music playing and great atmosphere great for groups .
they charge u extra to toast a bagel whats next an admission charge to enter the premises i live around the corner theyll never get another nickel out of me .
food is delicious and great for the price byob is recommended stay away from the weekends place is ridiculously packed i went on a wednesday and it was nice pleasant and no wait i had the grilled chicken black beans maduros abd white rice perfect .
the place is getting a face lift its being modernized all of the charm of this once quaint historic enjoyable and magical place is gone its a disgusting transformation of one of my former favorite spots in philadelphia rip venture inn .
awesome awesome food one downfall the crowd that goes is the definition of well ratchet as you could call it .
good diner food chicken with gravy mashed potatoes nice steamed veggies for 15 chicken livermore not as good as i remember it its good solid comfort food .
during the summer you can sit outside and the tapas are great again get their early during the summer they are super busy .
nice cozy spot in the neighborhood the two star review is for being told that they were too busy to take an order that i was willing to go in and pick up when they supposedly offer order for pick up .
love cuban petes been here many times for private parties girls night out and dates love the food love the music and staff sangria is great love that its byob everything about cuban petes is amazing .
not sure how they can such a nice rating food is below average at best .
i liked the ropa veija chicken cuz liked enchilado with shrimp no alcohol but a liquor store three doors down on to ratdog at the wellmont fred you nearby he he .
went there when they first opened up and it was horrible not sure if it has gotten better based on the reviews below but will never go back there go to masala grill which is always good .
americanized cuban food much better than i expected considering the comical name of of some of the items like the ricky ricardo ribs i tried some of every ones plate and everything was really good as a cuban i can recommend this place .
awful food i love indian food but this was just disapointing all together the chicken tikka masala tasted liked a marinara sauce even the rice was bad will never go back nor recommend it also very expensive save your money and take it elsewhere .
authentic food fun vibe and great service can get loud and busy but its part of the experience and worth it .
blah mediocrity nothing is very tasty or fresh the service is friendly though the decor is drab and depressing it is pretty reasonably priced .
awesome place there is not a bad thing on the menu place is always packed yet the service never lacks the mojito mix that they make goes perfect with bacardi limon if youre in the area definitely stop in here .
i ordered the salsiccia pizza i really wanted to love it but the crust was soggy and i ate it in the restaurant maybe its just me but i like a pizza crust that can handle its toppings .
great cuban food that is only overshadowed by an even better atmosphere .
had the magherita pizza was underwhelmed overpriced for portion size waiter was inattentive dont understand the hype of this place will not be back .
absolutely remarkable if you dont eat here you are a moron .
dont order delivery here called an hour after placing my order through seamless they hadnt even started making the food yet dont recommend .
great place to have a really good time the manager is really nice food is great its byob the staff is really nice as well .
i am a regular at this place for years always got the falafel sandwich and they do have good falafels hence i crave for it but charging a dollar per falafel is absurd i was shocked to pay almost 7 dollars for 6 small falafels .
byob cant go wrong .
greasy hummus eggplant soaked in grease couscous sautéed in grease grease chicken drippings .
date night and decided to order a bunch of tapas and a side of rice the perfect amount of food for us and all very flavorful definitely worth coming back .
meh food is ok hummus is ok they arent very nice there and most people waiting on you have really bad english so they hard to understand i wont be back .
while the food is good i would not describe it as the star amazing service and vibrant fun atmosphere if you are looking for an upbeat fun dining experience step right in byob they have amazing cubans fruit juice combinations to make your own tasty libations .
two stars only for the food hummus and falafel are both horrible no flavor at all id rather go to taim and maoz pita bread is bland too i make better hummus than these guys .
service muah food fabulous tappas on point and if you love fish try the fried whole red snapper and introduce yourself to the owner hes the guy with the big smile mustache am .
gyro is disgusting and gave me a stomach ache the hummus sill sucks second time around i hear the laffa is great but i wouldnt give this place a third chance the pita is just bland and made with pretty low grade flour and other ingredients .
great environment and food the owner was so nice and help byob place which is a plus anything on this menu it awesome the mixed drink are crazy good i would say stop by on a busy night it more entertaining and fun night .
id expected this place to be a lot better i was totally wrong went to this place with a few friends one saturday afternoon hummus is watered down its supposed to be creamy not like soup falafel was mediocre i dont recommend this place at all .
have been here four times and have had great food and service i highly recommend this hot spot .
nothing special sort of like a mediterraneanstyle chipotle chicken was sort of dry whole wheat pita was a bit dry as well its an okplace if you have no other choices but i think there are some better options around .
if youre looking for inexpensive dinner spot this is not the place it is a bit pricey but the cost is reasonable given how delicious the food definitely worth the price .
steroidpumped owner was unbelievably rude and ignorant choosing to antagonize instead of satisfy this customer besides that i experienced the staff as in a hurry with incompetent communication skills will not ever return owner needs to learn some customer relations skills and manage his misogynist tendencies .
solid food that always hits the spot been a few times now and service has always been spot on as well the menu is huge always a chance to try something new the coconut rice and sweet potato sides are always excellent .
the drinks are pretty good but it gets pretty crowded and hard to order a drink there are better places to get mixology cocktails in the city i would skip this one and go somewhere else .
always a positive experience at cuban petes service is top notch and services is spot on sometimes can be loud but the food and the atmosphere are great yes byob our first visit we were drinking sangria and we thought we were drunk it has no alcohol .
looks great but hears awful its all hard surfaces tin ceiling and tile floor so on a saturday night your ears will be ringing .
wonderful great food the servers are very nice sangria is nice the atmosphere is great cant beat it .
weird crowd and strange drinks very dark and cold atmosphere .
the food is amazing a little cramped and loud but the menu makes up for it .
the service was superb and the food was good that said they were out of bananas chicken and french onion soupin other words pretty much half the menu bonus they only take amex .
seriously great indoor and outdoor seating its packed for a reason nom nom nom tapas and sangria .
really not good i just got home from dinner and feel gross from the meal service was good wine was good food was terrible not worth the money at all .
love this place great food great service and a friendly owner .
my order took over an hour to get delivered then they didnt even get it right i shouldve known when i had to repeat what i wanted twice to the girl on top of that the food was cold and terrible i ripped up the menu .
great food great sangria good times always go at an of hour the place is small and tables are very close together the music gets very loud you cant hear the person sitting next to you byob .
uh no everything there is brown and sad .
food is great amazing sevice lots of good energy and a great atmosphere recommend to anyone visiting montclair .
dont go mexican they slap cheddar cheese unevenly on top of everything and big globs of sour cream presentation was unappealing salsa was good fresh house salad was totally wilted tres leches dessert was dry opposite to what a tres leches is supposed to be .
the food atmosphere everything was perfect and it byob so thats makes even more perfect the food was amazing will go back very soon lol .
worst service ever i cant comment on the good because my lunch break is over and i have to leave without getting my food the iced tea was ok thats all i was able to get from my original order .
the food there is to die for and the price is to love love the ambiance this place is my fav place to go out to dinner with friends and family .
so very pricey yes all natural no flair at claires its good til youve had better for less anyway great locale and they are pleasant .
food is very good ambiance is fun and after adding your favorite libration to a base of house mojito the very loud sounds become so much more tolerable .
i ordered the granola and the milk was nearing room temperature the granola itself was good but the room temperature milk ruined it .
what a find great food and a wonderful atmosphere i cant wait to go back it was like stepping off the street into a small cuban town .
i can make better vegan food at home for cheaper bottom line .
its like walking into havana except smaller and probably cleaner and a little further north ok its probably nothing like havana but the food is good and they deal with kids well so theres that .
dry pastries bland food overpriced everything come on now lets get away from bland cheesy greasy food really this prissy little place is an anachronism .
i just love this place .
this place is not very good they would do better to focus on taste rather than selection how could they possible do 50 things well all in the same day .
best cuban food i ever had so yummy i also love the atmosphere its very sexy chic the owner dominick is a big sweetheart he always comes around to make sure we are enjoying ourselves your crazy not to try this place .
tried this place for the first time this past saturday the egglplant parm was alright but the buffalo soy chicken pizza we ordered had a long black hair intertwined in the cheese nasty .
never disappoints the fried red snapper cerviche steak everything is good here service is great and its byob .
this place is terrible we ordered four dishes and could not finish any something called buffalo chicken blabla was too greasy i do not even bother to argue with them and get refund i just regret going into this place .
food is very good service can be a bit slow at times very loud dont go on a weekend night unless you want to wait a loooong time .
30 minutes to get 4 overpriced sandwiches made to go ugh .
the food was great and the atmosphere fun my husband loves the pulled pork sandwich i love their sangria great place for a quick easy dinner out .
we werent impressed with claires certainly not the worst ive ever had but boring blah and relatively expensive id skip it .
great food .
poor customer service .
i had never had cuban food before and honestly didnt know what i was expecting here well im hooked .
im confused as to why anyone actually likes this place the food is terrible bland and overpriced its not veganfriendly barely vegetarianfriendly and most certainly not customerfriendly you could find a better meal almost anywhere else in new haven .
the food is generally good but theres some excellent items on the menu the cuban sandwich is great as is the ox tail paella was chock full of seafood its crowded but if the line is too long just go somewhere else youre in montclair after all .
chocolate coconut cake tastes like a brick .
great food decent price the waiters are not very attentive and the outdoor seating is not where you want to be when its hot out great vibe though you forget your in mountclair .
worst customer service of any restaurant staffed by total jerks ive never once been there when they havent screwed up my order in one way or another and every time theyve been completely unapologetic mediocre food and lots of attitude thats claires .
my favorite restaurant now had a little bit of everything sweet plaintains steak paella byob makes it even better great location and even better music come here and try a little bit of everything the churrasco is mi favorito plato ven conmigo .
yuck you may as well stay home and make a frozen dinner i never reach for the salt shaker in a restaurant except when im at claires give it a shot if you like bland mushy food .
test .
ive been into this place several times but aside from the pastries ive never been able to find much that appeals to me all the cakes and pastries are really good though also everything is really expensive and not impressive enough to live up to the price .
my favorite food was the popsicle chicken and red snapper .
ive been here a couple times and both times i was really disappointed bland bland bland maybe i am ordering the wrong things i have friends that love it .
awesome place to go with friends and family just go before 400 so you do not have to wait great atmosphere and great food w .
this restaurant is a monument to a mid1970s conception of vegetarian food but without any flava whatsoever the desserts are usually a good value because the slices are enormous but theyre not any better than something you could bake at home using the moosewood cookbook .
love love love the food papa rellena appetizers are a must along with the churrasco skirt steak .
theres no reason to like this place and no one does yet its always busy why probably because of clair who doesnt maintain the same mystique as patricia ive never had anything tasty here their breakfast specials always sound good but never seem to be available .
busy place very loud awesome food best place for cuban food hands down .
if you like to be lectured like a 5 year old then this is hipster heaven for you overpriced and pretentious in a puerto rican and dominican neighborhood seems out of place i wish they would focus on improving their food and customer relations .
ambiance is awesome with lively colors and beach theme great food great sangria and always a fun night just make sure you make a reservation .
i was walking by and decided to give knife a try i got the chicken sandwich and it doesnt make the cut for me .
do not go here if you want a nice quiet meal this place is loud with that said the food is delicious especially anything with steak the decor and the service staff uniforms complete with fedoras are great and really give the place a flavor all its own .
vietnamese sandwich was pretty decent balance was off but it was satisfying and price tasted like decent quality ingredients service was a little inhospitable recommend but only in a pinch .
food was excellent we had to wait like 30 minutes on a week night to be seated but once we were it was really great service nice atmosphere tapas were really good i would definitely go back for another round .
fair food fair service not impressed .
awesome food great service and atmosphere the owner goes out of his way to make you feel welcomed top 5 spot in bergen .
it was my second time and it wasnt any better with the new menu the tables are minuscule the service is on the slower side and the quality of food is just average .
great food and good service every person i have taken there loves the place .
ridiculously slow service with mediocre food .
good atmosphere tasty sangria white and red bountiful plates of tantalizing meaty treats good experience .
they need to take kitchen out of the name of this place the music and vibe were good but we ordered dinner at 815 and were served at 1020 who cares what the food tasted like at that point ridiculous and insulting .
great personable service amazing true cuban food loud music but not for everyone love it or hate it skirt steak and coconut rice was amazing .
disappointed we got deliver goat saag and lamb curry way too spicy and two pieces of meat never again .
great food the one problem the music is way too loud .
i was not impressed with the pizza the crust was really thin the bottom of the pizza was full of flour and the pepperoni smelt spoiled i would not recommend this place to anyone unless you are short on flour the critic .
great atmosphere amazing food the appetizers are amazing chorizo is phenomenal and they give so much byob is a good thing usually crowded but tons of fun .
very snobbish dont be surprised if they dont want your business .
i have been so many times are love every time the food if pretty good .
theyve managed to make a chicken pot pie so small that its basically an appetizer for 16 00 seriously why great for the many young bland loud boring and oblivious types gentrifying this city into a mall .
best cuban ive had in the ny metro area .
small portions pushy service mushroom pot pie ok macaroni and cheese ok .
good food and a great atmosphere servers were really friendly overall a really good experience .
not terrible but not great the samosa was dry lamb shank curry was nice but mean on the portion size slow also overall 510 .
great atmosphere food was very good .
the more i thought about it the more pissed off i got about this place yea it wasnt good at all yall are not special get your service up and up properly lamb wasnt even that great tasted like tomato sauce with gaminess at the end .
this is one of those places that guarantees atmosphere bring your own rum and order the watermelon mojito some people forget that its cuban food expect your food to be fried its good stuff .
the restaurant staff is courteous the food is less than average simply an overhyped place certainly not worthy of the stars or the hype look around in the immediate vicinity you will find much better restaurants avoid this .
awesome food lively and vibrant atmosphere excellent sat night dinner spot .
these guys screwed me they never even delivered my food after i waited for three hours dont order from this place .
best cuban food in the area if you complain about the wait thats your fault for not checking before hand if you can write a review online you can check their website and call as well no liquor license but bring a bottle of wine for sangria .
this is sad i saw sign of food violation sticker on door it was close .
amazing i have never walked away unhappy the atmosphere is perfect and different excellent for a summer night there is usually a long wait but its always worth it the portions are huge you definitely get a lot for your money .
the worst indian food i ever had terrible staff and attitude .
flounder was outstanding suckling pig flavorful but a bit dry on lean parts yams and yuca prepared to perfection coconut rice and rice and beans were awesome service mediocre the place is always busy a bit understaffed but that doesnt keep me away .
no reason for this food to be any higher than 2 stars least flavorful indian restaurant i have ever been to .
best cuban food in new jersey great atmosphere a little loud people are great dominic the owner is great always there remember everyone keep coming back for good cuban food .
not a whole lot of flavor in the food portions extremely small as well quick service but generally underwhelmed .
i always look forward to eating here the food is amazing and the seating is nice too has a great cuban vibe to it and you feel like you are in country one of my favorite locations to eat in north jersey .
the service was great but the food not so much .
came here with a friend for lunch as was not disappointed the place can get pretty loud but the food is good we tried skirt steak and chicken then there was dessert yum .
wheres the chicken good flavor of the chicken savoy and big bread was just ok a let down .
food was amazing service was awesome sangria was fantastic definitely plan on coming again .
not the best pizza crust tastes like the pizza has been sitting around for a while the tomato sauce has an odd flavor not what i remember from their pizza from nutleybellevillebloomfield area .
lechon y yuca frita the waiters are very nice and i love the music playing its loud but great salsa music .
tried a shrimp parm and their plain pizza the sandwich was edible at best no reason to ever order it again the pizza was mediocre i dont understand what the 5 star reviews are all about the place was busy but i wouldnt go back .
great food great atmosphere great service id say the one negative is the byob which to some may be a positive the drinks are pricey considering you are providing the alcohol .
the food is mediocre at its best the service is terrible they seem to be all new to service industry needs a overall of food and sevice .
food is delicious i love the outfits the waiters wear adds to the whole cuban vibe .
friendly staff food was very very average i was concerned that the female blonde bartender sat on the bar twice and swung her feed over pretty sure the health dept wouldnt want her feed on a food surface honestly expected better .
food is awesome service is great very noisy and gets very busy after 5pm and weeks very crowd luv the fact in the summer you eat outside n enjoy the weather with a great meal totally worth going been here numerous times .
went when it was not busy i didnt expect to be doted on but they were extraordinarily slow the food was lukewarm at best and they really did not care not at all worth it .
the wait was a bit long but the food was well worth the wait the plantains are to die for .
way over priced for quality of food just alright not worth the money shrimp cocktail was fishy and soft the swordfish was pretty good as well as the mac n cheese .
good food good service there have been times where the service was a little too slow but it has only happened on few occasions i love the chimichurri skirt steak .
came before a show got a burger a decent burger but an expensive burger that is all i have to say .
pretty grooood cuban food and gotta love the byob to have them make fresh sangria andor mojitos .
too crowded overpriced and shady with the homeless prefer italian market .
i like this place the food has always been good every time ive gone portions are excellent and they are not really expensive can definitely get crowded on the weekends but i luv it still .
though plentiful in variety this place has ratsmice ive seen them scurry by while i ate here .
love love love this place i recommend the enchilado with yellow rice i wish they took reservations as the wait is a little long on the weekends however it is well worth the wait .
i think this place is overrated there are a ton of places to get food but i think the seating situation is terrible outside of a few places i have really been let down on the food ive gotten here .
visited this place twice in a week everything i had was dellish and the wait was sooo worth it definitely try the flan and drink up all the sangria possible so many options its hard to choose where to start .
though ive heard a lot about this place and this one is the closest to my office i would still say they are not worth the money not good options for veggies and the place is too crowded .
i was a cuban petes supporter since the very beginning and i will continue to be until the day they decide to close wonderful cuban cuisine as diverse as its patronage flavorful keep up the good work .
the indian food that we had there was pathetic stay away from the indian food stall .
great food great atmosphere very reasonable prices gotta get the mojito pitcher only down sides are that its really crowded and loud at times to the point that its hard to hold a convo wait times can also get long on certain days .
i know a lot of people love the reading terminal market but when i went i thought it was to crowded and crazy .
omg what a great place you have to try the ricky rocardos ribs beef ribs fall off the bones braised in apricot and served with ricebeans and yuca amazing .
i guess worth checking out just to have checked it out but this place is like a freaking zoo complete with overpriced junk food .
the chuletas were pretty great empanadas were small but good flavor regardless i tried my friends ropa vieja and i intend on eating that next time byob is cool too portions are large so you are more than likely to take home some grub .
the market is an experience small stands offer unique foods if you like baked goods try amish bread and sticky buns the best we have ever had unfortunately the crowds can be a little overwhelming .
food here is pretty good but the best thing here is the setting this is a great place to go and sit down eat and talk .
seems so fun but actually blows lots of unique vendors who sell the same food you can get anywhere else in the city with only 10 times the wait there are amish there though or mennonites or whatever the hell if that gets you off .
charming atmosphere with good food at reasonable prices and friendly efficient service i only wish i knew it was byo beforehand the food just goes better with beer or wine .
wasnt impressed attended bridal shower lunch food was mediocre at best but service was horrible wait staff clueless .
amazing food .
marras now called il piccola is not what it used to be fish meat are frozen not fresh sauces are average if you like soso food in a tiny loud environment this place is for you .
byobb andor mix with a pitcher of drinks available from restaurant good service friendly atmosphere and good food at reasonable cost couldnt ask for too much more .
horrible pizza although their other dishes are always pretty good .
fantastic cuban restaurant great decor and outdoor seating areas everything on the menu is amazing the steak is seasoned well and delicious the portions are big meaning left overs for lunch friendly staff and good music .
pizzas are good pastas and stuff not so good some people call this place mama grossas .
great food authentic cuban food byob and bring some bacardi to spike your mojitos lol .
i always hear amazing reviews of this place so i decided to try this great brick oven pizza sadly this pizza was and continues to be pure crap never again .
fantastic food generous servings the restaurant space is great spacious indoors and quaint outdoor courtyard .
if you work in fidi trips to fraunces tavern are because of the nuremberg defense only coming here because your boss and everyone else does the actual food drink and decor of the place is subpar .
every time we go here we get tapas you can never go wrong with that we love the chicken lollipops and many other of the tapas the sangria list is very good as well but be sure to remember to bring your own wine .
why i went here for a business lunch and was completely underwhelmed maybe it was what i ordered a rueben sandwich perhaps if i had the chicken pot pie i wouldve rated higher theres nothing about this restaurant that makes me want to go back sorry george washington .
consistent been there a dozen times and every time its what you hope good place for families who want quality food fan of the suckling pig but ive had a number of entrees and all have delivered hard to finish your plate w the portion sizes .
i guess it was not bad then again i guess it wasnt that good there was a museum meh .
my friends and i came here on a tuesday night and we were seated right away we ordered a pitcher of sangria .
we went for burgers and beer it was ok i wanted to like it more definitely cool for the history and architecture but there was no ambiance in the dining room no music it was kinda depressing .
third visit to cuban petes chorzio was excellent and plentiful i had the grilled skirt steak with cilantro garlic it was excellent also had mango mojitos they were excellent .
touristy particularly on the weekends go to soak up the history of the place which is worth a visit and not for the food or service which definitely are not the food is average and the service particularly at the bar is absolutely horrible .
one of the best restaurants ive ever been to amazing cuban food and amazing environment in general definitely recommended .
the draft are not impressive although extensive the location is packed and very loud fries are good but stay away from the wings the worst bbq chicken wings ever soggy and covered in sweetened ketchup .
damn good cuban spot in the summer u can eat outside the place gets packed thou food portions are good also i really like this place .
it was neat eating in the oldest building in the city but the food was rather average my wife actually didnt even finish her dish .
good salad good byob spot .
very disappointed in the service food and price i has the smallest beet salad ever made and the saltiest braised mushrooms i love the history ugh .
oh man churassaco yum best dish on the menu if you dont mind the obnoxious hosts long waits and overcrowding then this is your place great cuban food .
the restaurant offers standard fare for vegetarians and nonvegetarians alike there is nothing wrong with the food per ss its just not particularly creative also service was brusque and robotic .
great food great service it just sucks that its so good because it gets really crowded on the weekend and you cant make reservations for less than 6 people suckling pig goat cheese balls and vaca frita are our favorites byob .
food is great service and space great but all ruined by worst soundtrack ever soulcrushing early 80s mistakes blaring get your food to go .
i really like the food and love the atmosphere great staff as well .
not really a mediterranean place im looking for usual favorites from the mediterranean but no luck .
come hungry and leave satified ive been several times and ive never been dissapoointed .
shopping saturday before xmas 420 pm and they wont seat us because the kitchen is closed .
everything ive ever eaten here is delicious even my father who is the pickiest eater i know loves it here ive had the chicharon de pollo carlittos way chicken suckling pig paella its all amazing the ambiance is great too .
overrated can i rename it siggys not so good nice atmosphere and service but the food was average at best .
great place we brought friends and our babies early on a saturday night and they were very accommodating loved the food and atmosphere it feels like youre on vacation our only regret is not discovering this place sooner .
nasty help serving average bagels .
one of my favorite spots great lunch specials good environment good food .
review not based on food need to update online menu prices waste of time going there this morning to see all prices are 12 more than what is on their website thought i finally found a breakfast spot with reasonable prices the search continues .
the place has an awesome feel and cool decorations they have over 12 kinds of spiked punch with fruit etc see my picture on the place the portions are huge we had picodillo con tostones and empenadas as our appetizers best cuban food i ever had .
slow service dirty table overpriced and tasteless food coffee wasnt even refilled and there were 5 people on staff definitely wont be back .
i have eaten here many times the tapas are amazing i highly recommend the goat cheese fritters .
this place is the closest restaurant to my familys house eaten here plenty of times since it came about its gross plain and simple nasty i had it for the last time tonight i wish it were still friendlys from way back in 1993 trust gross .
this is a fantastic resturant i would recommend going when the weather is nicer as it has seating outside as well as an open feel the food is delicious and the atmosphere is very enjoyable .
meh i had kopdolbibimbap for lunch the egg was fried hard and tough the hot stone bowl was just warm to the touch and the contents were lukewarm very disappointing .
loved this place i went with my friends on a weekend and it was so packed we couldnt get in through the doors we waited over and half hour to be seated the wait was worth it would go back again .
i dont get it the pizza was tough and dry .
if you like a thick sandwich this place is for you i go here every few weeks and get the roast beef hands down the best deli sandwiches in the area the price isnt bad either considering they definitely dont skimp .
cheap drinks and lots of parking other than that meh dingy and dirty and the bartenders are some of the worst ive ever seen the crowd has a lot of weirdos also cops love to sit near the exits so beware .
little more pricey than your supermarket but its good to support local small businesses .
great service great bartenders awlful food could have stayed home and cook it better myself just have a irish dinner here drinks and booze .
this is the best italiano ristorante in the state the pork chops siciliano are unique and yummie the bar is spacious the apps are increadible and it is a reasonable price the veal is the best in the city .
rude crowd sticky floor dirty bathroom where you can see easily into the mens room and very clearly to the urinals and high priced drinks way too loud for my liking and it was pretty slow that night ive never met a bar i didnt like till now .
olive bites and the italian nachos can not be missed the chicken cutlet could be the best ever so get the chicken milanese and lastly get the coconut cream pie i know many coconut haters that love this dessert .
when boyz ii men end of the road is playing when you walk into a bar do yourself a favor walk out .
nice local bar just stopped by for a drink and the bar is nice and everyone is very friendly will be back to try the food because it smelled really good .
i dont know the new mix fajita is a way to rise the price food was really good though the food server was not friendly and he was little rude over all i didnt feel comfort yesterday maybe i will try different branch next time .
i was hear at least 2 years ago i dont remember the pricing but i do know i had a great pasta dish .
used to go there a lot was a little disappointing every time though the quality of the ingredients is good the food is just not always that happening also dont run out of bread maybe it feels more special that way but really its a dick move .
excellent homemade italian food service was attentive we will definitely be back .
food delivered half hour late all of it was cold and asked for ranch 4 times didnt get any never again .
we had our dinearound meeting here the other day good food good people good host thanks pj north jersey regional chamber of commerce jim feeney .
dont get their burgers i got the diabolo burger and got a burnt patty on a bun i expected a little more never again the delivery guy was scum too .
strip mall exterior very pleasant interior food fresh imaginative menu and consistent a very good thing fabulous well trained wait staff bottom line an excellent local italian restaurant .
pizza is good but waited an hour and a half for one pie to be delivered it was cold by the time we got our food horrible service rude phone manners youll get it when you get it .
good 1 star for the owner pj meeting and greeting us warmy on entry more later .
n .
ive never actually eaten here so i cant comment on the service but the take out is always great fresh and tasty which says a lot bc take out sushi isnt my favorite yumm trex roll is soo good and im a sushi snob .
over rated the lunch special have a small soup it s like boil the water then throw the stuff in ramen noodle taste better then that .
ordered through yelp very convenient it was under 30 minute delivery time and inexpensive food was decent i got generic rolls nothing was bad i just maybe should have splurged and tried a fancy roll to make it a fantastic experience will order again bec of convenience .
got the yellow curry and it was very diluted and weak tasting barely any flavor at all couldnt finish it ive been here two or three other times and its never really impressed me .
ive been going here often now lately im definitely addicted the lunch special is unbeatable 3 rolls soup salad for under 15 dollars i recommend going between thursun cause thats when the food is the freshest go here .
we had the panang curry and pad thai noodles service is non existent and the curry was diluted i find the thai basil cafe in weha much much better i wont be coming back here .
went on new years eve and had sushi for half price all rolls very good and it a byos bring your own shaki try it out .
some of the worst food we ever had i am not kidding stay away is alll i can say veal milanese was grey oily and tasteless shrimp scampi all cornstarch with tasteless frozen shrimp it was our first time there last nite and irt was also our last .
i was here for a launch party with friends the joint was full of life and authenticity though i didnt get to try the coffee there were good wines good vibes and tasty antipasti a muchneeded hangout for the neighborhood and the sweetheart owners seal the deal .
must be new owners not a smile in the place its like theyre doing you a favor to take your money foods good but i only get pizza .
really cool stylish european esque cafe nice location right near the central park conservatory limited selection of food but the paninis were very fresh and tasty pretty cool place .
if you love salt and soggy pizza you will love dabuscos i dont recommend this pizzeria ive eaten at dabuscos at least 4 times and every time this place disappoints .
a lovely little italian coffee shop tucked away on the ues some good coffee and really good espresso drinks the baked goods are pretty decent too check out the back area its pretty a nice place to come and just hang out .
great pizza terrible customer service on our last trip the restrooms were filthy and had no soap .
authentic italian style cappuccino panini alcohol served as well hidden seating in back wwifi a hidden gem .
the pizza was oily and had no flavor i would visit rite aid next and make my own .
love this place and the cute italian guys who run it their sandwiches are delicious and they even have wine now .
made the trip out to eat some native comfort food but they were closed for the summer so save yourself a trip and visit them in the fall oddly their website did not forewarn wouldbe customers about the summer closing ah the balkan ways .
iced americano was great barista was really nice nice interior to sit reading the paper or catch up with friends its a neighborhood gem .
i would have given a higher score because i like their chinese dishes i was disappointed with their japanese dish the ingredients wasnt as fresh as i expected .
best cappuccino in the ues this espresso bar is not only adorable but delivers great coffees and pastries try one of their croissants with your cappuccino you will not be disappointed .
horrible they lie about delivery every time you have to hound them or wait 2 hrs for your food .
great sandwiches and the best iced espresso the salami sandwich is the best italian panini ive had in ny tasty and filling friendly people too highly recommended .
i love this place but i want to write a negative review in hopes that they will post it on instagram drop dead you jerks you suck .
one of the few coffee places in upper east serving genuine italian espresso and the derivatives excellent quality coffee in chilled atmosphere with friendly italian baristas additional pluses are the shady courtyard and the spacious clean bathroom with the nyt on the rack .
not happy with the brunch we ordered too much food and too little taste just a hig mess that you can get at any diner in astoria skip this .
great addition to the neighborhood the area is seriously lacking good coffee so the appearance of da capo was very welcome cute little spot friendly service fab coffee looking forward to trying the food perfect for people who work at or are visiting mount sinai .
food was ok but my girlfriend can make a better omelette and not charge me thirteen bucks for it worst part was the gross realization that one must pay for coffee refills especially when the coffee aint so great probably not going back for some time .
espresso drink and bitesized biscotti like a boss italian style amazingness it would be a crime to visit starbucks down the block when this fantastic small business has better quality for comparable prices .
greasy sloppy and disgusting in addition to the poor quality of food theres way too many people working there and they cant seem to stop staring at you or rushing you to order the restaurant is in astoria though all the employees seem to think theyre in williamsburg .
5 stars for the amazing cappuccino i had this morning one of few great places in this area to get a decent coffee lovely decor and great atmosphere in this light filled cafe restroom is a plus i will most definitely be back .
drove 15min to get here arrived at 450pm stood around in empty restaurant for 5min no server or anyone just a mop lame then a guy pops out and we ask about seating he informs us nonchalantly that there is no service jerks .
been going here for years there steaks are good and i love there dessert i always get there shrimp as an appetizer i think its one of the best around .
you would think that comfort would include refills on coffee on a early sunday afternoon when i really needed one .
i always order the taco platter and flan and im always satisfied and full the place is simple no frill no thrill but the staff are pleasant and i enjoy the music as i wait for my meal to be ready .
eh me no likey the chicken n waffles were not enticing nor appetizing no bueno .
i really appreciated the owners attempts to reach out to us after a less than stellar visit i think our experience was the exception and not the norm we look forward to returning and trying the burritos everyone raves about .
do not eat at this restaurant my entire family had food poisoning the food is spoiled the workers in the back are extremely dirty the restaurant is dirty its amazing the restaurant is still open despite several health code violations the owner is horrible .
everyone here is so nice the burritos are inexpensive and a million times better than chipotle the burritos are slightly smaller than chipotle but quality over quantity the chicken burritos are fantastic .
very average food takes a long time for your order to come out of the kitchen portions are pretty small for the price they charge very dull interiors the veg biryani was different every time we ordered .
pros food is awesome great prices nice people cons small place not many tables inconvenient for large groups conclusion this place is great me and my home boys eat here often get the mariachi plate its awesome .
its ok i guess for a local joint it will do to me the food seems dry and portions are small for the price paterson is the best place to get great kebab .
authentic mexican do check out the fajita salad its awesome big portions great homemade taste .
the food is decent but they need a face lift when you eat in you feel like youre in a 70s log cabin everything looks old and dusty .
the service is super friendly and attentive the food is amazing get their breakfast burritos chorizo extra spicy they never disappoint .
the service was friendly but the place is so worn down inside and the food was just ok i asked if the hollandaise was homemade or from a mix the waitress said i dont know i think homemade the answer is it is not homemade .
always a big fan of their football sized burritos salsa is awesome and a great appetizer while you wait for your food look past the appearance and discover some solid mexican fare .
while the food is good for diner food on 2 different occasions i had an issue with hair also next time you go in look at the wrapped cookies n stuff right by the register covered with strands of hair .
super friendly crew very robust salsas and sides their mariachi platter was a knock out .
guys i realy hate to say it but the food has realy gone down hill i hate to say it becuase te people are so so nice but its the truth and now we go to the verona diner instead sorry .
excellent local mexican place friendly great vegetarian options .
get ready for a fried experience ds favorite homemade potato chips beer battered fish chips for fried foods are good otherwise its a four page menu of fried food .
best mexican food in the area very tasty and solid portions homemade salsa verde is awesome one negative is the foam containers even if youre eating in .
went here once very slow and the food was bland and just not good had the fried calamari tasted like rubber the chicken ceaser was good but its kind of hard to mess up a salad .
delicious food quick service with very friendly staff reasonable prices large portions and complimentary chips and salsa with every order large selection of diet soda which is unusual but appreciated .
this restaurant is no longer here it is now fitzgeralds go to fitzgeralds for a great burger or meatloaf .
the food was really good just super fresh and flavorful everyone is right about those desserts the tres leches is awesome and the staff was was really friendly well definitely be back again soon .
some food was oversalted other dishes were bland big disappointment i ordered poached egg and leeks and it showed up with three slimy chewy leeks on a plate with a single egg the service was great food was meh .
food meh tres leches cake omg i stop by to pick up a cople of pieces for dessert now and then when going to a party i receive requests to bring their tree leches cake make on site by a sweet older mexican woman very nice people .
service was great but the paella was very soggy the sausage was really hard and the taste wasnt the same .
better than cullen fresh salmon and roasted veg made a perfect 10 lunch i will be back .
ordered the vegan stew good flavor but stupidly small portion for a 20 bowl of veggies .
visited a buddy of mine in the jerz this past weekend and we went here for some pizza and sandwiches place was awesome food and good prices ive been to a few places with him in past visits never really impressed david alans was legit thanks .
the food is alright though overpriced considering it is so forgettable .
the grilled steaks are delicious and plentiful it is a good place if you are a steak lover and know which cuts to order the items in the salad bar are also very fresh i thoroughly enjoyed my visit here and hope to be back again .
service and food were horrible other places in town that deserve my business the bar area and food there was god awful .
what a way to end the year hell of a meal this is the place for meat lovers i recommend the rodizio great value and a cool atmosphere .
pretty ordinary food but the prices are quite expensive .
you cant go wrong with anything you order we will eat here at least once a month the sangria was amazing red or white you cant go wrong portion size is very generous and the service is always good .
the first time i came to this restaurant i really liked it but the last time we came here on 729 the food was pretty bland the service was good and the atmosphere is great so i will try it again not impressed this time though .
i like this place because of the bangin rodizio and the fact that they have a full menu besides that great seafood also the guys here are real madrid fans put yer phone down and get over here .
what a waste of money theres a lineup for no apparent reason sat at the bar to skip the line the short bartender is terrible signal to the tall bartender if service is desired youll be disappointed by the food that is all .
this place is absolutely amazing no matter what you order you cannot go wrong simply amazing .
overpriced for the ordinary food atmosphere cozy but pretty noisy .
great place we order every week from our dealership bruno is very attentive to our orders and the food is amazing the best steak place in northern nj .

hefty prices for overly meaty dishes .

it has the best outdoor seating area in all of princeton but the menu is extremely limited and the food is overpriced its better for happy hour as they have great drinks and awesome marinated olives but have not been happy the last couple times weve been here .
exploring rodizios in newark this is by far the best one good variety of meats and restaurant setting is highly recommended for a special date the place is well decorated with its originality of antique appliances the quest is over for finding the best rodizio in newark .
the food was perfectly fine but whatever it was is not authentic thai or even the moderately americanized thai food you can usually rely on the service was good and the food tasted fine just didnt do anything to cure my craving for thai .

bones in my chicken cheese steak waste of money and food both non edible sandwiches its a shame service is horrible here as well save your money ive got a feeling this place wont be open much longer unless they shape up .
amazing if youre a meat lover the pineapple served at the end is incredible the all you can eat meat bbq is fairly priced .
this place has cheesesteak in their name so you think theyd good but they were pretty awful bread was too soft the steak didnt really taste like anything and i could barely taste any cheese .
unassuming place just go in and be surprised food monster lobster double wipe goodness sluuurrrppp if youve never had octopus have it here staff will definitely spoil you this is happy food in a happy place .
food was just ok not a place that ill frequent .
by far this is my favorite portuguese restaurant the rodizio is fresh and well seasoned with a large selection of beef the staff is polite and attentive go to this restaurant if you want to impress someone .
a lot has changed things used to be much better before pasta came out over cooked and dry soup was lacking flavor ive been coming here for years and it seems like they changed the whole staff overnight not a happy camper .
numero uno take everyone i can here if they can get past the fact its in newark rodizio is a must sangria is dynomite and the ambiance is just short of spectacular been here countless times and never have a bad meal a .
closed bruno tried to sell the place but it didnt happen rip to my favorite fried chicken place .
have been here multiple times never had a bad meal price is fair for what you are getting always a to go bag a lot of food for the money parking is tight if they are busy .
nice atmosphere but 16 bucks for a bowl of udon with over cooked pork belly really sushi is at room temp which i personally hate one star for decor nvr again pros lots of other choices around cons prices which not up to par with quality or cusine .
excellent dinner come here hungry as you will get tons of food recommend the filet on the tile paella valenciana and of course the ridizio the deserts and alcohol coffee especially the fernandez and spanish coffee are really good overall never walk out there hungry .
this place is adequate nothing particularly interesting for food or drink the waitresses were nice .
i took my son and his mother to fernandes steak house for his 19th birthday the food was very good and the the customer service was excellent can wait to go back .

came here for a coworkers party and we all enjoyed our food the portion was huge the food was really tasty will go back .

went on easter sunday and i was not disappointed the portions are huge and the atmosphere was nice seating could have been better but all in all a good experience .
awful service mated with below average food quality equals a complete miss this is even bad by airport standards .
salad bar can use a wider variety the pink sangria was very good service is exceptional plus free valet parking rodizio was great waiters should provide more info in regards to plates on menu which can be confusing if you dont speak portuguese .
more false advertising i need chinese delivered its just after 9 on a saturday night this is the 2nd place that wont deliver 5 minutes away from them .
this place is the bomb rodizio is not salty like others waiters are very attentive and polite valet parking is a great plus .
chicken with garlic was was kind of spicy pork fried rice was dry and chicken lo mein was okay .
this place is the best you havent eaten until you try this place .
very bad service and attitude 甚至欺负本国的留学生。老板素质很低，食物多为冷藏加热，早茶很不新鲜。if you want a happy meal with your friends or family it isnt a good place the owner of the restaurant is so mean and rude .
this place was incredible the rodizio was overwhelming in all the right ways service on our group of 15 was nearly impeccable though drink service was a little slow because of orders moving between the service staff to the bar all good though .
pretty pricey compared with chinese restaurants in similar quality many dishes on the menu actually unavailable the food was ok however i suffered a terrible stomach ache the next morning that i had to skip my childs school opening ceremony will not come back for sure .
really nice atmosphere great service my paella was done very nicely and the rare steak came out rare and tasty ill definitely be coming back the sangria was absolutely amazing the bread is served warm and is better than what you usually find at restaurants .
mediocre spicy szechuan fish was decent the honey walnut prawns were bland and poorly executed overall inexpensive and clean restrooms for a chinese restaurant maybe good for takeout or togo orders seems popular with local college students .
good rodizoro .
overpriced small portions service was good i would not recommend this place once was enough .
parking valet is a plus had chicken with garlic sauce it was sooo good their portions are large so it can be shared although the bbq sausage i was not fond off a little on the hard side salad buffet comes with entree .
nasty disgrace that this is amax family just want to walk out and not pay .
i went there with my former coworkers around 2010 and let me tell you the food is out of this world the rodizio there is secondbest the ambience is great and the price is fair recommended .
terrible food avoid their sushi items like the plague .
awesome awesome awesome awesome awesome awesome i cant say it any better awesome thanks for a great dinner i love steak and this place is deffinately now one of my favorite keep up the good work guys .
went here for taste of hartford menu nothing stood out lobster and pasta tasted like it had been reheated in a microwave disappointing overall .
if you are looking for a place to eat real and delicious brazilian barbecue this is the place the ambience is pretty welcoming and the staff is nice .
food was okay but these people need some service 101 courses ate at the bar nobody smiled said hello or checked to see how my food was when they delivered the check not even a thank you didnt even bother to look up incredible get it together folks .
everything was good and service was also good .
had some takeout and was really underwhelmed the festival bread was stale plantains tasted just as old after a five minute walk outside and the jerk seitan was boring .
having eaten at every brazilian place in newark my girlfriend is from brazil this is by far the best food is great as well as the staff the seafood and rodizio are top notch dont eat for a day if you are getting the rodizio .
dont do it stay away nothing but disappointment awaits the secret is just take whatever they bring you whether you really ordered it or not so when they ask seabreeze but you really ordered a tequila sunrise just take it trust me .
pros delicious rodiizo friendly service reasonable price cons there was a weird smell in the restaurant not a rich wine selection .
stay away worst place to eat anywhere on plante earth no one to ask whats going on no manager on site 1 hour to get coffee overall awfully experience .
went to fernandes for our annual pilgrimage this week and it was fabulous yummy grilled octopus followed by meats meats and more spectacular meats friendly attentive service and great wine recommendation warm wonderful vibe there is no reason not to go here .
worst service and experience ever at an airport there was so much confusion by the staff and the require ipad orders just made it worse i would never go again .
excellent service and drinks enjoyed our entrees very much better then any nyc steakhouse out there .
i should add that the diners at guantanamo bay probably got better service .
normally i wouldnt drive to newark unless going or dropping my familyfriends at to the airport but for fernandes steak house yes i would drive to newark no matter what besides food the service the atmosphere and the decoration are very nice .
pizza is cold and very poor service mgmt was poor is responding for fresh pizza .
this place is just awesome for meat lovers great service ambiance and the food is to die for we will definately be coming back for more .
horrible i was here and experienced a pizza shortage there was like a bus of kids .
a solid place for rodizio .
not real pizza very crappy quality and i was very disappointed with how dirty the restroom was i will never return .
there are so many reviews for this place that no matter what i write im not going to add anything new to the discussion its just a fine good steak place and the rodizio is the best .
we decided to try it out since they have 5 dollar deal the pizza was bad and so was everything else i hardly ate anything i wouldnt recommend this place .
hands down best rodizio in the area staff is very attentive highly recommend this place you will not be disappointed .
awful just melt cheese and top tomatoes on cardboard for a better pizza .
second trip here another great meal 1st time we had the rodizio this time we ordered off the menu great service good food will definitely be back .
for 10 dollars we filled our bellies but i dont know with what the pasta had burnt flecks in it and the restaurant is dirty .
great food and service .
for under 10 bucks it may be a deal but not a good meal newly opened cicis is messy not managed well and the staff seem disorganized pizza is fair salad is ok the bread sticks were the big winner .
i have been to other rodizios in the area this is by far the best the place is classy and nice my server treated me very well i would recommend it .
you get what you pay for complete shit the only reason this place gets 1 star is because i cant give it worse your better off eating at a truck stop restroom .
great restaurant for meat lovers i would recommend the sangria the menu is extensive good for large groups as well service is good i would go back .
the owner has the worst attitude that i have ever seen rude would be saying nicely the food is ok at best but not worth having to deal with this character .
this place is amazing get the rodizio go hungry avoid the bread and fill up on some of the most amazing meat ever flank steak blew my mind but everything was good valet only .
just found the regular plain pizza to be sub par at best the pie was oily beyond compare and the taste was bland overall no char to the crust at all will not be back .
so far my favorite place in the ironbound section .
the military was banned from eating here soo i sure as heck dont trust this place .
good food reasonable prices great atmosphere highly recommended .
a rude water ladytable cleaner and try picking up the garbage outside once in a while dont waste your money terrible .
good food and great service we went with an extremely large group and had the entire upstairs to ourselves the arangments were made ahead of time but everything was spot on .
its a diner not an especially good one at that dont get me wrong its not dirty or bad food its just a diner .
best rodizio in ironbiund .
the wait staff doesnt speak english so i was not surprised that my order was wrong order exactly as it is written on the menu or your order will be wrong the pho was just ok .
great great food service cant be beat and friendly if i had to say anything negative it would be the wait time even with a reservation but the food and staff is so great i can overlook it .
absolutely the most disgusting experience ever in a vietnamese restaurant perhaps chicken served with copious still greasy skin as grilled all dark meat and tendons stay away 5 or 6 really good vietnamese choices just 5 blocks west on washington .
a definate go to place for me and friends very friendly accomodating service and plentiful good food the best rodizio in newark .
ive been here several times and the food quality has been different each time the restaurant has an overall grimy appearance and its a crap shoot on how good your pho and spring rolls will be the staff however is generally attentive and friendly .
love the food sangria and music family atmosphere .
this place is not the real deal play it smart and stick to washington when i told them i didnt like something they told me too bad pay for it .
been here many times for delicious rodizio but this time we ordered the filet mignon cooked on tile served cooking tableside and it was delicious along with the garlic shrimp great food and service packed on a tuesday night cant wait to return .
amazing concept extremely poorly executed the mac and cheese was terrible dry with a strange taste the chicken was overcooked under seasoned and not worth eating my advice dont waste your time or money on this fake out of a great idea .
vegans please skip to the next review everyone else 4 5 stars wow yeah its as good as all the yelp reviews just order the rodizio and sangria worth the trip into newark valet parking youre welcome .
cold and simply nasty chicken 35 dollars down the drain mac and cheese was burnt overall not worth it make your own chicken im sure its better .
good steak like the inside .
i really really wanted to like this place but didnt the chicken wasnt great and not such a wide menu to select from the staff was extremely friendly and helpful and the place is cool but the food was bad .
great place to eat a while lot of food for a great price .
good sandwiches in soho but its hit and miss i got a middle eastern type sandwich that was totally bland even though advertised as spicy and the last time i went i ordered the mediterranean tuna but got turkey meh .
by far the best period .
nice guys but i think the cream cheese on the bagel i got is past its expiration date they dont really have any breakfast sandwiches so probably not the best for an early morning bite .
meat galore omg the all you can eat rodizio was amazing the white sangria was wonderful will be back with my family soon .
nothing special i tried spice mushroom sandwich and mozzarella sandwich spilt soup side salad subway sandwiches are even better for me ha ha my favorite sandwich is olives take out place in prince st thats the best .
ive been to brazil a couple of times have several brazilian friends and have had amazing meals at the best churrascarrias nyc has to offer this place holds its own in the category we will be back .
bad service and bad food they gave cold soup i order a milk shake they gave chocolate milk we had about 20 in our group meals came all over the place all i order was a blt i gave up waiting for it drive right by this place .
lots of people but worth waiting excellent grill i love rodizio .
used to be a great diner hasnt been in many years they need to get with the program on what good food tastes like made the grave mistake of ordering lasagna there it was totally gross and indelible .

decent waitress service barely edible food dreadful management .
closed destroyed by fire was one of the best portuguese restaurants in newark hope the rebuild fast other recommendations solar do minho in belleville and roselle park nj .
used to be a great diner .
this has become our regular place for dinner on guys nite out we were former brasilias regulars but fernandes is far superior rodizio and 24 pitcher sangrias make for a great evening .
ive eaten here a few time with friends but never again after last time food was horrible service was poor thats being nice .
awesome awesome awesome rodizio at its absolute finest .
one time i ordered a cheesesteak they forgot to add the cheese .
this portuguese restaurant has the best codfish ive ever had great wine selection as well highly recommended .
i tried gamburger soon after it opened and wasnt exactly blown away i havent been back since and dont plan to make it a habit it was a burger it was fine it wasnt expensive but it also wasnt really anything meh sums it up best .

terrible meat quality does not look sanitaryclean inside stay away .
loved the ambiance and service there food was good as well chef is good at pairing ingredients with different sorts of sauces beautiful platings and nice selections for prixfixe .
coffee and food were good the barista was really weird i dont think i will be going back .
oyster leaf amazing service and wine .
the food was very lack luster no flavor and served lukewarm the mimosa flavors are tasty pomegranate orange passion fruit peach but are not worth the slow service and mediocre meal better brunches are out there .
we came for dinner and we were early no problem we got seated the staff was beyond polite they were genuinely concerned about us we had a great meal creative delicious and beautiful truly an exceptional experience .
food was okay but the restaurant is the size of a shoebox and is terrible for a large group coupled with the fact that the maitre d was one of the rudest people i have ever met will definitely not return .
i had one of the best meals here some time ago would definitely recommend everything was amazing the 5 course meal with rabbit veal and other courses was great i dont think i had a course here that i didnt like i will be coming back here soon .
enjoyed the beet salad and crostini but the grilled pork chop was not good and the mash potatoes were bland .
amazing everything is cooked to perfection simply an art definitely will be back all 8 of us .
the food was bland i got a grilled chicken wrap that was supposed to come with balsamic vinegar but it didnt the worst part was that it was soggy they were not very friendly either that was my first and last time coming to this place .
best restaurant in nyc juni is amazing the food is excellent as well as the service definetely going again .
ill give it 1 star because its pizza but horrible at its best fake tasting cheese crust either old or frozen took an hour 20 minutes for delivery poor service poor food wont be getting pizza from here any time soon .
the best dining experience i have ever had from the canapés to the dessert each course blew my mind i was never left disappointed not one negative thing to say the service was fantastic and professional unlike any i had ever experienced a memorable experience .
lychee martinis are deadly they should be illegal come here only to throw a few back and leave .
we had the chefs tasting menu food was exceptional and service was flawless decor was intimate and warm a good place for a long pleasant meal and quiet conversation .
ok not to be a downer here but i do not get why this place has good reviews place has busted tile and ripped leather seats happy hour is not that happy plus the drinks are icky .
we were there 2 nights ago and the food was amazing the service was perfect will definitely go back when visiting again .
the service was sooooo slow the drinks were good and their happy hour deals are good it took us at least 10 minutes to get our drinks and then we got charged for a drink we never got .
exceptional meal and exquisite presentation attentive and friendly service definitely a repeat .
the asian waitress doesnt ever come around to check on the tables shes horrible when we needed the bill i had to chase her down after watching her flirt with someone for 30 mins never again btw the food and drinks were terrible .
amazing tastes and presentation with fine wine parings in a sophisticate calm room for adults dessert impress .
strong and cheap martinis but the establishment is just so dirty no thank you .
review is for the prefixe lunch menu well nothing much to say excellent food original and perfectly executed great service and a bargain for lunch .
this place was okay on a saturday night around 1 it was totally dead i liked the atmosphere but it seemed like a restaurant bartenders were annoyed drinks were strong though .
a true dining experience with very creative interpretations with amazing ingredients very classic small food big plate experience fun for trying new things a little quiet and stuffy if looking for more social dining .
hm it was crowded when i went and the crowd seemed a little cheesy it couldve been a bad night i guess people flock to verlaine because of the crazy cheap happy hour prices id rather pay more and not be squished .
we had a wonderful server who was very attentive however after eating here we had to drink lots of water on the salty side and on the oily side .
i love when people spill drinks on me rub against me and throw lychees at me only one of these is true .
i love their biscuits and ceaser salad at this location but i feel like the wait time at the south plainfield location is usually shorter i love their strawberry piña coladas the seafood trio with shrimp scampi and shrimp alfredo and their lobster bakes .
very bland and unhealthy food got a severe bacterial infection after eating buffet please check all the hidden reviews before making a decision to dine here they all convey my experience with this place at your own risk not going back ever again .
i like the service and the place i love their lobster pizza soooo good i like everything i ate and drink in there .
very bad experience my husband wanted to cheer my bad mood we were passing this restaurant and decided to eat here it screwed my mood further awful food extremely bad service first time we wasted food will never recommend it to one .
very good cheese biscuits longer wait times though didnt anticipate to find good veggie food at a sea food restaurant .
went to buffet on sunday food was tasteless and even not properly cooked service and staff was ok so 1 star for that .
great neighborhood bar they have a great selection of ever changing craft beer their sunday quizzo is very fun and great for groups i had the roasted artichoke and the coffeecola wings both were absolutely delicious and i will definitely be back for more quizzo and food .
food was barely acceptable however that wouldnt have been a problem if it was fresh the worst part was when we told the manager that it didnt seem fresh instead of apologizing she got incredibly defensive and rude would not recommend to anyone .
this was a good place i would rate them five stars but they gave me spicy food when i asked for everything to be non spicy still this place was pretty genuine and special .
food was ok but nothing special waiter was polite but it was the same guy that was vacuuming the floor after serving the food because of that it was noisy also he was just wearing jeans looked a hit sloppy .
fabulous beer selection and yummy bar food vegetarian options yay .
this place is gross the workers carry meat with their bare hands and the place smells rancid i went there to pick up some chicken for my mom and waited close to 20 minutes when i got home the meat was spoiled .
fried brussel sprouts so delicious they haunt me in my dreams great beer selection cheers to doin it well .
okay this mcloones feels totally disconnected from any of the rest its pretty creepy and filled with old gambling men it also smells like dirty atlantic city being 28 this isnt my scene .
local 44 is my go to spot to grab a beer andor some food their beer selection is awesome and they usually have good on the engine selections they are always happy to see you and make your visit pleasant .
the food is definitely not worth the price very low quality when i asked to speak with the manager a woman named joan came over she was far from friendly poorly run restaurant dont waste your money .
good service relaxed atmosphere good beer selection the eggplant gratin was not so great though i would go back and try something else though .
if you want to pay for their recent renovation this is your place i will say however that they have great screens for the local sports enthusiast the beer and food is extremely overpriced for the value in spite of the pricing their burger is tasty .
had the 44 burger it was really tasty extra dollar for pickle and bacon little expensive a must try for anyone in philadelphia .
nothing impressive subpar food and typical center city prices for draft beer good enough for tourist crowd but not for regulars tap house in univ city is much better .
little bit pricey but worth it they have really impressive and diversified high quality beer selection and the folks behind the counter know whats up this is my new local beer spot for both bottles to go and nursing the draft .
wow i was thinking about ordering from this place but after reading all these scathing reviews i think ill save myself some grief and go with burrito bar cant go wrong there i love yelp .
love that hits place is just a few blocks from my office its got great beer a wonderful staff and amazing food a fantastic place in west philly 44th street corridor .
this is terrible mexican food dont waste your time or money they start with low quality chicken beans etc the end result is food you cant eat and if you do youll regret it as soon as youre done .
local 44 has a great ambience to it i was surprised by the menu it seemed like the type of place that would have generic bar food but the menu was full of inventive and daring combinations definitely a good neighborhood spot with a solid beer selection .
service good and location great but food very mediocre .
this place has tons of excellent vegetarian options everything i have ordered here has been superb .
food was overly salted and a little stale great location wine selection and people watching .
my favourite bar in west philly i find myself here most nights im in the city of brotherly love top notch beer selection interesting menu with several vegan and vegetarian options available the beer selection far outshines the menu though in both quality diversity .
outrageous prices tiny portions the waitstaff tries but theyre overwhelmed by the wealthy tourists once was enough .
brilliant smoked beer and they had some room for us on a saturday night we had a brilliant time .
food is not that great pizzas were good pasta fagioli was terrible .
good gastropub with a nice diverse menu try the appetizers .
bad service no kids menu 30 dollars for pizza i didnt like the food and the price we paid added to frustration would no recommend this place especially if you coming with kids .
vegan weekend brunch with their own vegan poptarts made fresh in the kitchen boom and yeah great beer doesnt hurt either .
food is not bad but wouldnt make an effort to go ideal if meeting someone near time square for diner you dont have reservations .
i havent eaten here yet ive just been here for drinks and the selection is amazing .
food was good but overpriced after our meal the waiter came around with a tray of dessert so we got a chocolate mousse cake and it turned out to be 12 .
great beer selection though food menu is a bit limited bar is small but cozy have come here a few times for quizzo and had a blast .
garbage ass cannolis and the biggest waste of calories tasted like mascarpone inside a crispy waffle cone served over some blueberry and almond purée sauce where the hell do these people come from trying to serve us that for 12 and call it a cannoli never again trattoria .
specifically came for the seitan reuben after a recommendation from a friend it did not disappoint loved everything about it flavor size fries were great too nice atmosphere friendly bartender spoke to the owner for a few ill definitely be back .
made reservation on yelp came in and were seated promptly in a corner then seem to have been forgotton as two other tables that came in later ordered first order for water had to be requested 3 times before delivered food was expensive but nothing special disappointed .
great place love the satan rueben sandwich friendly staff great beer all around good place to grab a drink and have a delicious meal .
the goulash here is terrible very watery i was shocked the sauce was water and salt terrible the beef was old crumbly chuck cubes whoever cooks such a goulash hates life .
brunch is great they serve beermosas as in mimosas but with beer instead of champagne they honestly get 4 stars just for that ive been here otherwise for dinner drinks great beer list its often crowded but we didnt have a problem getting a seat for brunch .
the food is extremely salty and disgusting nothing to brave about it the place is a ghetto thanks god i didnt get sick .
ive been here a bunch with friends for late night brew noms great bar food exceptional beer list a west philly fav .
racist standing waiting for a table polish guys come i after me and they were seated before me speechless .
one of the cooler beer bars ive been to in the city had a pretty sweet microbrew beer selection would give them a 5 but their appetizer menu is kinda small nice atmosphere .
the food was tastey but far too greasy maybe it was an off night four of us ate four different things and we all got sick wouldnt go back again .
great beer excellent salads and cool atmosphere a little pricey but overall im definitely a fan .
rice and green beans were over cooked steak was good but you could do better elsewhere .
big selection of craft brews on draft for 4 50 jukebox not too bright that is all .
love the location for ducking out quickly to see a show across the street and the service was ok there were definitely no issues with the food but ive had better overall an aok experience as nothing particularly stood out .
burgers are delicious ask for a side of their horseradish sauce for dipping the porkbelly tacos are also pretty unbelieveable awesome beer selection friendly staff .
the food was not impressive the interior decor is kind of cheesy although i did like the waterfallwalls i tried the homemade gnocchi and it was nothing special the best part of the meal was the homemade pesto dip for the bread .
one word baby burger mmm .
called for takeout one night 1 hour later we called to find out where our food was and were told that we would get it soon 1 5 hours later i was fuming needless to say we cancelled the order and wont be calling them again for delivery .
great neighborhood bar awesome beer selection with knowledgeable and attentive bartenters you gotta try the bacon cheeseburger it was amazing .
no so good when the eggroll is the best part of the meal you know you have been to bad chinese restaurant i will not be back and they have a 20 00 minimum for debitcredit .
great beer food is ok super university city crowd .
horrific service food bad decision going there took 25 mins to just get a drink .
bar food is delicious i cant believe how solid the menu was plus they have a fun selection of beer good vibes from the bartender and lots of space for groups seems like the perfect combo for a neighborhood bar i will be back often .
awful do not get the filet mignon .
delicious fresh food charming atmosphere just a wonderful dining experience i recommend stuffed highly .
nothing on their menu is appetizing the food is cooked with no seasoning and is just bland there are better steak houses out there go somewhere else .
great burgers without being heavy or greasy you can taste the quality thick and tasty minestrone soup .
dont waste your time or money unless you want bland food with really poor service this is a msu hangout and that is what you can expect .
tried it tonight for the first time takeout did the montclair blue burger and fries pretty damn good next time ill ask for the burger a bit more rare a nice addition for montclair food scene .
pretty much everything everyone has written in all of the reviews before mine is correct both weird and comforting at the same time .
there may be a place called burger king but stuffed is the king of burgers the bacon jam burger was absolutely delicious i will be back for another this is now my home for a burger .
the food was good place homey wasnt impressed with the speed of serving food and getting bills been there more than once and the best to be said about their service pleasantry and speed is one word inconsistency .
bacon jam burger is amazing great management looking forward to a return visit soon .
this place might be great for brunch but our dinner was awful salmon was fishy and tasteless the spinach tasted like dirt definitely would not return .
this by far is the tastiest burger in nj eating here is a very pleasant experience bring your bottle of wine and its a feast best fries anywhere had it twice already im back tonight for grass fed all natural on a bun made by famous ny bakery .
coffee bland oatmeal bland french toast yummy uninspired overall but it may be that we ordered badly the egg dishes and pancakes looked great .
omg bacon jam fries they are by far the most delicious thing ive ever eaten i think owner was little standoffish but i couldnt care any less as long as i get to eat those bacon jam fries at every turn .
food was overpriced and underseasoned service was quite atrocious though .
best french fries ive ever had please support this place and go there often so i will always be able to eat these fries thank you my bf says the burgers are amazing .
very disappointed with this resturant the food was blah i order the cream spinach egg thing and it had no flavor lets just say they can do better .
great burgers and selection including create your own the fact that i have been there four times says a lot staff is very friendly and i plan on being a regular .
slow as hell service decent food forgetful waiters cash only and they tell you that at the end .
hands down the best burgers ever the montclair blue burger is my favorite and the bacon jam fries are out of this world fair warning they are completely addictive you will come back for more .
the decor was mainstream for brunch we ate pasta and egg benedicte with extra salmon on it the salmon was watery and the pasta was over cooked the staff was not very helpful it was an overall bad restaurant experience .
my fav i have been there 10 times and all were my best time bar tender tom is awesome he always treat us best if you expect good drinks to be made then this is the best place .
used a groupon for this place on a visit to nyc the service was poor and the salad i ordered with chicken was flavorless i would not come back here even with the groupon price i do not recommend this place .
out standing food everytime the sauerbraten is great as is their veal dishes the place is very clean and the service is always very good i remember when they were in berkeley heights and they were great then as well .
45 minutes to prepare a salad a sandwich and a mediumrare burger ive had quality food at busier restaurants with less wait time lucky they received a tip at all .
great service so so food .
never again staff and owner have a dontcare attitude took forever to order or get our check the food is overrated dont go .
im no expert at german food but i had the hunter schnitzel from their oktoberfest specials for dinner and it was amazing .
if i wrote for 40 minutes i could not express how pissed off they made me on saturday when i waited that long for food that never showed up one star for the free beer though .
great german every septoct they have an awesome octoberfest the pub is blah but if you like germanaustrian food theyve got great snitzel and spaetzle sp .
ive had better .
we had our wedding at pheasants landing a year ago people are still talking about how good the food was the staff was phenomenal everything was perfect the grounds are beautiful and i would recommend them to anyone without hesitation for special occasions .
the management at this place is out of their minds after making an order for delivery over 50 this place wants you to give them your credit card number but wont except credit cards for delivery cash only on deliveries that doesnt make any sense .
food is tasty and reasonable priced love their picadinho .
great drinks decor but the meat in my dish chicken pork was cold very chewy .
excellent food drinks and atmosphere we had brunch and nothing we ordered disappointed we licked our plates clean our waiter was informative and friendly try the steak and eggs delicious .
really bland and overpriced if youre going to charge 19 for enchiladas they really should be better good guacamole but not worth sitting through the main course .
very modern atmosphere inviting customer service welcoming atmosphere veggie lasagna rolls are amazingly good as appetizers fries top off the pork and compliment every entree veggie pasta is rich and strong lovely dinner .
probably the worst food i have eaten however all is not lost just walk across the road and go to empellon taqueria .
great brunch for the weekend but nice spot for a late night drink as well friendly staff definitely has become a favorite .
the food not as tasty as in the past also more expensive the guacamole had pieces of the outer skin mixed in disappointed .
awesome food cool place great service one of phillys best .
guacamole was brown had to ask twice for our drinks walked out after 30 mins of awful service and food place is an absolute joke .
great beer selection good and strong drinks nice and well executed menu solid on all fronts .
food is great but service is awful if youre looking for good tacos and margaritas try empellón right down the street .
good barrestaurant smaller menu but everything on it his high quality and its hard to go wrong their menu changes a lot so you can usually try something new .
michelada is fake ass fuck .
hands down the best burger ive ever had the stuffed burger on the brunch menu 14 braised short ribs mushrooms blue cheese truffle fries is a must try .
terrible food guac had old avocados ceviche tasted like old fish rice was gross and undercooked mole tasted like burnt hersheys chocolate syrup the chicken was yummy though .
surprisingly cool nice atmosphere great staff had the bruschetta with wine at the bar and id do it again .
this place is terrible in service and food it was a long wait to bring the order even guacamole which is always the fists thing on hand besides it was tasteless the rest was way too spicy and some ingredients were missing overall we left unsatisfied .
service is great food is delicious food comes very quickly and is extremely tasty would definitely recommend for families or couples .
made reservations on open table our table was in the walkway concert hall loud with no lighting we yelled our conversation at each other for five mins and decided to leave its not bar loud its club loud .
i would come here again and again the elk burger was amazing the atmosphere is low key and hipster the service was reasonable and the prices are great even the burger wrapped in collard greens was delicious i cant wait to go back .
food was fair they go very heavy on the chilis service was worse than awful restaurant was louder than a megadeath concert on the plus side bathrooms were very clean and attractive loudest restaurant i have ever been in should be called offenda .
the best burgers ever the milkshakes are delicious and they just got their liquor license .
while the food is excellent i cant overcome the presence of cockroaches and as we were attending to kill it the bartender joked about it they just increased the price on their drinks but havent bothered to take care of the infestation .
the grind house burger was pretty good the service was excellent the server was an expert of the menu and was very personable really blown away by the service on a weekday during lunch .
how overrated can you get this place is another hartford eatery that rips you off for really ordinary comfort food check out their meatloaf if you think im kidding really a marty mcgillicuddy chumpfest .
omg this is my new favorite burger place i love the variety of meats elk bison boar amazing all organic and fresh my suggestions is to get a burger and share so everyone can try a different burger .
i got food poisoning from this restaurant never come again service slow and overpriced i definitely never go there again .
great organic turkey burgers use to frequent the one in brooklyn so glad they are in philly now .
not a good first experience expected more or at least 3 stars no brown rice option only this koreanstyle mixed rice that makes the experience all the more less authentic japanese price was too high for quality wont be coming back .
more vegan options than i expected the collard green wrapped farmstead was hardier than expected .
its in a basement not a clean crisp japanese look overall the place is kind of dark and cluttered sushi and sashimi is ok average service seems to be yale coeds who have to work but dont enjoy it weve got far better sushi in columbus ohio .
to update the business owner has been in contact and has apologized and made up for it overall the bareburger experience in center city does have potential to be a good restaurant to check out .
severely overpriced meager portions an unoriginal menu and they dont take amex shame go to miso if youre in the market for traditional japanese sushi within new haven .
great place good burgers our server ron was very nice and the place had great decor sweet potato fries were also tasty .
the truth is that i cant find a great sushi place in new haven this place is okay no better or worse than the other sushi places i have tried in the area ill save my sushi cravings for new york .
i love bare burger because they not only have delicious food but also excellent service they were very understanding and were happy to make my order to my specifications even though it took longer happily recommend it to everyone .
disappointed the food was dry lomo the fish was old will not be coming back .
dont go anywhere else i like my burgers in assorted verity and bareburger hooked it up personally i frequently enjoy everything rare and bareburger understood what i mean highly recommend it must visit .
one of the better pizza places around my only issue with them is the prices they are way too high great hot subs the gelato looked like it had been sitting there for months i think they are the only pizza place that doesnt deliver .
love this new place fantastic new spot with many glutenfree and vegan options as well as exotic sustainable meats for carnivorous foodies many salads and sides in addition to burgers best of all organic everything service was fantastic and ambiance is fun .
took over 40 minutes for the pizza to get to our table it was only 1240pm so you know it wasnt busy i can have pizza delivered to my house for less than that time ridiculous .
really cute new burger joint kind of a rustic grey decor that sets the tone for its exotic array of beef elk boar and goat burgers i had the elk and it was fantastic .
i remember when this place opened i used to always get the empanadas they were so good but now they got smaller and its not the same anymore .
best burger in the city beats good stuff and village whisky for me cant wait until they can serve beer too .
meh late dinner friday night service was meh food took long wasnt hot thats not ketchup i dont know wtf that is reverse happy hour 1011 was a good look too bad drinks took 15 minutes to hit the table wont go again .
bareburger has finally made it to philly this place looks incredible and the new menu is amazing i had the wiki wiki with wild boar and the sprouts and roots salad friendly staff and great service .
not crazy about this spot food was soso service poor only 2 beers on tap wont be going out of my way again to go here .
great lunch at reviver today good addition to the nabe we had the carolina bbq chicken and the balkan burger which is in a pita both were great and flavorful portions are not large but well portioned would go back and try some of the other items .
unfortunately im obligated to give this place a rating so deeply dissapointed by management they really know how to make their customers never come back .
interesting take on healthy fast casual you really cannot go wrong here .
ok i love this place it has great food the staff is nice and its very pretty but was having lunch here today and saw a tiny cockroach in the wall eeeeek gross .
great spot for lunch shrimp tacos were amazing .
worst pizza i ever had in ny the dough was horrible incredibly dry it wasnt just me it was the whole table its a shame since the place is very nice they have a garden a nice wine list and service was ok .
delicious food that is also fast and healthy clean and bright but a bit sterile dining room friendly service will return .
very limited choice on food plus the service im already speechless however the back yard garden was amazing .
this place is just what the neighborhood needs the balkan burger was delicious eggplant provie had tons of flavor easy to order friendly service .
this place wanted a credit card to take a reservation for three people for saturday afternoon lunch who does that its lunch its three people its not some private party for 25 that takes a huge amount of prep work we switched to otto .
fast easy delicious and knowledgable im celiac and felt completely at ease enjoying the healthiest fast food lunch ive ever had yummy .
the outdoor patio is pretty cool and the prices extremely reasonable the menu is pretty simple with pizza and standard italian nothing too clever had very poor experience with rude service dont plan on going back .
lots of gluten free paleo or paleoish stuff not crazy priced nice people working here too very happy with the mahi mahi curry nice to get some legit real well flavored food and all under 20 for a solid meal solid find .
food was ok customer service was horrible refused to close the window on cold windy days .
just ate here for first time last week and am very impressed the food is healthy affordable tasty and filling i ordered in the restaurant for takeaway waited less than 5 minutes for food to be ready i will definitely be eating here again .
nice relaxing place but not good food .
outstanding healthy quality food im always looking for more healthy places in this neighborhood and im so glad i found this i had a tofu salad and my friend had a sandwich which she really liked very impressed with this place and hope they succeed .
so dissatisfied came here a long time ago and had the best burger in my life i have told everyone about this place only to return and find out the quality went straight down hill dont eat here seriously .
fresh healthy tasty quick solid variety and reasonably priced great spot to pick up for central parkcolumbus circle or dine in .
cuban tgi fridays bar is a fun place to share a drink but food is not worth your us dollars .
gotta love yelp got a nice cup of fresh green iced tea for checking in i ordered the balkan very good wholesome sandwich nice amount of spice and very fresh tasting the pickles on the side were nice too .
maybe i keep getting the wrong thing but so far the salmon salad and the rope steak have done nothing for me esp for the price and the atmosphere is stuffy and the sangrias are weak yuca chips are good though .
healthy fast and tasty could eat here 5 days a week .
as an update my dining buddy and best friend actually got food poisoning from this restaurant the day after fyi .
great fresh and nutritious food for a really reasonable price served by really personable people love it had the carolina bbq chicken and cream of cauliflower soup wish they had these in texas well done reviver .
okay place wine is okay and food is expected if a chain atmosphere more of a sports bar then italian okay for a fun night out with no expectations of great italian .
amazing food if you havent tried it youre really missing out soo many healthy choices theres something for everybody the food is very flavorful and unique and not too expensive either definitely check this place out if your tired of the same old food choices .
weve been lui lui fans since 93 im so sorry to see the quality drop so quickly since marc milowski left the partnership food is bland and the service is sporadic .
all i had was the green iced tea but the vibe and attitude is great will be back for food after 630 .
met my sister there last night 730 pm and by 830 pm the servers were putting the chairs on top of the tables i guess it was time to go the food was great as usual but i didnt feel the friendly atmosphere like i usually do .
amazing i ate here 3 times when i was in nyc mahi curry fish tacos and the tofu salad were superb great flavor please please please open in la we could really use some good tasting food here .
the rudest stuff in nyc the food is ok but every time i come here i am watching how the servers running around at the edge of a nerve break down ready to snap at the customers .
absolutely my favorite late night food spot the tacos are literally to kill for they chicken is my least favorite but the others more than make up for it try the quac also its amazing .
nasty waitstaff they are happy to repeat their policy rather then trying to be the least bit helpful if you want to overpay for food and be abused at the same time this is the place .
amazing burritos and sauces and friendly staff sat at the bar where you could watch them make your food they were so nice and friendly even though it was a ridiculous time of night .
sucks .
this spot is one of our regulars they have great tacos and sauces and cheap beer the only thing i wish they had were better tortilla chips the ones they have seem like the thick store bought kind other than that this place rocks .
lobster rigatoni wasnt fresh lobster was a weird purple color and smelled and tasted very fishy service was horrible i cant overstate how horrible new orleans mussels were good but not good to compensate for everything else avoid .
excellent tacos reminiscent of the ones everyone craves in l a served fast by nice staff great sauces with kick too .
i walked past wild edibles after work and thought it look like a good place to order dinner from not so much my tilapia was scorched it was so dry and overcooked that it was stiff it didnt seem like my boyfriend enjoyed his dry fish either .
hands down best tacos i have had in new york go hungry go with with a friend order all five and try a bit of each you will not regret it .
lacking in ambience and focus couldnt tell if it was trying to be a bar or a fish counter .
great little taco shops cheap and very good beer the vegetarian taco is a real surprise and the sauces make the tacos .
went with 2 friend for lunch and we had some oysters as starter and 3 different entrees mussels linguine and a tuna burger yeah it was edible but thats the best to say about it i wouldnt recommend it to a friend .
always great to go to five tacos for a quick bite or a meal tacos are so good workers are super friendly .
ill sum it up for you in one statement food was good but service sucked come on one person and a bartender for serving people try somewhere else .
the veggie taco was amazing definitely the best vegetarian taco ive had in ny im not a meat eater but my friend loved the chicken tacos the veggie taco can also be vegan if you ask for no cheese will definitely be eating here again .
not worth the money definitely overpriced i ordered the homemade cavetelli and it was bland especially the meat i should of listened to the other reviews stating that it is overpriced do yourself a favor skip this place and dont become another victim like me .
everything is really good here i especially like getting the platos which is a ton of food even there tacos are pretty filling ingredients are well seasoned and fresh love the diablo sauce but be careful wish they had shrimp too but ill deal .
pizza is extremely thing soggy and the crust on their pizzas always come out burnt the sauce tastes like ketchup and the cheese has a chewiness to it .
this place is amazing everything from their sour cream to their hot sauces to their guacamole is home made from scratch and you can tell the tacos are huge for the price and they are open late best taco in ny .
meh is exactly how i would describe this heard so much about new haven style pizza that we wanted to give it a go when driving through price was reasonable but have had much better pizza in my life .
fresh and delicious tacos theyre quite big and very fairly priced the staff is super nice definitely get the pulled pork tacos so juicy place is open till 4am which is a big plus .
tastes like home cooking from your friends mom the only problem is your friends mom isnt a very good cook .
tasty tacos are scarce in this town this place definitely deserves recognition for theirs fresh ingredients plentiful servings and on top of that cheap and quick easy enough to stop by for a snack or stay for a meal do it .
dos esquis taps with matching glass park avenue prices pint size portions ceviche awaits not tonight sorry he says yet kitchen staff eats seafood treats gratuity included for party of eight early fridays no wait reviewhaikus .
great place for a quick hole in the wall taco place that serves beer and amazing hot sauce prices are very reasonable and make for a fun cheap easy night out for tacos and beer will absolutely come back .
ok mexican food had the fish tacos were relatively good but nothing amazing .
i have to come here every week because its so delicious and cheap start feeling hungry when writing this review already .
super over priced and pretty middling food i didnt like that they charged 2 dollars for tiny portions of salsa or hot sauce without telling telling you it was extra i will say it has a decent happy hour drink special .
13 for a butternut squash burrito draft beer and an incredable variety of sauces yes please the habenero jack sauce is actually spicy well done .
eeeeek salt lick guac priced at a smidgeon chips stale for a pigeon fish tacos fried to be a paper weight i regret everything that i ate .
excellent casual neighborhood joint their squash taco is to die for very affordable .
okay everything is cooked from frozen prebattered or precooked mostly reheating food not really cooking slow service .
good simple tacos meat tender and tasty not much seating better to take out delivery or sit in the park devils hot sauce is good and top 5 hottest hot sauces not the best chips dinner 3 soft tacos chicken pork chorizo chips and salsa .
this place needs to take reservations thats ridiculous not to when they are so busy at 3pm they had over an hour wait for two people waited food was okay i wouldnt wait an hour for it again .
great place for those late night munches the different sauces they have are all amazing and unique .
posted in error .
some of the best tacos ive ever had very small place but make great food you can call ahead for pick up or order on seamless to make it quicker definitely worth a try .
disappointed with burger and fries .
amazing thats really the only word jay felipe and mike are fantastic but not quite as fantastic as their burritos get the chorizo .
literally waited 55 minutes for my burger at lunch n the place was less than half full burger finally came good but way too salty fries underwhelming will not be coming back .
we love five tacos one of the best authentic tacos in the city the owner is a very sweet and courteous person do try all different sauces coconut marsala is my favorite .
works well as a pub not so well as a restaurant long wait for a table by the employees entrance or the bathroom content to rest on their laurels .
simply delicious guac is so good and you get a lot for the price sauces are a great addition to the already perfect tacos small menu but everything is great .
had the burger medium cooked and all we could taste was blue cheese repeated on me all night fries were great burger wasnt worth the wait .
those were some great tacos get the chorizo and you wont regret it well your stomach might .
really not worth the wait and the poor service this has become one of manhattans least hidden tourist traps no locals would ever go there .
damn fine tacos served with love a great place guaca flocka flame .
poor service yucky fishy oysters slow kitchen arrogant waitstaff this is our second time here they wont get a third chance .
really good stuff chorizo tacos to die for .
overrated the food was greasy and gamey the server had major attitude on top of that it was expensive i dont mind paying for amazing food but this was just a waste of money .
great new spot very nice portions best taco spot among lots of competition .
smoked haddock chowder charbroiled burger salty salty salty tongue felt like i licked a salt block for an hour chowder was not fishy creamy but not thick overall overrated .
pricey for a single taco but they are stuffed well i got the chicken and used all the sauces it was definitely good enough on its own but i love sauces i hear the chorizo is excellent .
dined 814 short gray haired closing manager ruined the night refused to serve last call despite still being open then slammed door behind us once we left 1 star michelin my ass learn some hospitality or find a new job zero star rating if possible .
priced higher than tacos usually are but these have heft and flavor chorizo .
dont see what the hype is about had the burger which i could have made at home the server was annoyed and not helpful with questions we had .
love their tacos great for a beer and two tacos or burrito theyre huge and amazing nice staff make it in front of you and the different sauces you can put on your tacos are top notch .
i really wanted to love this place but the service was slow and the food not as good as i was hoping had two attempts before finally eating at this place as it is always so crowed love the pigs everywhere .
getting a burrito from here after a heavy night of drinking prevented a next day hangover this place is a miracle worker it should be studied by scientists to discover its magical properties .
do not waste your time or money here so below average the corned beef hash tastes like potatoes and salt we couldnt even taste the corned beef the mimosas are the tiniest ive had in manhattan unless you want to follow the hipster hype save yourself a trip .
really reallty good simple and delicous food for cheap what more can you want .
i love burgers unfortunately i get sick every time i eat here which has been 3 times great spot to go for drinks to hang out thats if there isnt a long wait .
chorizo taco beef taco and chicken quesadilla with hearty chips try the different sauces theyre delicious coming from california i was amazed .
overpriced over hyped and over crowded painfully average food and oh so trendy stay away and save your .
i dont even like tacos and i love these tacos seriously they are life changing do yourself a favor and check this out order the pork or the veggie and there is no going back the food is awesome as are the guys working the stand .
i have always been blasé about this place other than the bartender and waitresses having mad style and some excellent wines by the glass cant seem to get in to the hype of this joint .
this is my favorite spot on st marks pl i eat hear a couple of times a week i literally crave their veggie tacos they are the best ive ever had and the gauc is amazing very friendly great looking place just the best highly highly recommended .
let down by the service slow and their staggering philosophy does not work drinks were pricey nothing spesh pancakes were yummy but so many great places in ny means i wont be coming back .
great tacos great staff great service good beer would be five stars except for the awful repetitive depressing smiths pandora channel that is playing message to the management mix it up a little .
serversbartenders here are the worst ive never been treated more rudely particularly by a place i just dropped major cash at biggest attitudes ever .
the service is really friendly and the food is always great cheap beers on tap too .
a pretty good 10 burger too bad it cost 20 the fries are a joke can i have some mayonnaise we dont have mayonnaise this is a restaurant right the chef hates mayonnaise .
tacos tacos and more tacos please love this place totally fuels my intense taco addiction great and friendly staff cute nonpretentious atmosphere damn good beer what more could you want oh yes chorizo and cheese quesadillas mmmmmhmm .
shoddy service for a crap piece of cheese bread waited 80 min for table and 80 min for our meal at 1 pm outrageous .
this place just opened we went in by chanceand the foods were so delicious very reasonably priced nice staffs great tacos eatin and take out available highly recommended .
more like the spotted disappointment the fabled burger was dry and the only flavor came from the cheese and ketchup the scallops and corn were quite good but not enough to save the night youre better off at the breslin .
was wonderful authentic thai .
really dont understand what the fuss is about the menu is overly fancy the food is disappointingly bland and certain things are ridiculously overpriced small cup of average gazpacho for 16 no no no also im british but not much of this menu seems very british to me .
one of the best thai meals ive ever had the spicy fish sauce wings were incredible all of the flavors were unique and blended very well i look forward to coming back to this incredible establishment .
over priced and over seasoned food that took for ever to get delivered by unfriendly staff we were sat on the top floor and the lady who waited on us was almost humorously unfriendly crowd was mainly tourists .
have to say i was so happy and satisfied with my meal here the food was amazing one of the best ive had all year the drinks were delicious too .
i lived right up the street from this gastropub so blah i cant even tell you over rated and stuck up i was not impressed with their food and the ambiance was eh i will not be a returing customer .
best for two get 12 items and share .
rude manager host will take bribes to get you seated but will make you wait for two hours take the bribe money and never seat you never going again if i could give them a zero i would .
order the wings wash your hands take a sip of the rice water tear into them juicy chicken wings lick your fingers repeat i cant say im a fan of their sticky rice since ive had better but i am definitely a fan of their wings .
an overrated neighborhood eatery that charges a 10r for a pint cheese plate as ok service was good may have to try a redux .
cant stop going here the boars neck ask for well done is a top 10 nyc dish the wings the gin and linemade the outdoor seating place is dope .
pricey but its were the important people go example one egg cut in half six dollars yes a 6 egg .
crappy wait though food was great had the wings pork belly and shrimp salad there was a minced pork salad which was meh but still had a good experience nonetheless .
atmosphere is great but i thought the food was just ok had the cubano sandwich and it was dry and really not that impressive this place is so so and im not sure really worth the hype .
a very lovely dinner everything was amazing even the affogato i am def coming back and maybe grabbing a pok pok gift card .
i was super excited about this place but made the mistake of going on a monday night they ran out of everything on the menue the server was clearly in training and the fluke crudo was probably left over from the week before man what a disappointment .
loved this place it feels very authentic it definitely took me back to thailand the food was delicious but not amazing id come though again the whole feel of the place is about as authentic as it gets .
food very good quality it would be worth the price if the surroundings were nicer and the staff were friendlier long wait 1hr 40 mins good pub nearby white horse .
phenomenally interesting northern thai with friendly service and a great location its a bit pricey for brooklyn with smaller portions that are like tapas for sharing its a bit spicy if you like that i do some of the best thai ive had in the us .
people at the front door are such a holes that i wont be back ever .
cocktails were delish food was good good atmosphere prices are a little high location is a little out of the way .
it reached the summit a few years ago a has been at this point wish they had regular beers too but for 8 bucks a beer and tip i think il go fiddlesticks instead .
those wings though forget everything else .
nothing special id rather spend my money on other things deviled eggs were good but thats about it had the burger nothing special the gnudi was ok but i dont like this kind of pasta anyway i just dont think my pallete is suited for this restaurant .
everything was great cant wait to come back for dinner again loved the papaya salad and duck with mushrooms .
what happened this place lost its coolness factor more tourists i guess food has gotten worst as well ever since the office did a spot here its been going down hill since .
worth the wait food is amazing and enough options for vegetariansvegans as well as meat and fish new space is great and allows for easier seating best to be there when they open and line up out front to sit asap mushroom salad is to die for .
gastro pub hmmmm just gastro problems for me tiny overly pretetentious out of the way bad service boring food too crowded thanks for my rant .
brunch is not only really good but probably one of the most affordable brunches ive seen around would absolutely recommend .
i went there for a sunday brunch the waiter was nice and place is comfortable i tried the la selva but i feel that it is too brand i guess vegetarian food and venezuelan do not go well together .
this place i would recommend in a heart beat the bartenders are very friendly and personable the food is amazing all the time and the atmosphere is very inviting they will soon have outdoor space available but i cant say enough about this place .
the pabellano arepa and reina arepa was ok the hot chocolate was not that great small and expensive 8 50 .
space decor ambience drinks and service all great so comfortable i could spend too much time there food was pretty good i e not stellar but not pricey good value for the money .
first time here and its loud boring and the wait time is crazy if i had to come here again i would definitely bring my own bottle .
comfortable bar with a great rotating beer list and nice menu the s a l t sandwich is my favorite .
i found it terribly subpar my meal tasted like mmm fresh microwave i would not return nor would i recommend it to anyone really you could do much better for the money in my opinion .
world cup artichoke dip happy hour yes please this is a great bar and my only regret in writing this review is that its going to be crowded from now on the music is good and the scene is low key but not divey .
theyve changed the menu with fewer desirable options there was nothing i really wanted to even order they started off good when they opened but on our recent visit the food was lackluster nothing wrong with the service however .
always a solid draft selection served by solid bartenders food is surprisingly good my favorite being the roast pork sandwich with mac and cheese which is definitely worth paying the extra for .
remarkably slow service we ate at the bar three bartenders more interested in each other than the customers mediocre food the fried chicken was more like fancy chicken nuggets meh meh and more meh .
definitely a favorite in the neighborhood cozy lightfilled atmosphere very solid menu particularly brunch good beer selection friendly attentive staff good music looking forward to the garden next summer .
the restaurant is an absoute failure no decent meals on the menu not a place to go with your family and definitely not your date .
a lovely space good menu inexpensive drinks during happy hours and nice folks draws a nice crowd definitely my new goto spot in the neighborhood .
i have to say this is one of my biggest disappointments i used to love eating here the last 34 times i have been have been mediocre i always leave there hungry .
the mac n cheese is actually quality real quality im pretty damn impressed fuck its delicious and amazing fuck 4 happy hour drinks till 8pm that is my update .
went here for lunch and had a perfectly adequate but not in any way exceptional lunch meal because it was a working lunch no booze was consumed so ill not say anything about that .
space decor ambience drinks and service all great so comfortable i could spend too much time there food was pretty good i e not stellar but not pricey good value for the money .
meh save yourself the trouble and just go to kraftwork menu is weird expensive and the atmosphere is cold uninviting .
the food is superb for bar food the drinks are good and reasonably priced especially during happy hour the service is pleasant .
although i love pretty much anything that has to do with whiskey im giving this place a thumbs down overpriced and underwhelming the ambiance is super contrived i typed that even at the risk of sounding like a huge douchnozzle and the wait staff are useless .
our brunch today was delicious the service was great the space lovely the only thing negative to say is the servings were small for the price but we will go back .
had the cheese plate that was pretty boring and staff arent appropriately dressed if you are trying to be phillys answer to a brooklyn whiskey bar please dress the part because you just look like slobs serving 12 00 drinks .
this is the neighborhood bar ive been waiting years for big comfortable space friendly bartenders not too loud overpriced pretentious annoying nerdy weird just a rad normal bar and good happy hour specials too so happy this is here .
went for dinner last night the beef stew tasted burnt my friends welldone burger was black disappointing .
i dont know why other patrons only gave this place three stars it was very clean the good was great and the help was friendly a good find .
my company and i used to order from this place all the time the portions used to be huge they are not anymore the delivery time is always extensive and the owner or whoever answers their phone is rude will not be ordering from them again .
the lady there was very nice she explained the different type of wine the ones she recommended were a hit with the ladies thank you .
i went here once on a recommendation it is a hole in the wall place which i dont mind but the food did not make up for the lack of ambience i remember ordering meatballs and they were not cooked evenly .
great place its a little corner deliliquor store the sandwiches are phenomenal they use great bread and quality meat they have a great beer selection too if your in the area definitely give it a try .
do you enjoy paying for something you something you didnt order well this is the place for you .
i love this place though a bit on the expensive side this is my go to liquor store and where i go to grab a coffee or a sandwich for breakfast or lunch delicious sandwich menu and prepared salads .
went in to grab a quick lunch and they had nothing left after tossing everything for the day they werent supposed to close for another two hours they reluctantly scrounged up a grilled cheese for me .
cool little wine bar with some good tapas sized entrees definitely worth coming to .
i heard stories about this place but needed to judge for myself unfortunately the stories were true cockroaches enough said .
best mac and cheese in manhattan bartenders are are great wines are priced right with huge selection .
this place is absolutely disgusting and is run very poorly a definite waste of time and money spare yourself .
friendly staff aaaaawesome food there charcuterie plate is very good and the flatbread pizza is a 1010 .
i ordered their famous hot wings and when they came out i took a bite then quickly realized they were cold in the middle gross never again .
mac n cheese .
a few days ago i was there i didn t have a good time there friends told me it was a good place but i have different view the only good thing there is the service two stars for good service .
great food ambiance and experience only complaint was that the music was way too loud otherwise it was the perfect place to get a latenight bite to eat .
beautiful restaurant on passyunk ave my complaint is that the portions are too small for the price .
really great food excellent service and fun lively environment but not ideal for a group greater than 6 people .
what happened the food used to be fabulous and on my last visit it was clearly several levels down very disappointing pasta was odd meats dry and basically good ideas poorly executed ingredients seemed less fresh too bad .
really freaking loud sat at the bar and had some drinks but could barely hear what i was saying good date spot but might want a plan b in case you start going deaf .
food was good but wasnt satisfied with the customer service would never eat here again very disappointed especially the female manager is rude as hell .
awesome charcuterie good selection of wine good atmosphere will definitely return .
was not really feeling the atmosphere the drinks are super expensive for what you get not enough attention paid to us while we were there so we just had drinks and left wont be back .
this is a cute little wine bar with great charcuterie and pizzas my favorites were the smoked gouda and the pizza with proscuitto and arugula they have some reasonably priced bottles of wine .
food is okay service is awful not worth the time to visit .
romantic atmosphere on the ues to have some wine and intimate conversation they have a really good happy hour from 47pm and delicious flatbreads the service was excellent and the staff was very kind .
sadly no where near as good as it once was from service to pizza this establishment had gone downhill in the last year b .
i came for an afternoon snack of wine and cheese we got the chefs assortment of cheese and the chefs assortment of meat the waitress knew the menu very well and was extremely accommodating and friendly would definitely go back .
probably the worst experience i have had at a popeyes after a 10 minute wait for a simple combo meal which i never got i gave up and had to argue to get my money back the employees were indifferent and rude terrible .
such a great little place the staff was super friendly helpful and i loved how they didnt let our water glasses go empty the chefs choice cheese plate was really generous for 19 and was good for 2 people .
i never write reviews especially on fast food but this was the slowest and rudest places ive been to a long time .
cute romantic great service id recommend .
wow that sucked rude employees who even went so far as to take off their name tags no fries not much choice of chicken pieces no butter and no manager ended up hungry with a refund .
the bartender was lovely so was the wine .
great food horrible customer service bad attitudes standoffish and unpleasant food is very good however which makes this bittersweet .
great selection of wines and a wonderful cheese platter service was amazing if your near 72nd and columbus you need to make a stop here .
meh go somewhere else the food is mediocregross depending upon what you get drinks okay .
they opened their doors mere minutes after our sweet little flash wedding in the park the prosecco was flowing the food was amazing and they made our special night one that we will never forget thank you xxoo .
mediocre food and we behaved badly here so i wont be back .
the hubby and i got away from the teens for an hour to enjoy a really great cheese plate and a nice glass of prosecco i really like the atmosphere and the bartender was friendly and quick with our water refills .
very disappointed smothered chicken was too salty and yams were canned oxtails were extremely small for the price overall customer service was great but thats about it money wasted wont be returning ever again .
wonderful neighborhood gem great selection of wine and flatbread pizza highly recommend for intimate gatherings and parties .
i have not had a chance to try the food been waiting for 212 hrs for take out just a bunch of smiling and being called up to the counter for the wrong order .
great wines both by glass and bottle ambiance was delightful and the service was attentive good prices too solid overall make a date set up a meeting with friends grab a chair inside outside or at the counter facing the street for a good time .
disappointing service scallops tasted strange and experienced some major gi upset that night of note so did the other member in the party that also had scallops would never go back so many wonderful spots in the city with better food and better service .
one of my favorite restaurants in the city dont miss the muscles they are to die for i moved to away from the neighborhood years ago and we still visit riposo often .
this place is dirty there needs to be an inspection done i swear we saw cockroaches near the kitchen door area and the beer selection is pretty bad no parking what so ever and .
this place is really charming i had the warm bread and olive oil and coffee to start off and then a panini with parmesan and truffle oil all of it was absolutely delicious and wasnt ridiculously overpriced i will be returning .
loud sports bar replete with a television every three inches mounted fish and other assorted game on the walls and a jukebox limited drink selection though i suppose if youre into the budweiser repertoire you might be happy too few tables as well .
good wine selection enough space that you arent overcrowded easy to get to location on uws .
the indian here is ok but not as good as some other indian restaurants in town for the price i am not too impressed the service is good the menu selection is decentbut lacking a few staples .
went back again same great service thanks vickie and awesome food .
as far as the indian restaurants in the area go masala grill just isnt up to speed the food is always a bit on the greasy side and not flavorful enough i miss twist rojo which used to be in that spot .
the cozy neighborhood wine bar offers a fantastic array of wines and delicious flatbreads the raised tables are perfect for an intimate gathering of friends and the place is small enough to feel like home .
no decor to speak of expensive dirty silverware food was ok but there are plenty of cheaper cleaner and better tasting options in the area .
went here several times while in college great greasy cheesesteaks was my first in the city and still one of my favorites calm atmosphere not very pretty but food makes up for it .
the food here isnt particularly good and neither is the service the only thing masala grill has going for it is location its ok thats all .
i got the cheesesteak which was pretty good im not from philly and dont know what an amazing cheesesteak tastes like but i thought what i got was pretty good it was pricey though 7 for basically a hot dog bun onions beef and sauce .
we waited 3 hours for our food to come ridiculously horrible service would never go back or recommend .
the best cheesesteaks in philly i know thats a controversial statement but i dont think it is even close chopped meat cooked perfectly with onions peppers and provolone is my preferred version and service is almost always friendly a novel concept for some cheesesteak establishments .
ok service and my everything bagel is always lacking everything but otherwise just a place to grab your breakfast on your way to work if no time for anywhere else .
i went to this place to have a cheese steak while i visited upenn campus the food here was great i also had onion rings and it was just okay .
horrible the place is not clean and the staff do not wear gloves between preparing the food and handling money i will not go back there are other places in the area that are cleaner and have bagels that are just as good if not better .
excellent cheesesteaks convenient to wharton school at penn easy in and even long lines move quickly friendly staff but delicious steaks recommend with onions peppers and whiz .
thought i was down south definitely not healthy food served here creamed chipped beef steakums from the food store canned vegetables ever heard of fresh real and healthy if your not a regular a local or like low quality food forget it drive on .
oooey gooey greasy and meaty all the elements of my perfect cheesesteak tourists go to pats n genos ill pass on both lunchtime can mean a little of a wait youll need plenty of napkins eating here .
a nice place yet the food didnt went right it might be only me cause the place was very busy .
good cheesesteak i enjoyed one with waffle fries my tapeworm loved it had one from genos and pats i liked this one better i would recommend if you are near here to stop in and grab one .
yelp reviews in this instance were completely misleading i have been to many ramen places in the city and this one ranks at the bottom of the list good toppings and noodle texture but the broth was completely bland and flavorless .
a staple during my college years at drexel i ordered a cheesesteak today about 10 years since my last visit and its just as good as i recall .
decent ramen blah service expensive coke stick with water coke comes in small glass bottle for 3 bf got wahoo which was much better than the basic pork ramen i wish i had gotten that and cash only who does that anymore .
best cheesesteak in philly the bread is what makes the sandwich perfectly greasy always fresh make sure you tip them a dollar or more and they take care of you if i had to have one grease meal before i died this would be it .
not a fan and my other girlfriend wasnt either of the ramen and the soup base i just liked my chicken chasu the pork gyoza was nothing spectacular service was good and the lady was nice enough to let us sit before our friend came in limited seating .
i like this place better than genos and pats the cheesesteaks and the other sandwiches are worth the ride .
dont expect to enjoy your meal here because after you are done the check will be on your table without asking and the cunt waitresses will come by every 15 seconds to get their money .
first time having a cheesesteak in philly and i gotta say it was awesome staff was friendly and courteous service was expedient and the food was great will be back in the future .
on my first visit i ordered the tsukemen it was like huge and price was just right but the broth that came with the ramen was pretty much cold .
abners is great staple for penn and drexel in university city no need to travel all the way to south philly for pats or genos when abners is in the backyard .
kambi .
hands down the best sandwich ever you get to watch them cook it right before your eyes .
ive been here twice the first time i thought it was amazing thats because i was already drunk the second time i tasted minca for what it is a poor excuse for ramen overly salty poor quality noodles and general averageness .
great spot for a quick and delicious cheesesteak before going to the rave for a movie or anywhere else in university city easy parking and great food but i have to specifically note their customer service always accommodating and friendly .
maybe because i had the pork broth but this was not very good even my wifes chicken broth with salt was nothing special its a walk from the train wife kept complaining about the walk also only cash which kinda sucks .
love these cheesesteaks .
totally overrated both the food and the service bad management in terms of seating customers ramen is below average ippudo and other ramen places at st marks are far better .
great cheesesteaks ive only ordered delivery from abners but every time i have been surprised by how fast our food got to our apartment .
wouldnt go back very bland and thick noodles moyashi salad was just not good .
abners gets a solid 4 the past 2 times ive been there the cheesesteak has been phenomenal prior experiences were not so great maybe they have turned over a new leaf only gripe bread was not the best imo a little too weak .
meh is exactly what minca is salty kinds goupy soup ramen broth should never be this thick .
my favorite cheesesteaks in philly by far well ok jims is close but abners is a direct descendant of jims you can all go to pats or genos but for me nothing compares to abners .
what is everyone talking about very traditional bland ramen with nothing standing out we ordered their ramen tsukemen kakuni with rice and everything was very underwhelming thank god we were lucky we didnt have to wait that long that night .
thank you abners for being so great the cheesesteaks and chickensteaks are delicious without being too greasy and the service is excellent .
the ramen is freaking amazing but the cockroaches are everywhere the cockroaches are more than the customers .
i dunno about any of the other reviews but ive always had a good cheesesteak here i remember going here when i was 15 or 16 and it was the cool thing because we would get a beer with our cheesesteaks .
look ramen is a pretty big deal to me its like totally a huge part of my life no seriously seriously minca is dece if youre in a pinch but it definitely doesnt rock socks plus the sake and beer selection is overpriced and sucky bumma .
our reliable goto place food is excellent for what it is not gourmet but it doesnt pretend to be we always sit at the bar and have great service love their 9 99 fried shrimp and balsamic chicken dinners an excellent value .
ippudo .
great diner breakfast i had the goldroc omelet and it was so good i had it again the second time back .
the ramen here is alright nothing to rant about the broth is very flavorful but tastes very fatty at the same time the noodles are fresh and tasty the pork is just ok ive had better ramen elsewhere .
the food and wine were outrageously delicious and fabulous we would have liked a bit more attention from the waitstaff but otherwise we thought it was pretty terrific .
i like that theyre local and producing better quality ramen in nyc but if i went to a truck stop in japan and got the ramen i get here id just be pleasantly surprised in other words ramen from minca is like finding a good dennys in japan .
really intimate and wine cellar atmosphere with good service and decent selection of wines food is great happy hour is great with 5 wines and stella .
misoramen soup not enough kick to it noodles lacked the koshi and was easy to go soggy gyoza not bad but the skin wasnt strong and crispy enough chirpy waitress pass .
chill spot good wine selection cold beer too .
sadly this is not real ramen and also me n my husband got diarrhea after we ate ramen sorry not recommend this place .
great spot came for my sisters birthday with a group of ten very accommodating just had to make a reservation a couple weeks out charged 15 for cake cutting plating reasonable wine prices delicious cheese plate and great staff .
dont go on monday evening when the horrible overamplified singers take over the place the ice cream is good but not worth the aural pain .
this is my favorite place for drink meetings as well as social it is quiet and intimate with a good selection of food and drink and a great happy hour .
blt on wheat toast should be easy mine tasted like the toast was made last week weak .
food was great and very affordable our server was attentive and knowledgeable it was really humid and warm in there and caused everything to sweat and that would be my only complaint we loved it and had a great time .
ice creams okay but pretty overpriced for crappy service and small quantities i would recommend going somewhere else .
large selection of wine desserts are great as well lots of snacks you can choose from good for groups .
been going here for years mainly for ice cream but on occasion for food tonight was the last visit for dinner they have lost me on quality vs price paid i will not get ripped off again the ice cream is great but pass on the food .
good place low key and can make any company great company .
this place is only for ice cream do not order a meal from here i ordered a salad and all the ingredients were old it looked gross .
great wine selection great food great ambiance .
too expensive to be so mediocre there is lots to choose from here and a nice dairy bar but the price does not equal the quality .
i love this spot .
disgusting food and those that cook it had breakfast this morning eggs came out raw twice and sausages burnt so bad that they fell apart too cheap for them to take it off the bill .
decent prices for bottles of wine the annabella cabernet sauvignon was my favorite of the evening the cheese plates are a must cute little spot to take a date or hang with your favorite winos and cheese addicts .
ordered the pastrami but it was dry and had no flavor and not slices but small chunks wasnt worth eating .
highly recommend excellent food excellent wine and beer selection reasonable prices and great ambience highly recommend .
not a real jewish deli knish is terrible pastrami on rye is mediocre mustard is not even that good .
great first date atmosphere definitely recommend the bacon wrapped scallops as well .
order a half a pound of chicken salad to take home was charges for a half pound of salad when i got home was a half of a sandwich .
really cozy place love the atmosphere its a little stuffyhot though haha large parties are seated in the back which is surprising there are couches the wine and small plates selection are decent the mushroom truffle risotto was really good .
mediocre and very dry sliced way too thick and served on dry rye bread knish was good and made me add a second star friendly service .
came here after brunch and we were able to enjoy the happy hour 57 deal the prosecco was great its also a very cozy setting great place for some casual drinks with friends or a date .
10 for a pastrami sandwich i would hope it would be tender and melt in your mouth for that price but it was rather chewy if i go back ill give the corned beef a try maybe .
romantic spot on the les nice wine selection food is solid too i have been here 23 times and its never packed will definitely return again .
this is perhaps the shittiest brisket ive ever eaten in my life so dry and bland i had to douse it in mustard if i ate it there i wouldve returned it .
great wine cool atmosphere great bites and great overal spot .
noooooot keen at all .
really good food a very loungey place good for date night .
whoever gives this a high review really does not know deli they keep their meats under a heat lamp which helps dry them out if you want real deli go to famous or somewhere else a disappointment .
great atmosphere cool decora great place to meet up for a date or drinks with friends the sancerre white wine was very delicious starters were small but reasonable priced oscar salad was quite good wait staff was attentive and courteous i would definitely go back .
food is fabulous layout of the customer service line is poor clearly front staff have not been trained no eye contact no acknowledgment do know their own menu risky business for the owner .
squeeze me squash me make me wine reads the cheeky sign behind the bar this is the perfect date spot for wining and late dining yet also a great place to chit chat with a few girl friends .
drive all the way from jersey and they closed early at 5 instead of the posted time of 7pm highly disappointed .
i absolutely love this place food is delicious 5 glass of prosecco 4 stella are great prices i love the decor the atmosphere the location and the service its a cozy and very charming place to catch up with friends or for a date .
overpriced coffee served to you in chic read chipped coffee mugs ordered a sandwich and a cup of coffee and it was 20 00 then had to stand to eat it cause their rocking chairs around tables were taken hipster haven .
super cozy bar great selection of wine cheese meat and dessert love .
reviewing cappuccino only i know this one opened recently but the cappuccino is not as good as the one by the ritz bitter not enough milk and temperature was too hot i would love if this got fixed because its a beautiful space .
great spot took my girlfriend for her birthday our lovely waitress was all smiles and picked out a great wine for us she even picked the charcuterie and cheese we were happy campers .
meh its really cool inside but pricey and the coffee isnt my thing food is okay but id rather frequent the older mom pop coffee shop two doors down .
good place for a date decent food great decor and good service its a great french restaurant tucked away in china town highly recommended .
food is ok but expensive .
escargot and mushroom puffs in little italy cute rustic place with patrons who like to stand instead of sit good for me romantic but too loud .
not worth the time their phone system is horrible you wait and then it disconnects you very disappointed and the staff has an attitude when you do get through so many restaurants so little time for this do not waste your time as i did big disappointment .
came here with a few coworkers to grab some wine prices arent that bad for the area also there dark atmosphere setting makes it a great place if you need a place for a date night the service was good too .
the only good thing about this place is that they are open late their pizza is not good at all go to mr dinos instead .
relaxed atmosphere good reasonable wine list and good cheese charcuterie .
beyond disgusting i ordered a slice of penne pizza and a soda sat down to eat when a huge roach ran across my plate then the staff acted like that is ok .
best wine bar way over on the east side and pretty out of the way thus less populated than its peers great wine fantastic music and warm atmosphere good couches in the back a new fave .
i visit this pizzeria out of convenience the slices are ok not that tasty .
surprisingly good food .
maybe this place is great if you like indian food but if you go for thai youll be disappointed the curry was overly thick and strangely flavored the free dessert was a dunkin donuts munchkin soaked in cinnamon water gross .
my favorite wine bar in the city delicious and not heinously expensive the cheese platters are awesome the green grapes are a nice touch ambiance is great and service is super friendlyespecially the french guy .
cafe lutecia is a sweet little cafe its food is okay but nothing that impressive unfortunately the cafe is so cramped and uncomfortable that its impossible to truly enjoy yourself here unless you grab a table outside .
huge fan i went here after a few mediocre places this place saved the night the atmosphere is super cozy the wine list is delish had the malbec it was super tasty and the food is awesome you cant go wrong .
i only order 2 dishes they r really really terrible too salty and not like sichuan food at all 反正如果是四川重庆的大概不会喜欢这家店 醋溜土豆丝用白醋，酸的很奇怪。火锅鱼就是火锅底料­做的，鱼片和手指头差不多厚 这些菜还没自己在家里做的好吃也是醉了 .
its like being in a cellar dim dark brick walls good affordable wines ill be back .
ordered pad thai to go and it was very poor dry barely spicey with rubbery mushrooms .
this place has a great ambienceatmosphere and great service the drinks are really delicious too i would recommend it for happy hour after work or a gathering with friends its definitely one of the better bars ive been to in nyc .
got takeout of three dishes all very bland in flavor and mushy .
so solid great wine at good prices generous charcouterie and cheese plates chill vibe ici on parle francais how could you miss this place may not be as good as it gets but tis the way things outta be .
17 pot beef was extremely oil way too spicy and overall disappointing the atmosphere is nice but the food leaves something to be desired .
nice little wine bar came here for a private gathering perfect space good apps and excellent service .
its aight id rather walk a tad bit and get real deals in chinatown .
what a great place for small plates and wine too bad our waitress was a turtle thats all i have to say about that .
attempted to go here for my friends birthday hostess told us it would be around a 30min wait we came back to the waiter telling us he actually cannot accommodate us so we waited for absolutely no reason and he just walked away without apologizing great service .
really crowded and small but the food is really good had the meat and cheese plate and some other small plates everything was delicious the lighting is romantic but the tight space and loudness makes it more of a place to get together with a few girlfriends .
my coworker and i decided to order ngam in for lunch i got the thai taco so greasy beyond greasy actually took the joy right out of what sounded like a good idea i doubt ill order from here again .
i went here when marshall stack was packed as always and found it to be on par with if not preferable to that place big tables good snack food friendly service wine and beer .
if i could give this place no stars even that would not be satisfactory waiter insulted friends about leaving a shitty tip when in actually left a nice 30 tip this has never happened anywhere else and i am severely disappointed with this establishments professionalism .
awesome happy hour really cute place cute decorations good wine selection .
ordered traditional pad thai with tofu the tofu was so tough made it hard to chew felt like it was frozen and recently thawed not what i would expect from this type of restaurant the fries are very good but didnt make up for subpar main dish .
half price glasses of wine on mondays holy fuck yes delicious nondescript appetizers .
ive been here three times and its been a consistent disappointment several of their items in the menu bordered on unpleasant i did have a curry which though small in portion was very good but thats about it .
great food slow service the wine selection will float your boat .
not impressed by the pad thai lunch special it was about 3 more expensive than competitors lunch packages and had nothing to recommend it l .
food was good and prices were right what more could you ask for .
over priced too much salt too much sugar did i say too much salt and too much sugar and overpriced .
cute the creme brulee was yum and although i cant comment much on the wine list i can say the decor and vibe has me excited to come back .
ordered delivery using the eat24 app i live literally two blocks away from the restaurant and it took 2 hours to reach me i kid you not food wasnt great either definitely not worth 13 for that special pad thai overall bad experience wouldnt recommend .
good ambiance solid cheese plate and delicious wine .
extremely disappointing green curry soup and coconut rice best avoided .
if you know what to order youll have a great time the staff is excellent and attentive the back seating area is nice for a gettogether with drinks and games this establishment is worth the time and money and their food is good .
i can only review this place based on a take out order it arrived like warm food was good but not for the price .
cute comfortable and warm great cheese and meat platter and great wine service was great too definitely going back soon .
horrible service and greasy food for good thai look elsewhere .
great atmosphere the menu is limited but great to go for tapas and wine fantastic wine menu and they always play great music perfect for a date at the bar or even a group .
dont know what all the hype is about dishes were hit or miss nothing amazing trendy fun atmosphere .
seated type of place no area for mingling standing up serves dinner in front great wines they accomodated no reservation birthday group until a reserved party arrived crowded on late oct sat night need to make reservations .
one word to describe the experience meh it wasnt bad and they are trying very hard to be higher end thai food but overall experience there are better and cheaper food elsewhere .
jadis has a great wine list and lovely food great for a date an evening out with old friends or a party in the back with their super comfy couches also the service is always great check out jadis you will not be disappointed .
over priced and overwhelming seasoning had papaya salad and it was too sour to enjoy had a soup that was too salty and a curry that was too sweet i left dinner feeling like i just binged at dylans candy bar .
best wine bar ever seriously though comfortable seating moderate prices cozy decor friendly service yummy food who could ask for more .
if you have a board outside saying happy hour beer 5 you should have 5 beer on the inside .
dude i love this place i bring friends here its awesome and such a good price and to be honest every time i call last minute for a large party they always cater to me i love it here .
the veggie chicken banh me was gross .
came here for a friends going away party great wine selection reasonable prices nice romantic and cozy spot .
their hours are a crapshoot when open the food is decent but more often than not im greeted by a closed sign .
nice wine bar atmosphere no pretense well priced cheese and wine selection def try the quiche .
um closed on a saturday at 4pm you failed as a deli and you were closed on a weekend when the mercer dragon boat festival was down the street super fail sorry and i so wanted to try your sandwiches boo .
hands down the best wine bar in the city the wines and food are superb and the service is impeccable for this vibe and caliber jadis could have gotten away with charging a lot more .
the food was good but only if you were to look at it eating it proved to be a daunting task mostly because of how badly it tasted the service was good though .
excellent wine warm atmosphere .
no no no do not go here it was just plain awful service good enough but clearly had some issues going in food was terrible hate to be so honest but wouldnt want anyone to go here thinking it was going to be good food .
attentive helpful staff a great wine list and generous charcuterie and fromage platters to satisfy most an ideal place to share a bottle .
how can this place have any good reviews i dont understand honestly some of the worst attempt at mexican food ive had in quite awhile my enchiladas were tasteless wet and expensive what a waste of a meal out .
tasty wine and even tastier cheese very attentive staff nice ambient music good times great for a night out for catching up with the girls .
not at all vegetarianfriendly soso food and over priced very disappointing .
all all around a great place to be great ambiance stellar quiche and pleasant staff cheese platter was perfect and the prices pretty good for a date girls night out if youre in the area or just want some wine oh yeah scallops do it .
this is not mexican food waaaay overpriced check out the many many other much better restaurants in burlington first .
cozy warm candles great wine great prices perfect date place .
certainly has refried beans with all the flavor of canned beans and melted orange cheese but authentic mexican or anything remotely resembling it this is not .
very friendly downtoearth yet special their french inspired sandwiches and salads are delicious and made with care the wine list is full of wines by the glass and the staff is very knowledgeable i really like this place can you tell im tired .
i dont know what was up with the place but the food was not fresh the service was non existent would not darken their doorstep again the waiter was nice once he found us not that it was busy .
perfect place to relax into the suppl leather couches and have a glass of wine with friends my friend lives upstairs and calls it his living room the food is also quite good and the owners and friendly .
ordered 2 burritos which came with maybe a tablespoon of meat between them all rice and beans definitely not ordering from this place again .
one of my favorite wine bars the wines are affordable great syrahs for 25 cozy exposed brick atmosphere friendly owner the cheese plates are mediocre but their duck mousse is quite good .
go for the warm homemade churros da best .
great little find on the lower east side that has somehow escaped the weekend onslaught that other places in the area contend with lowkey with nice ambiance good wine selection attentive service and a great cheese plate the salami small plate was great as well .
i ordered the shrimp scampi on the 10 95 special menu and to my surprise i was brought five shrimp in a small dish with two potato slices a for sure no go ridiculously over priced with awfully small portions .
went there for a quiet evening they have a great selection of french wines the small plates definitely hit the spot and the ambiance low lights brick and an overall chill atmosphere make this a great place to spend an evening with friends or lovers .
disgusting revolting just run away from this place it has french fries and grease on the floor its a grease fire waiting to happen the waitress was rude needless to say we didnt eat and left gross .
great food great delivery .
way overhyped streets are dangerous at night food portions are huge very very greasy was on the toilet for hours afterwards truly frightening location very hothumidgreasy inside i will not return .
great food wish i had someone to explain the ordering process because i felt so lost the lady wasnt very nice when i did order but its whatever id still go back there to eat lol .
food was bland and completely uninspired the real disappointment was the terrible customer service and rude wait staff no wonder the place was crowded .
best spanish food in bayonne great staff and they do deliver .
my husband and i went to sawatdee the service was great but i asked for not spicy at all and it was still way too spicy for me food was okay but ive had better good prices though .
its true what everyone says the food is delicious and its cheap too but the service is horrible they dont ask how can i help you or anything and when youre indecisive like myself they like grill you to order something now .
this is for takeout only as i did not dine in but too expensive and too small of a portion for takeout thai i will go back to try dining in .
good food excellent place warning the girls behind the food line can be a but ruff around the edge seemed a bit stuck up but for the most part excellent food and cheap .
bad service bland food and way too loud server messed up the order then lied about it to top it off we had to ask for check many times not coming back ever .
amazing food i never had a problem with the service but i also dont usually eat in i usually take out great great food and the prices are fair .
good place for parathas lovers but other food was average .
as a dominican living in bayonne i could not be happier to of found this place feels like being back in manhattan in the heights great food amazing portions and prices that cant be beat .
last time i ate here which was 1 year ago i saw a roach crawling up the wall eat here at your own risk .
delicious food fresh and affordable .
baraf ka gola they have signs for this delicious dessert but good luck ordering it if you plan on staying there for some ridiculous reason it is takeout only .
this place is fantastic for brunch such great service fantastic food and it all came quickly to us no wait even on a busy brunch sunday good stop in philly just a side notethere is only one bathroom in the back .
the only good thing about this place is the view and the only reason it gets a star so by all means have a drink here and enjoy the sunset but skip the dining there are so many good options in burlington this is not one of them .
love stopping here for a late breakfast during the week the omelets are amazing and huge fresh cup of coffee and service is always with a smile .
if you want to get some weak ass drinks with a shit ton of people around this place is for you .
yum get the cows burger its delicious and get their sweet patatoes fries and half iced tea lemonade delicious .
i was disappointed with how i was treated by the staff at milk honey the were rude when they took my order and unapologetic when they got it wrong .
love this place food is great the service is really good and the atmosphere is awesome i wish we have something like this in cali .
they allow no computers on weekends they need to improve on their customer service definitely not a place to go have a relaxing cup of coffee or study .
food was delicious we had their signature stuffed french toast be ready for a huge portion lol .
this place has good food and coffee but they get a bad review because the service is extremely slow it took 30 minutes for an egg sandwich i should have gone to ctown gotten my own ingredients and made it myself at home so ridiculous .
friends brought me here while visiting philly it was the most ridiculously good brunch i have ever had everything on the table was amazing .
the place is nice but the service sucks and the food is not very good to say needs more flavor .
food was delicious one of my top 5 places to have brunch i had the stuffed challah french toast will definitely eat here again .
rude staff with the exception of the woman still killed the vibe .
theres french toast was the best french toast ive ever had in my life they take card its byob including hard liquor .
we picked up two pies last week canned mushrooms yes canned mushrooms are you kidding me in 2013 in jersey they serve canned mushroom two stars is generous the other pie was cold never going back .
the best huevos rancheros that ive had in philly only bad part is waiting for a table when they get really busy .
i thought his place was ok then it started to go downhill there pizza wa pretty good yet lately its very bland and i only order it when i get a coupon otherwise i stick to sopranos or linwood .
iam never sick of their spanish latte their service is always good i go there everyday and even made friends with the workers there .
just got home from a disappointing dinner food was fine but many mistakes for an 80 each dinner including a bowl of sugar instead of salt with the bread room temperature rose and and a bus boy with mealruining bo .
great food great service every single time i have never been disappointed worth the wait you wont regret waiting stuffed french toast is amazing .
was disappointed love bobby flay but thought the food would be better the chicken tasted like soap and i couldnt even eat the potatoes on the side the appetizers are better than the entrees .
feels very homie and much like a diner feel to it great service and superb dishes like all of the philly sabrinas cafe their challah french is sooooo good but its a must share dish so filling .
just left the restaurant was served raw porc they took it back brought it back and it was still raw .
i recently made a second visit to this location and was not disappointed good service and great good i had the stuffed french toast again and tried the krusty burger both were excellent im looking forward to returning and trying something else on the menu .
in a word meh squid ink pasta was thin overlooked and salty desert not memorable maybe get a pastry chef waitress messed our order was an ok meal food was normal and not mind blowing not worth going back maybe i just was expecting more .
yummy personally i think the stuffed french toast is too much just the french toast is great .
asked for brown rice got white meals contain almost no veggies about 85 tofu which is overly sweet i wouldnt go back .
love their huevos rancheros the french toast looked amazing too service was quick and pleasant overall despite dealing with multiple waitresses i would recommend trying this place after visiting the sites of logan square location is parking friendly as well .
food was a 2 processed ham is pretty much the only ingredient in the peking noodles service was a 1 the owner was really mean .
amazing food really fast giving us our food good service nice people really good music as well definitely coming back .
not a fan i thought i liked it at first but later i changed my mind nothing special .
best breakfast place ive been to in pa the turkey bacon spinach fritatta is fantastic .
slow on the service and the bubble tea is seriously watery and lacking in foamy goodness the portions for lunch were decent just everything is over sauced to death if you order anything just request the bottle of sauce on the side .
we had a great time at brunch the french toast is a must for sure its byob and we brought alcohol but the orange juice added up fast really might as well be buying drinks the wait was quick and food came fast id definitely recommend it .
soup dumplings were just okay some had absolute no soup some had the reason why i gave them 1 star is because the waiters were absolutely obnoxious can not believe how rude they were would not comeback here again .
byob brunches are whack waiting 40 minutes for a table is whack being cramped into a booth is whack quick service inexpensive and oneofakind brunch items as well as ahituna burgers and beautiful patrons well lets just agree thats not whack .
if you want to try authentic chinese food please do not come here everything here is americanized i order spicy fish filet a big no no probably they do better at shanghai food but im not a big fan of one restaurant multiple cuisine at all .
fabulous stuffed french toast and home fries and peppers my server was friendly and helpful plus side they accept credit cards yay .
disgusting you can receive the worst service in ny ­ .
my husband and i went here when we first visited philly and we loved it its so old school and charming the food is great too .
soup dumplings were good but not worth the terrible service we received didnt ask if we needed water or anything they know the service sucks so they add a 15 tip to your bill regardless of your party size .
cant go wrong with breakfast all day good vegetarian and gluten free options came here for lunch but ordered from the breakfast menu they were accommodating of my friends gluten free needs we are there before going to the barnes which is a short walk away .
i think this will be my last visit to joes the skin of the soup dumplings are thinner and theres a lot of soup only plus do not try the pan fried noodles the noodles look and taste like styrofoam and the sauce makes it worse .
way better than any other diner i have been too the sausages i ordered were tasty and not with nasty skin that hangs off the homes fries were great overall satisfied i will be back next time im in the mood for american diner .
the food was great but i got a food poisoning later waiter was kinda rude he told us to leave right after we paid the bill because people were waiting but do i go back yes the food was that great .
great food and some oldfashion american service staff is very friendly even when its busy i had their signature stuffed french toast and its huge so bad for you but it was worth it .
my boss and i both got sick terrible atmosphere and service .
had an awesome breakfast here this morning as they say on the reviews the portions are big as a gluten free person the sourdough bread is the best i have found the staff is very friendly and efficient highly recommend .
for me customer service is really important in a restaurant waiterswaitresses can easily ruin your appetite to me the food was a bit better than other shanghai restaurants you go to in chinatown the waiterwaitresses do not respect customers .
i enjoyed the variety of flavors in the dishes here but the portions are way too big i liked the atmosphere and our server evan took care of us with charm and wisdom very pleasant dining experience food for parties of 26 .
many people recommend went couple years ago and got really disappointed more people recommend these years went again sigh will never go back not seen much chinese people eating there for decent shanghainese food please do not go there .
call ahead ignore those reviewers moaning and whining about the wait you can eeeeeeeasily avoid it by calling with your party number as you travel there dont be a dummy call ahead sabrinas is the best .
tourist trap dont go especially if you are vegetarian they preadded a service charge on our bill even with 2 people food was mediocre at best .
best breakfast place ive ever been to the food just blew my taste buds away and the prices arent too bad i hear the wait can get crazy on certain days but i havent experienced it yet .
this is a worst restaurant the food very very salty and the server so bad i never come here again .
love love love this place everything is amazing its worth the wait we split the stuffed french toast for dessert it was suggested by our amazing waitress .
joes shanghai is errr another below average restaurant 1star .
the food is amazing but plan extra time to wait we were told 45 minutes to an hour and waited about an hour and a half but the stuffed french toast is worth it .
the xlb were pretty good but overall its not something to be impressed about the chicken fried rice was okay but the flat noodles were greasy you can just taste the msg the service is bad too cash only .
great food awesome service affordable prices unbeatable sabrinas cafe is a hidden gem in philadelphia and i highly recommend anybody to venture to the chic cafe on callowhill street well worth the possible wait for an available table .
not authentic at all and the do not have dim sum as it said in yelp too salty and very american chinese first time yelp lets me down .
as good food atmosphere and staff as other reviewers described definitely a momas in san francisco kind of place .
everything including other food service and the environment besides the xiao long bao is horrible .
i have never had a meal here that wasnt perfect my go to place for brunch the best stuffed french toast .
not the best cleanoiness the only good thing on menu was king pao chicken over priced wouldnt return rude staff .
i think at this point lengthy reviews for this place are superfluous standard brunch place long wait esp groups huge portions brunch specials huevos rancheros are always solid prefer green eggs but something to be said for 50ft walk to brunch .
theres insect in the food and terrible handling services food taste great but just dirty as hell .
excellent for breakfast lunch or dinner great food attentive staff and reasonably priced stuffed french toast for breakfast is a must the turkey burger is also fantastic .
yes the soup dumplings are amazing but that is it the attention seems to be raising prices which makes it less attractive for a chinatown location sorry last time as a local visiting this tourist trap .
was great showed up saturday afternoon and only waited 10 minutes food was amazing and portions large great food at a great prince and excellent waitstaff .
waaaaay overrated poor service greasy food and always a crowd of people one of the dishes we ordered looked like it was reheated in the microwave i prefer asia manor on mott street .
fantastic brunch but be ready to wait .
overrated dumplings less clean and more crowded even on low chinatowncalibrated standards also on the lower tier of chinatown bathrooms the innards and surrounding area smelled bad granted it was summertime .
ive tried my first veg cheesestake here and i liked it .
we lined up for over 40 minutes to be served we ordered soup dumplings baby shrimp beef and vegetable it is fair to say only the taste of soup dumplings and vegetable could be accepted from a chinese point of view .
great la colombe coffee excellent service jonathan was attentive and helpful reasonable pricing decent food if youre here for the french toast not the stuffed one get the kids size because the regularportioned challah french toast is massive .
was greeted in the beginning by a nice young lady as soon as we hit the table the service was bad poor customer service and the food was mediocre for having so many celebrities here i was surprised .
had brunch here today with a large group of people the food and service were excellent i got an omelet but after seeing the stuffed french toast i wish i got that dish it looked so good next time id get that and would definitely come back here .
the hot and sour soup was excellent the rest soup dumplings pickled cabbage cold sesame noodles was way too oily too oily even for our 6 foot teenager who is a human food vacuum i love chinese but would have to say give this one a pass .
doesnt take reservations be prepared to wait that said sunday brunch is awesome you wont be disappointed .
overhyped rude staff soup dumplings quite ordinary i wish my friend who referred me had told me about the awkward community dining on circular tables unless you have an inside scoop or can talk to the staff dont bother it was a wasted meal experience .
i had breakfast here on a weekday 9am plenty of seats available very casual place since this was my first visit i went with one of sabrinas specialties stuffed french toast it was delicious will definitely stop by again the next time im in fairmount .
the soup dumplings are great but only the pork and everything else is subpar have been twice and thats once too much .
great food portions like ive never seen before i would have given 5 stars if it wasnt for the order being wrong would definitely come back check it out .
i dont get it the service was bad the food quality was horrendous the wait was long everyone said my dish was the best and i thought it was gross cant imagine how bad their food must have tasted the emperor has no clothes .
i found this place on yelp according to the high reviews we went with family and liked the friendly service and yummy food the food portion is actually a good size if youre a breaking bad fan they have a special menu section .
their soup dumplings are delicious and their food is good as well but the wait is just ridiculous i honestly dont think that it is worth the wait 40 minutes for dumplings no thank you .
great service nice atmosphere and delicious breakfast stumbled here by accident but will definitely make the 25 minute trip from nj for the stuffed french toast and huevos rancheros .
this place is definitely paying for fake reviews i get that its always packed with tourists but 2000 reviews and 4 stars for unspectacular shanghainese food you must be kidding me .
this is my second time here sabrinas has amazing brunch selections its byob and their specials are alway tasty and have interesting names its a bit crammed inside and the wait is usually between 45min1hr but its definitely worth it .
i got food poisoning and everything was super greasy pass .
great family atmosphere we took our 3 week old the portions are huge service is friendly and the food is delicious sweet potato fries and stuffed french toast are a must .
food was mediocre at best the restaurant is small and dingy they take tip from you and add it to the bill would not recommend this place at all .
sabrinas was awesome got the blue cheese and bacon frittata and the huevos rancheros very creative with flavors and large portions all of the wait staff dresses like a bunch of damn hipsters so be prepared but really nice people great service and phenomenal food .
i had the dumplings everyone goes crazy over they were tasty but otherwise this was just a busy chinese food place no dim sum which was what i was searching for .
great breakfast with huge portions prepare for a wait on the weekends unless youre there real early .
this was the worst chinese food i have ever eaten except for the soup dumplings .
great brunch spot come hungry food and service were excellent the stuffed french toast was out of this world the wait was about 20 minutes but we would have waited 120 for the kind of meal we got .
ok at best the soup dumplings were good but everything else was just meh atmosphere is like a cross between a diner and a chinese restaurant dont plan on a return visit that i do know .
really interesting brunch menu tried rosalitas dios mio with black bean grits however the challah french toast with cream cheese and bananas absolutely stole the show will be back .
average quality food no lunch menu visible 14 for lemon chicken and white steamed rice not a one price by any means more like try other places instead that are nicer inside .
we went on a saturday morning and didnt have to wait at all because we sat at the bar the heuovos rancheros were really good and the staff was very friendly i would definitely go back .
my review in one sentence shanghai cafe makes a better soupy dumpling in the words of forrest gump and thats all i have to say about that .
once a year i always have a lunch date here with a friend of mine service is always good foods good love their specials parking wise its as sucky as center city thats the downside .
we really wanted to try this went all the way down only to find it has a c rating to get a b is hard to do so to have a c it must be filthy what a huge disappointment after coming all that way diners beware .
amazing menu unique and creative huevos rancheros was delicious .
dont know why everyone loves the dumplings thought they were gross shanghai noodles were good but nothing special .
usually tasty fare off the specials menu for a decent price you can even share a plate and still be full beware the wait try going on off times or just grab a seat at the bar instead of a table shorter wait time .
was very disappointed when visited they use to have the best dumpling in town but i guess no more it was nasty when i ordered it last time .
this place is always good consistent the huevos rancheros are a must try the wait tends to be pretty long about 30 minutes but if you call ahead its take some time off .
ive had better go to shanghai cafe for cheaper dont get what all the noise is about .
seriously the best brunch in philly ive never had a bad dish in this location or university city location the specials are always innovative creative and most importantly delicious .
too busy overly crowded ive had better chinese food and soup dumplings its overrated for what you actually get .
mmm .
i got nightmare food poisoning after eating here nuff said the food was also terrible too terrible to even write about .
delicious i recommend the stuffed french toast the portions are huge you could easily split the meal between two .
i love soup dumplings and joes got some decent dumplings but to wait for a table and to deal with the staffs that thinks their better than their job ill pass so many places in chinatown to get decent dumplings ill have to pass .
good breakfast if you are hungry portions are big .
errrrr as someone having xiao long bao for over 20 yrs i have to say this place makes something i would never consider as xiao long its sooo big and the cover is just too thick cant understand y so many ppl praised it .
terrific everyone knows sabrinas is classic fun and delicious great food accommodating great service good for groups despite the always full crowd comfortable .
i like the food but the service merits a 2 star i simply hate waiting on a line when the staff shows no urgency to get me seated its also just too crowded to sit definitely consider taking out instead .
great french toast worth the 10 checken sandwhich was good roll was hard not sure if maybe it was suppose to be burger came back super bloody so ask for super well done unless youre a vampire .
food poisoning enough said .
diner with awesome food as noted in other reviews great for vegetarians quality seitan that can be subbed for lots of choices with meat great service staff as well .
for what it costs the food is great however ive had better chinese food and steamed pork dumplings elsewhere if youve had the dumplings at din tai fung in southern california then joes shangai doesnt even compare .
great place for brunch service is awesome and they are super nice and helpful did not give 5 stars just because i never give 5 but they kind of deserve 5 for the food and the staff o .
on the night of december 2nd joes shanghai got 105 violation points from the health department and i got food poisoning its too bad because the food tasted great .
ive always eaten the french toast which has never been a let down i finally decided to get the pancakes the best buttermilk pancakes ive ever had they are so fluffy and with the cinnamon sugar on top its nothing but amazing .
food was horrible soup dumping were gross lion head was 4 meatballs for 14 just horrible not worth a dollar i know good food and it is not here .
the nachos were fantastic a little on the expensive side and the restaurant is often crowded but that just proves how popular it is .
i love the xiao long bao here but the service really kills my mood the servers are extremely rude at times the joes shanghai in flushing is much better the food tastes the same and the atmosphere is more relaxed compared to the one in chinatown .
best french toast in existence so worth the wait and the staff is awesome also love the personal touch with the homey coffee mugs .
i felt kinda nasty after leaving and found the soup dumplings here to be a little on the gelatinous side they were ok but im not going back since the wait is out of hand .
one of phillys best restaurants you get a good amount of food staff are terrific and its worth the wait i been here about 10 times and was never dissapointed once u go u will be hooked .
i ate dinner at joes shanghai crabpork soup dumplings vegetable lo mein and pepper shrimp last night and by 4 a m was sick as a dog with food poisoning beware .
generous portions and yummy food the decor is super cute and eclectic and because the menu changes all the time there is always something new and interesting on the menu one of my favorite places for brunch in the city .
long wait to sit but fast food service dumplings are not that good especially compared to din tai fung .
great food and the menu changes all the time so theres always something new to try ive had the eggs benedict and tried several of the mexican inspired brunch foods and never been disappointed the portions are huge definitely splittable byob .
pros quick takeout scallion pancakes cons greasy made too far in advanced tasting food canned mushrooms and imitation crab requested vegetable spring rolls actual rolls had pork and shrimp cash only run down tired space tossed the leftovers sad i wasted one of my precious ny meals here .
excellent food i had the fall pasta special my wife had a burger both were delicious and huge in spite of that we saved room for dessert the flourless chocolate tort was seriously chocolaty and my red velvet cake was yummy .
too greasy and too salty the dumplings joes is known for are way over hyped save yourself the wait and trek and just hop into any other chinatown eatery for better treats .
freakin amazing food they come up with the most random concoctions that sounds strange but is utterly amazing its always crowded but theres a good reason for it the place is a little cramped but it doesnt matter when youre eating the food there .
i think its a lil overrated i like the other local joints and their xiao long bao not big about sharing tables .
this was recommended for breakfast by the concierge at the sheraton it was a good choice small place with a nice breakfast menu quick service good food even fresh baked bread definitely worth the walk for breakfast .
been there so many times dumplings are good but never know they put service charge even two people and not telling you aware of that we tipped every single time until we noticed last time .
my go to brunch place just be ready to wait for your seat .
i just noticed tonight that they put 15 service charge on the bill add that with your bill then tax you on that subtotal amount why are you charging me tax on the service charge ridiculous .
great way to start a date with my wife french toast was so big and filling great prices and very friendly service walking distance to many attractions really enjoyed it .
vomit inducing .
my favorite place ever id have them cater my wedding if possible .
sucks like eating mush .
great place to eat the wait is sometimes long but usually they get you seated pretty fast .
ive definitely had better soup dumplings we had the crab and the pork dumplings im not sure why the soup in the dumpling was so brown its not supposed to be that brown people i gave them an extra star because the service was good .
the best things about this place are the atmosphere and the huge menu lots of vegfriendly options in a trendy hip eclectic place ive only been there for breakfast twice but one day id like to go back for lunch or dinner this place is way fun .
this place has gone downhill now that it is a tourist destination the dumplings are still good but nothing else is joes shanghai in flushing is much better .
made a quick trip to philly great food and great atmosphere .
tried this several times and it doesnt taste authentic the soup dumplings are soso and the dishes are missing the right flavors go to goodys they have a smaller location but they still have the best soup dumplings .
stuffed french toast insane barking chihuahua very yummy .
1 long wait at least 40 minutes on a good day 2 overwhelmingly crowded even at 10 pm 3 subpar dumplings and noodles go somewhere else .
what a great little find in downtown philly just a few blocks off of broad street be sure and check the board for their specials generous portions good food and great service .
i have been sick from there food for 12 days and had to take antibiotics from such bad bacteria from eating this disgusting shit do not eat here .
go go go so good so cheap for the quality and the amount of food their variety and creativity for breakfast dishes makes me choose this place every time very hipster btw .
joes is loud overcrowded with tourists and the food is subpar in my opinion there are far better places like new green bo to get famous soup dumplings joes yawn eye roll .
there normally is a wait to be seated every weekend but its well worth the wait brunch is amazing especially the stuffed french toast staff is great and food is well executed in a timely fashion .
go there for the steamed mini soup buns but stay for nothing else for true edible shanghai fare there are a couple other places in chinatown i would recommend over this place .
service was good nice atmosphere i had french toast stuffed with cream cheese that was awsome i would definetly go again .
poor service rude staff long wait for table even with reservations etc if you are big on service this is not the place for you too trendy with not enough focus on service and food food was decent but nothing special .
very cute place for brunch had the special stuffed challah french toast here which was delicious tofu scramble was also yummy the place is busy and a little cramped service was great impressively attentive given how busy they were 4 5 stars .
nothing appealed to me here everything we had on our table didnt taste right it was either too spicy or flavorless wouldnt recommend this restaurantive had much better asian fusion in the city staff was nice and the restaurant itself it nice looking but thats about it .
be prepared to get rolled out of this place at the end of your meal so delicious and so much food i always bring out of town visitors here but theres usually a pretty long wait at this location .
dumpling soup was too salty and they certainly dont know how to cook peking duck it is better be called fatty bbq duck .
this place rocks the stuffed french toast is phenomenal the meatloaf sandwich was tasty and the stafff makes the place water full check check on you but not too much check leave there with a smile everytime .
very disappointed by the fact that we made a reservation on open table for a specific time and still had to wait an hour after our reserved time to be seated .
salad and stuffed french toast .
as a chinese i just want to say that this place is not chinese food at all everything is salty like hell and it is reallllly expensive for just a few dishes if you like authentic chinese food dont go .
this is the place for breakfast big healthy menu and although the food can be a little inconsistent the waitstaff more than makes up for it with their prompt attention witty repartee and unique style perfect place to stop before work for coffee and a pancake .
h .
awesome breakfast place sometimes there is a long wait 1 hr very good food .
poor service was blatantly lied too while here i wouldnt trust them food is ehhh for the price too loud to enjoy the meal as well .
omg the portions were waaaayyyy too big i mean the 4 of us could have shared 1 entree my french toast was actually cold so they reheated it all in all it was good but portion is too much and this is coming from an extreme foodie .
meh thats the only word i can use to describe this place the dining room is great thats were the pros stop nothing stands out as being particularly bad as such just that this place is all about unmemorable mockasian food .
love to go for breakfast brunch or lunch large portions and good price i dont order the burgers since they char them they just taste burnt to me otherwise i love all the other entrees that ive ordered especially the sweet potatoe fries .
i went for dinner last night with my hubby everything we ordered was no good the philly cheesesteak tasted like fish and the fried rice was no good either the atmosphere was nice but everything else was just ok .
great breakfastbrunch spot came on saturday and it was packed luckily you can get a spot at the counter to bypass the line plus its walking distance to the franklin inst and the art museum .
if you are looking to develop cankles as a result of water retention then come here to increase your salt intake pack a camelback of water though because the servers arent the best at refilling your glass and the gobi is quite a trek to make without reserves .
i honestly like the other location better in terms of ambiance yelp combizsabrinasca… however the food here is just as good and there is less waiting .
stopped in for dinner but just got appetizers modern trendy and oh so center city nice sampling of local microbrews on tap edamame dumplings and cheesesteak small plates were good .
the food was great so yummy large portions call ahead and the wait is not too long very friendly and fast service nothing bad to say at all love it will go there lots of times .
went to sampan tonight for a drink after dinner at el vez and the place was dead the bartender in the back was terrible very weird vibe from this place wouldnt venture back even if the bevs were free two thumbs down way down .
wow simply awesome went one sunday morning and had to wait 1 12 hours for a table but well worth the wait stuffed french toast was great just call ahead to put your name on the waiting list .
not great food was too salty i wont come back nice set up and ambiance .
really good food for a very small cost .
not good wings are small and full of old oil dont bother the prices are all blocked out not the cleanest looking place wings express in west haven is way better .
awesome decaf crazy delicious stuffed french toast waitress was bubbly and kind reminded me how much i missed the show blossom .
i have had wings everywhere possible in ct and this place was the worst it was completely dirty and the wings were really tiny and really greasy hate to say it but i would never ever step foot in this nasty place again .
i tried this place out on recommendation from a friend its awesome i took my 2 kids a relative visiting us and my husband there was something for everyone everything was great outstanding service food is fresh loved it .
super bowl disaster even if you order a week ahead of time .
great brunch im a fan of this place .
i been to this place several times i do like their veggie sandwiches but today i ordered their chicken shawarma and it looked like dog food i would not be surprise it was really dog food because the owner also owns a pet hotel in soho .
this is the best brunch place in the city try the stuffed french toast period the huevos rancheros is also really good and so is the southwest chicken salad the service is helpful and attentive and we usually get sat pretty quickly even though theyre super busy .
definitely dont come here if your hungry ordered a smothered burrito and was like a large appetizer half the size of a chipotle burrito very disappointed .
amazing brunch worth the wait cal ahead for reservations stuffed french toast was amazing juevos rancheros next time the table next to us ordered thise and they look yummy .
went to qdoba for the first time and i dont think ill go back any time soon quantity isnt quality .
great service great presentation of food .
i agree with previous reviewers that the place is way overairconditioned i will add that i am 80 certain that the burrito i had at qdoba is responsible for giving me food poisoning im never going there again despite its cheapness and convenience .
one of the best brunch places in philly im a fan bc it is consistently good and the service is awesome .
terrible service our orders were sent to the next table waiter kept on asking if we have everything when there were dishes missing food is sub par considering the price overall wife was pissed not coming back .
always a wait but well worth it .
tempura was just ok the one piece of baby yellowtail i had seemed fresh tom yum soup tastes like dirty water dumped into a used pot prices are expensive for such bad food the presentation is nice but im never coming back here .
sabrinas cafe was great the stuffed challah french toast was amazing there are actually two types of french toast one has berries and the other has bananas both are amazing .
we went bc its close to angelika reviews looked good we got the balsamic liver thing and the lasagna and some beef dish it was edible but i never want to have any of it again .
great service and awesome food well worth the 30 minute wait on a weekend .
its a nice cozy atmosphere but a bit on the stuffy side their ravioli is a never order it is just 4 huge squares of dough sitting in unsalted butter i believe their only decent dish is the lasagna and seafood pasta from their pasta entrees .
so good that we had to make 2 visits in a 24hr period before we said goodbye to philly huge portions mouthwatering food and great prices this is definitely the best cafe i have ever been to .
i just dont get it the food has been terrible every single time ive been there youre sat on top of strangers and you must wait forever to get in overall though im glad its there so people go to von the end .
we met with some friends for breakfast and had a mix of stuffed french toast eggs benedict and some other items all of our food was top notch but the stuffed french toast stood out as the best item ordered .
they told us at 10pm 30 minutes before closing that they are closed please change the hours so no one else rushes there to find out they are late .
this place gets better every time i go food is awesome breakfast all day had to take off one star due to the fact that i heard two staff members cracking jokes on someone eating boooo keep this in check management .
great price poor food had three dishes salty salty salty and this oily fried wonton garbage with slice pork cuts tiramisu with tons of dark chocolate used to kill the rest of the cake .
wonderful breakfast eggs were over cooked but overall very good .
almost an hour wait to get our food on a sunday afternoon how hard is to cook sausages being nice complaining and asking politely why doesnt help get your food any faster fail wont come back here .
sometimes great sometimes not sometimes no wait sometimes wait forever sometimes super friendly sometimes not so much .
no star bartenderwaiter rudely shrugged his shoulders upon me asking where to sit i walked out and wont return why eatdrink in a place with a rude staff .
pretty fantastic brunch .
really did not like this place it was entirely too crowded and the air conditioning was not working properly it was actually nicer outside in the august heat they do have a good selection of german beer but i dont think i saw much of anything else .
great place for brunch plan to wait 30min 1 hour great prices for the large portions .
terrible service took 15 minutes to get water it was almost 40 minutes to get my food other people who sat down after me received their food ahead of me when my food came out it wasnt very warm and my side of fruit was puny .
the wait is worth it .
really bland food and the portions seemed smaller than average very disappointed would not do again .
if youre looking for a good place for breakfast sabrinas should be at the top of your list the huevos rancheros and pancakes were excellent although there were a lot of people waiting they never pressured us to leave .
worst mexican food ever and i am mexican and from los angeles food wad bland and terrible and worst service ever as a latino i know things might run slower than normal but this was awful service and i could wait to pay and leave .
good things come to those who wait the stuffed french toast is as advertisedamazing food portions are big the waitresses are fun and serve you well they refill your coffee before you ask price is good too for philly highly recmd this place .
this place is the worst we waited hours for a table then 45 minutes for drinks then they got our oders wrong then they charged us for food and drink we never received when we complained the staff assaulted my friend avoid at all costs .
great breakfast large portions decent burgers just found out about this little jewel after living 1 block away for 6 months only complaint is that it is very popular and youll have to wait about 1520 mins for sunday brunch .
ordered the steak faijita it was anything but fresh the meat tasted sour only got through one bite before i had to spit it out only good thing were the margaritas the food he is just awful which is a shame but typical of south orange .
this place gets pretty packed but well worth the wait stuffed french toast gives sabrinas some welldeserved bragging rights .
the ambiance was nice but the food quality was not the best asked for a skirt steak medium and they made it well done the guacamole was delicious and the service was good might give it another try but ive had better texmex food in other locations .
breakfastbrunch is priddy much my favorite meal and sabrinas has good eats though the wait can be a pain sometimes .
ive lived in la for 14 years and even the chain places there are far better than this place this place reeks of frozen food been there once wont go back .
loved it awesome in size and quality french toast order half long wait after 10a bustling diner atmosphere friendly and hip my only complaint too much food next time well order one thing and split it .
came here and the sangria was good but i asked for pulpo octopus and they gave me squid major let down but what was even worse was it was over cooked and the service is not that great .
got a delicious veggie burger next time ill be more adventurous quick to be seated during the workweek for lunch which i hear isnt the case on the weekend the sweet potato fries were delicious the service was friendly and prompt couldnt ask for more .
i dont know what happened to toro it used to be an average restaurant since our last order my friends and i have vowed to never go back .
delicious gutbomb of a brunch option they have something on the menu to feed every hungry lumberjack in your group which is good since youll certainly work up an appetite waiting for your table .
bad takeout experence on early sunday evening pickup only bland and fatty no good .
probably one of the best places to have breakfast anywhere stuffed french toast with whipped cream cheese inside and fresh fruits with fruity syrup is just heavenly my favorite though is the omelet apple slices sauteed spinach roasted peppers and cheddar cheese yum .
the music hear was unbearable on their cheap stereo system the good was mediocre and didnt taste high quality i got the cachapa which looked and tasted like it came from a mix .
indulging in their banana and cream cheese stuffed french toast is my favorite brunch activity lovelovelove this place so cheap for so much food i recommend getting the half order of the french toast its not on the menu but theyve always happily obliged when i ask .
1207pm on a sunday phone hello cocotero me do you deliver phone yes but im busy so not now me well when phone when im not in the middle of something me okay click wtf wtf .
amazing brunch servings are definitely way bigger than necessary which makes for good leftovers .
service good food and drink no good .
food was amazing i felt compelled to finish everything on my plate as to not endure any potential bad karma from wasting such wonderful food also i called ahead and was seated within 10 minutes of arriving during a busy brunch sunday i would recommend the same .
this restaurant completely disappoints me every time i try to order their service is extremely poor .
yummy yummy brunch the only downside is that its impossible to decide what to order .
after all the great reviews we were overall disappointed the food was good but nothing spectacular .
youve cheered me up on those bad school days thanks sabrinas .
good and tasty food but the service is a whole different story not very organized at the time of keeping track of people waiting for tables we waited forever for a table for two and they kept skipping us as they didnt have a waiting list .
the special burger of the day was bleu cheese pears caramelized onions and bacon though it was cooked well past medium the burger was delicious and juicy .
bad service mediocre food passable .
tasty for sure had the challah french toast delicious apple and cheddar omelet was also a pick to be had very friendly staff and good eats check it out for the neighborhood breakfast .
we saw this restaurant on cooking channel yesterday so we decided to try we ordered appetizer sampler and patacones they were alright nothing to be impressed service was good and food was very reasonably priced although it wasnt expensive id rather spend the money for something else .
smashing just as good as the 1st but youll get seated faster soooo good try the juevos or the stuffed french toast bring your lover here then when she really falls in love with you and wants you to meet her parents bring them here .
we met some friends for some oysters and sliders at happy hour but were asked to leave because we had a baby with us it was 4 in the afternoon horrible customer service never going back .
this is place is no joke the bisen was super yummy definitely better than steak or maybe its the way the animal was raised i dont know but i would say this place you must try this place out i wish i had one closer to home .
pros cheap happy hour okay cocktails cons tacos average asked for corn tortillas and was brought flour anyway when i asked again i was ignored burger was small and overcooked raw bar was skimpier than max fish .
been there 3 times all meat served in beef or bison your choice i love the burgers one day ill try a steak but the bison burgers are so darn good perfect atmosphere for downtown eating and the bar is a cool spot to hang too .
service at the bar is consistently terrible .
great atmosphere bison is lower fat so i was worried that the filet would be dry asked the waitress about it and she assured me it was not dry yup its dry try the kansas city cut instead i would come back again .
service was good drinks were good food not so much this was based on brunch i would not recommend it for brunch .
wow easy to find cheap parking amazing food wonderful service fancy but not too fancy burgers are incredible the bison meat it was my first time trying it was very tasty julie was very attentive manager came by and made sure everything was good highly recommended .
both my codiner and i had the chicken shwarma very dry to remedy i doused it in hot sauce which was essentially franks watered down still not good my coeater also ordered fries there were like 10 on the plate .
good food decent prices had a group of about 12 people show up unannounced and they took care of us without a problem had a bison ribeye which was pretty tasty .
actually for the small sizes this place is expensive and presentation of the dish was not good at all quite disappointing will not go back .
we eat at teds whenever we can you cant say enough good things about teds everything is made from scratch and the beer selection is great .
just eh really .
my go to spot for soup to go at lunch as i work directly nearby friendly staff great quality of soups nice decor having had teds before a few times for dinner i can confirm most entrées are top notch .
bad bad bad i live 10 mins away the food was cold i ask for no salt on my fries n the put salt away the bread was hard wtf never ordering from them again .
we had a business meeting at lunch wednesday staff and management help facilitate us doing 2 different interviews all while serving excellent food the bison pot roast is tender and flavorful i will definitely be back .
save your money place was horrible noisy as well slow service with an attitude the waitress must have called my friend and i honey 6 times horrible place and people doesnt get much worse than this .
just had the best bison steak with broccoli asparagus and baked sweet potato sides the service was excellent this might be my new favorite restaurant .
it had shut down for about 6 months and is not the same i miss those breadsticks .
great pizza great prices and great people wonderful pizza combinations and now with the gluten free pizza options it is perfect for the whole family mmm .
my order came way after a lot of people who came after me the food was not tasty at all where are all the high reviews from disappointed .
a childhood favorite love the pizza huge slices best pasta around just in general great food and great service .
lifelong nyer these dumplings are horrible thick and soggy dumpling with tasteless fillings thats why theyre 2 00 leave this for the hipsters and the tourists really gross .
cant say i had much else besides the pizza but its delicious huge slices absolutely love the pepperoni .
theres no way it can compare to prosperity dumpling on the other end of the street no taste at all .
awesome food great price the penne chicken vodka rocks along with the chicken wings yummy .
i work in the area for that last 9 years their sesame pancakes are the best the services here suck they are very rude sad .
gotta love the extra large slices they have you can also buy the 22 jumbo pie its a great deal the only thing is that my husband is embarrsed when he picks up the jumbo pie since the box is extra large he feels like a gavone lol .
hold on to your receipt cause if you dont have it they will hold your food hostage mediocre dumplings and noodle soup but cheap you get what you pay for the redeeming thing is that the sesame pancake is amazing otherwise dont waste your time on this place .
went for lunch today and got the lunch special 6 50 for salad bread entree and a drink is a great deal its even valid on saturday we have also had the brick oven pizza also good the pizza slices of regular pizza are the biggest around .
now they have four dumplings for 1 25 how is this goin on they are clearly ripping people off .
what else can i say great food always and great service .
2 stars for being cheap otherwise better off anywhere else in the city .
the best steak sandwich i have had in a long time .
slow and uncaring staff i ordered dumplings and at took 15 minutes go down the street someplace more authentic .
what an amazing place i have to say from the moment i walked through the door i was treated like a king the service was phenomenal and the food was amazig very great place to eat if youre looking for mom and pop food .
it is cheap but food rating were poor it is not my cup of tea sorry .
best customer experience hands down calamari was yum the picidaio plate was out of this world salad was delicious with just the right amount of dressing fried banana was scrumptious will be back again when i return to newark for business .
i dont understand the hype ive had much much better dumplings i guess if you dont want to make the hike to chinatown you could settle for vanessas but vanessas got nothing on prosperity .
delivery is fast food is great staff is friendly and portions are plentiful i really cant say anything bad about this spot .
noodles lack flavor dumplings are ok cheap food but youre getting what you pay for service is also rather rude not much seating available in the establishment .
the service was excellent very friendly charming small atmosphere and the food was well prepared very tasty additionally the price was quite reasonable .
you get what you pay for the dumpling skin is too thick little flavor and they dont seem interested in serving you if you dont speak the language .
everything tastes like something your grandmother might make if your grandma was an old portuguese lady amazing all around the staff is passionate about their food and they are happy talk you through every dish byob with a liquor store across the street schwing .
very very cheap dumplings but it was dry the filling was paltry and the dumplings were stuck to each other this is a good place is youre truly hungry an dont mind paltry dumplings but i wouldnt go back here unless i really needed to .
this is the best portuguese cuisine i have ever had be ready you leave as family the food is perfectly crafted perfect for a family or a date authentic beyond belief .
yeah so its cheap and thats why you sacrifice in quality and taste the dumplings mediocre and the sesame whatever also eh .
great place great place and very nice owners just ask what they are serving that day and you will not regret it .
1 so flavorless am i seriously the only person who thinks this 2 dumplings all taste the same whether you get this or that 3 the skin is hella doughy and thick 4 go to prosperity dumpling .
this place is adorable it has great great fish amazing platanos and the owner served us and was incredibely friendly i highly recommend this place cozy authentic and delicious .
worst dumplings ever .
it is an amazing restaurant the food is delicious and i also recommend everybody to go there .
the only thing good about this place is that its cheap dumplings have the thickest skin with flavorless unidentifiable stuff inside vegetables are bland and duck pancake sandwich wasnt filled with duck but rather duck fat plus its crowded and the people who work there are totally rude .
another great meal at sabor unido ive been all around newark for brazilianportuguese food and this place is the best ive ever had .
rating scale from lower score a to higher score aaaaa food taste na must not eat in here interior design a clearing a service aa price tasted on feb 11 2012 .
the best roasted veal that i ever had and im greek but the food is as good as the gr greek cuisine try it and you will understand .
this place is disgusting i saw roaches in the kitchen right before i was about to order i walked out .
grilled squid is great great reasonably priced portuguese and brazilian food very friendly nice waitress the menu has a mixture of portuguese and brazilian items .
wow 4stars this place is horrendous skin is way too thick walk over to prosperity and see what a real dumpling should taste like .
this the best restaurant ive visited in newark the ironbound the quality of the food is excellent affordable and with a very good selection of brazilian and portuguese flavors the service is very friendly they welcome you and makes you feel like home i highly recommend this place .
cheap but not delicious not terrible just not flavorful come here if youre in the neighborhood starving low on cash and just want to feel full .
this guys are the best every single aspect great food for the very nice people attending great delivery service there are simply awesome .
pork sandwiches is recommended price saved me from giving it a 1 star it was way to greasy for me i had to drench it in sascha sauce which totally killed the actual flavor .
this place never disappoints delicious homemade food at a reasonable price much cheaper than surrounding restaurants better quality than many places in the ironbound delivery is very quick too but i only live a few blocks away the service is also excellent highly recommended .
the cashier was rude and unfriendly my sesamy pancake was dry and fatty place is dingy and hardly has enough seats dumpling are ok but i prefer prosperity d .
the best thai in the hood i ordered drunk man noodle last night was spectacular and spicy also vegetable puff was so yum delivery was so fast as you would think all in all this is the best thai place is ues cant wait to order again .
had the pancake it was okay one more star but thats it .
good food with large portions every time lunch is around 9 which is solid for the area barely a counter and overall cramped space but quick service never waited more than 510 minutes for lunch and really nice people .
i was very disappointed by this place the dumplings were just ordinary and even though they said that they close at 11 they were trying to get us to leave by 1015 .
great lunch special ordered online for a large group at work prompt delivery they got the order correct for a large group and the food was delicious will definitely be ordering again .
nice ambience and super friendly staff the food didnt have the kick or spice were used to but overall presentation and service was great lina was awesome .
super fast super tasty and super consistant im so glad we found this place for delivery the noodles are great and the sauces really flavorful my favorite dish is the drunken noodles but i have yet to be disappointed .
if you want mexican food go to south philly if you want overpriced hipster tacos with some nice decorations go here they were quite tolerant of the large group i was with though .
i found this place around 8 months ago and i love the value i always get the same thing and i always get the take out get the peanut curry lunch special with spring rolls it is really tasty and only cost a little bit more than 8 .
i dont get it i mean reading these reviews makes me feel like tom hanks adult character in big when all the adult toy makers are in awe of an overly simplistic unimaginative skyscraper that can transform into a robot i dont get excellent service .
i order delivery only love the crispy sesame tofu and chicken with peanut curry sauce plus they have a yummy oreo cake for dessert only problem is that they close on the early side 1000 on saturdays .
very disappointed what more can i say cheap sugary low class drinks tried atleast 4 but does have great fish tacos .
wellpriced good portions tasty tofu the pad se ew was quite tasty ordered seamless delivery was prompt .
food is very good but service is so rushed that it is impossible to enjoy it no time between courses very noisy and not a good place for conversation intrusive waitstaff i will not be returning .
a perfect place for pick up orders i had chicken pad thai and it was delicious i would definitely visit there next time .
this place was average at best and the price was a lot more than it was worth overall i would meet a friend there for a drink or something but im not chomping at the bit to go back .
we had grilled pork chops beef fried rice with a lot of beef shrimp fritters and thai spare ribs all of the dishes was great i be trying some other dishes soon a nice addition to the neighborhood something different .
not for vegetarians their veggie burger a black bean burger tasted like a meat patty with black beans under it i havent eaten meat in 5 years and the taste of the patty still makes me nauseous .
atmosphere was definitely american retro and the food was amazing i had the chicken sandwich with tater tots awesome four of us had lunch and a drink for 60 waitress was great as well next time we go to the daily show this is a definite stop .
seriously i want my money back the pizza we were served was warm taste like soggy flat bread with warm cheese and ingredients tables were on top of each other felt rush honestyly i had better 99 cents pizza .
there will be a line but its worth it always fresh and amazingly tasty get your preferred variety of shack burger and crinklecut fries also try the amazing concretes the local variety constellation i think is fantastic as is the american retro thats available one day a week .
greasy flavorless pizza it is food though go to frannys if you want to get good neapolitan style pizza .
the pizza and chili cheese tots are life the retro burger is also quite amazing only issue is this place is really far from everything else .
pretty soggy pizza so so not bad but then when is pizza .
good place to stop for a totally affordable meal before a show at terminal 5 great tots seriously eat the tater tots .
really good pizza and fresh ingredients and pairings but waaaaayyy took over priced for the size which is an 11 inch pie we measured it .
awesome junkcomfort food at great prices the burger with the chipotle mayo is delicious great place to order from if you want some comfort food or are having some people over and dont want to cook wings and such yourself delivery is usually very quick as well .
cashier doesnt speak english unless youre portuguese expect 2nd class treatment from waiters especially the guys most waitresses have good customer service though food is great but service not so much .
love this place love the food love the atmosphere the bartender is always a gracious host and sometimes even gives us stuff on the house we always frequent this place for birthday events and it always turns out great its definitely a trek but worth it .
y say open 247 n u r really closed im searching and hungry finding nothing .
good spot good prices great service .
overrated the bun is twice the size of the burger patty which was slightly dry and overcooked took over 25 mins to get order for takeout definitely not worth the price .
nice somewhat divey bar with some good solid beers on tap loads of character not one of those nyc places that tried to buy their way into coolness .
some of the worse bbq ever had pulled pork was so dry and tough like eating a shoe will not be back .
the retro burger is yum the booze is good and you get buy backs .
terrible microwaved ribs and chicken pictures of fire everywhere but the food had never seen a flame boooooo .
its in my neighborhood practically across the street good beer fun bartendersowners great food tvs for your sportviewing pleasure what more could a girl ask for .
the chickens not bad but the service sucks a large mash potatoes is only 34 full they dont take amex they talk about you in spanish if they bungled your order in front of you btw and lets you wait for the wings without telling you .
very cool place good food n drinks tots were awesome .
rotten child of the vetri family .
buffalo tater tots holy crap awesome .
after reading all the lovely reviews i booked a reservation here while i was visiting philly for the wknd i was not impressed food was standard unimaginative italian fare service was judgmental and far too snooty for the kind of place this is billed for .
if you like tater tots that much then you must go here they make tots any which way here including disco tots .
rude condescending waitress worst service ever tiny portions and no tap water is that even legal .
im blatantly giving this hells kitchen mediocre sports bar 5 stars for one reason only they have taylor ham sliders anyone from new jersey will understand .
loooove the artichoke i wish i could bath in that sauce unfortunately the rest of our meal was pretty blah but those artichoke .
nice regular bar with good service and atmosphere not pretentious not touristy not hipster not what i was expecting midtown the retro burger on english muffin had a nice juicy hunk of meat and was excellent open to 4am .
meh is right i was excited for this place because of the great reviews but it did not impress me they only had 1 or 2 dishes under 20 and they were tiny and not a real meal way too expensive for not enough food .
grab a drink before the daily show or colbert report or really any time nice bar tenders good food strong drinks could you ask for more .
bistro total letdown ordered medium rare burger and steak came completely raw while the girl on the phone was totally pleasant she offered no sort of compensation for our 86 00 delivery meal .
solid food good service nice addition to hells kitchen .
i was looking forward to trying this place but left disappointed mushroom app was too salty while the fish of the day bland and full of bones .
tater tots happy hour waiting for the daily show awesome would never go out of my way to get there but was very pleasantly surprised amazing tater tots with chipotle mayo for serious .
gave them a chance again recently regret it this place has the potential to be good if they dont mess up orders dont deliver a sandwich that is squished and flattened i get the impression that they dont pride themselves in their food .
if you are heading to a show at terminal 5 this is place is a no brainer before and after the show happy hour until 7 pm and after the show cheap drinks and kitchen open until 2 am .
the pizza was good but the panini was awful its made on pizza dough which would be fine but the dough has obviously been frozen and was even stale and at least press it like a panini too many good places around to settle here go elsewhere .
awesome love this places pork chops everyone should ask for vinny boombatz give him a kiss for me .
why can i order online from champs junior on grubhub and not the real deal champs it is 2013 lets experience online ordering together champs .
the service is excellent as always very customer service friendly .
lots of attractive people wait an hour or more to eat brunch here but i dont know why the food is pretty bad they get you in and out quickly at least .
nice bar a bit on the divey side but fun really good food at decent prices staff are very friendly and on top of the tables they work free refills on soda always a pluss .
i wish i did not get a hair in my food here yesterday because this used to be one of my favorite places .
beautiful crowd great prices on drinks friday night with karaoke by rambo i love the dick .
wish they baked bread got a boring cookie twice whole thing seems pretty unnecessary .
this is the kinda place where you get so fcked up that you end up down the street face down in the mud w your pants around your ankles covered in vomit five stars worthy of drunkeness .
the food is really good but the service pretty bad maybe they just had a bad day but i wont risk going back again .
if you cant get in the door for brunch itll be worth it i would give it more stars if i could plus the bartender sasha was absolutely delightful she should get a raise .
had a disastrous brunch here today several menu items were already unavailable even though we arrived at 1130 am a friend ordered the quiche and it was liquid and inedible and it was hotter inside than the pleasant weather outside disappointing all around .
wow so good hallelujah took my girlfriend here and she liked it and shes super picky win win .
i know its williamsburg i know things are expensive but 6 for a thimbleful of lentil soup still just seems wrong the soup was ok but the price left a bad taste in my mouth hard to enjoy your lunch when you feel youre being ripped off .
amazing chicken and waffles nice cozy atmosphere but its a little too noisy to hear the person next to you .
this place couldnt accomodate my dietary restriction by making cous cous or rice without butter so i left vegans and lactards beware .
atmosphere was nice service was great food was awesome we had oysters french fries cornbread fried chicken and waffles all delicious .
dirty drunk owner warm beer empty bar rude bartenders head next door to pier 76 or 120 bay cafe for a cleaner and better experience .
they played 50 cent wutang during brunch need i say more .
i disagree that this is a best kept secret i came here with my sorority sister and her family and they mixed up my order with her brothers well doneness of the burger and the fries were nasty if you want a burger go to a steakhouse .
came here on a whim for dinner so happy we did fried chicken steak pecan sundae and panna cotta were all ridiculously good great ambiance too .
we were disappointed in the food here the sauces were pretty bland everything was extra greasy i agree with another review that this was food in a pinch but better off going elsewhere for a decent meal .
the food was delicious the portions are large and the sides have a great variety outdoor seating for your pets attentive staff and moderate prices .
this is not a great buffet place for the price the selections were limited the food was not very fresh .
loved brunch here i recommend the eggs florentine not sure that it is always worth the crazy wait time though we waited 45 minutes for 2 people on a saturday aroun 1145 come just when they open or during off hours .
extremely poor service we looked at the menu were rushed by the waitress and then basically ignored when we were ready .
hot popovers with honey and crunchy salt with every meal need i say more always good food here and a good time theyve been able to keep their quality up over the years which is nice .
if you like the fk you attitude go there enjoy this place treats customers as if they are doing you a favor to let you in and serve you if you like being the slave go food is just ok mostly one time visitors tourist .
i absolutely loved this place for brunch i had the pork chop and waffles it was awesome as were the eggs that i swiped from bffs plate only downside was the lack of a kids menu anyhoo i plan to return often .
dont get the hype the corn was good but its not worth waiting 30 minutes for a lukewarm mound of rice and clod of refried beans .
we all agreed our food was excellent i had the friend pork chop with a cheese waffle the pork chop was more like wienerschnitzeel from pork with a great breaded crust and was delicious the cheese waffle was also delicious overall i recommend this restaurant highly .
i had been craving their food especially the corn but was rewarded with a 20 gratuity on a table for two do they do this to all their european diners .
sweet atmosphere great selection tasty good price is right not much else i can say about this place didnt wait long although it was busy got the buttermilk pancakes with smoked bacon and scrambled eggs .
this place is trash i would get better service in a dumpster the food is disgusting the place is cramped the bitch who served us was the rudest bitch i ever met .
overall very nice experience food drinks and deserts were all good our server was great as well .
so rude not even busy but the hostess sat a bunch of people that came in after us because she had something stuck up her ass prepare to wait and not be served .
get here right when they open or before great breakfast and lunch foods different types of bloody marys .
terrible overrated food overpriced cheap small portions tiny crowded space people of normal weight and size wont be comfortable sitting in this space they dont even offer free chips and salsa do not go out of your way to go to this terrible place .
omg their chicken and waffles is ridiculously delicious likely the best fried chicken ive ever tasted .
the food is overrated except for the corn the corn is good hostess was a b not cool .
i love everything about this restaurant their menu is simple but seasonally reflective their food is amazing im a huge fan of their mussels and their brunch the service is always attentive and their cocktails are great .
this place is whack under seasoned food i had the roast pork it was too wet and the rice was mushy aint nobody got time for that i know good food and this was not it drinks were ok but nothing that would make me want to return .
been here for dinner and for brunch yet to be disappointed food is always very well seasoned and flavorful without being overwhelming by far the best chicken and waffles ive ever had hands down but all else is also delicious pecan pie sundae a must .
worst place and rudest place u will eat in nyc go somewhere anywhere better not even worth one star .
excellent it may be the best eggs benedict in ny loved it on a home style biscuit three types of bloody marys so delicious we got a side of the cheddar waffle didnt really taste the cheddar so i wouldnt recommend .
not sure what all the fuss is about corn is great but quesadilla and burger nothing extraordinary guacamole lacking heat big time overall this place for me is not worth the wait i prefer la esquina by mile .
service was awesome my steak was good green sauce on it was rare yet i dont see where the name butter milk is from buttermilk chicken my friend ordered wasnt milky at all .
worst service ever prices are reasonable for the area and the food is good service at this place just puts it on my banned restaurant list .
i really enjoyed our family brunch here this past weekend the environment was relaxed yet spirited the food was hearty and well prepared the service was friendly this is definitely now the go to spot for weekend brunch i look forward to trying out dinner here as well .
terrible line how dare you make yvonne chan wait shes a princess no one makes her wait .
their bbq oysters were bomb their fried chicken is mediocre and cannot compare with pies n thighs atmosphere is chill and they have a nice restroom .
disappointing everything we had was tasteless and the corn was mediocre at best i dont know what all the hypes about pretty lame .
chicken and waffles nothing more need be said first cornbread ive allowed myself to eat north of the masondixie and i was not disappointed always a decent sized crowd but the wait time is very reasonable great cocktails and great service a must try .
this place is overrated the food isnt worth the hour plus wait i have to say the corn is amazing i recommend ordering it to go from the side cafe on elizabeth save time and money .
monday night prix fixe choice of appetizer main dessert 25 but monday the special is their amazing fried chicken and waffles and you can finish with a pecan pie sundae its usually packed so get there early .
the place is small but has a relaxed atmosphere the wait was about 1 hour to seat 3 of us place is small just try the grilled corn you dont have to wait to be seated just order it and go youre not missing out on anything else .
it seems chicken and waffle joints are popping up all over brooklyn these days none of then come close to buttermilk channel the chicken is expertly seasoned paired with a cheddar waffle and balsamic sauce that is mesmerizing you will be dreaming about this chicken for days .
disappointing not cuban bad service .
theres usually a wait but its worth it if you dont have a large party try your luck at the bar for an open spot .
my friend got food poisoning here last week yuck not only is this place not worth the price or the overcrowding but now you have to risk getting sick here .
i have been there twice and the food is really good i love the neighborhood too and if your lucky you can seat outside and enjoying the sun i loved the pancakes there so yummi and the service is nice too so place to go .
awful cuban sandwich the service is friendly enough and its in a great location i guess stick to the corn on the cob .
went on a sunday afternoon for brunch place was packed inside but the weather was nice so we didnt mind the outside seating waitress was very nice and attentive as well as helpful i ordered the waffles and porkchop awesome mimosas were mimosas definitely would come back .
what a disappointment skinny dry waffle with some dayold fruit on top little cup with coffee and a waitress that could not be bothered to refill it .
their brunch is really one of the best things about living in this neighborhood yes you have to wait that said i think they do a good job of managing the crowd the bloody mary with the oyster on top and that pork chop good lord .
below average food i dont think its worth the wait and i wouldnt go back i had a chicken dish and corn im not a big fan of the corn its so drenched in mayo youre pretty much eating corn flavored mayo .
the service was excellent the atmosphere as well i had the duck meatloaf and it was great no one in my party had a complaint about the food i will definitely be back when i am in the neighborhood .
perhaps its due to my lack of hipsterness but i was not enamoured with cafe habana not terrible but definitely not great mexican .
this place is adorable and the food is awesome believe the hype i had the homemade pickles as a starter and the fried chicken best fried chicken that ive ever had by far do it .
the quality has gone down and ive gotten sick from the food .
brunch is always fantastic eating at the bar is first come first served .
got the avocado and cheese burrito flavorless horchata grainy overall i just blew 11 maybe i should have bought groceries instead of wasting my money on bad food .
always great food great service and long lines .
ive since had real elote at the red hook ball fields it was about 1 345 better than this place and cheaper fuck cafe habana .
perfection .
this place is terrible the yellow rice in the vegetarian burrito actually has chicken stock in it when i tried substitute it with white rice i was give a serious attitude and informed that the chef would not allow it so much for a green restuarunt .
went here last night with a couple of new brooklynites we loved it really relaxed atmosphere but still popping i started with the cauliflower soup and ordered the pork breaded and waffles if you have not tried this place yet you are missing out .
nothing special on the food too many people i dont get why this place is so popular even though i live in neighborhood i dont come here anymore i just get corn sometimes the food on116 east mexican halem food is much way better .
had a good evening out with my best friend and daughter we chose the chicken and waffles which tasted great my waitress was such a nice lady she was very welcoming and warm cant wait to go back for brunch .
i hated this place it was pumped up way too hard and when i got there the food was not that good service was slow also id rather get some sushi at oyama .
another great brooklyn restaurant all the quality and atmosphere without the steep prices and cutthroat competition to get a table the lamb salad was great could have had a little more lamb however but the friend chicken is really their star will be back for that .
wait staff sucked giving it 2 stars asked for a bloody mary wasnt told they offered a multitude of signature ones breakfast was just ok .
my partner and i ordered 3 breakfast plates to share between us the portions are very large here the food comes out piping hot and the service is fantastic sit outside for a lovely view would definitely revisit .
ordered steak frites steak was very tough would not order again wife had tuna salad which was great .
food was delicious i had the pecan french toast to die for bacon and cheddar waffles mmmm mmmm good .
done not the place it use to be expensive drinks with well liquor cold food didnt want to send back as my husbands was ok stupid and the prices are way out of control .
the oysters the terrine the fried chicken the mashed potatoes the drinks all were fantastic .
steak is not bad breakfast corn beef is absolutely terrible service is hit or miss and so is the food upstairs space offers nice and unusual for downtown view of church st .
buttermilk channel offers a consistent staple based brunch menu to eager brooklynistes theres usually a 60 min wait for weekend brunch service here is prompt and friendly but not overbearing buttermilk channel is definitely worth your time if you have dont mind waiting for a table .
nice place but for the price of the cocktails they really could have been better dont know about the food .
delicious fried chicken for dinner dont skip the biscuits duck meatloaf was good brunch was amazing fried pork and cheddar waffle the scrambles are simple but they must do something magical to those eggs .
would also echo that service was not great waiter told table near ours about specials but failed to tell us .
awesome brunch place food is very very well prepared service is great but the wait sucks cant really blame them considering so many people want to eat there cheddar waffles were amazing i would def come back here yum .
worst pizza ever i would make pizza yourself before ordering from here i wouldnt be surpised if it was once frozen i dont know what else to say besides that the food is just really horrible .
this is possibly my shortest review ever but not much else needs to be said delicious food refreshing drinks fantastic service awesome ambiance great for dates or family brunch worth the trip to carroll gardens the pork chop cheddar waffle was heavenly .
i got 2 slices of cheese pizza and a soda the pizza was awful was bland and looked like something youd get from the freezer section of your local supermarket .
good fried chicken .
ginos is okay they are very convenient i will say the delivery is fast and its reasonably priced as for the food mediocre the pizza is good enough if you need delivery but not great ginos is decent and convenient but nothing special .
all i have to say is chicken and waffles .
i went here tuesday for lunch but i left emptyhanded why because they ran out of pizza at 2 in the afternoon .
yea its that good make sure you save some room for a jelly doughnut yum .
pizza is below average crust is soggy and toppings do not taste fresh my search for a local pizza joint will continue .
the brunch here is fantastic great pancakes great coffee great biscuits really havent had anything on the menu i wouldnt recommend .
unfortunately im giving up on this place pizza is still alright was never great but phone ordering has become a joke and in the last 5 or 6 times ordering from there if it wasnt pizza it was mostly garbage wraps are the worst .
the most incredible fried chicken ever the sliced pickles and cheese waffles are great compliments and friendly service too .
fool me once shame on you fool me twice you get two stars on yelp gave the sicilian pie a try again after forgetting how gross it was a few years ago damn shoulda stuck to the oily goodness of la pizza instead .
delicious friendly service in a great environment .
the food was crappy the service was crappy why on earth did the historic wethersfield website recommend this place do they hate tourists that much .
maybe the best pancakes ive ever had and an excellent hostess with a very accurate estimate of waiting time short rib hash a bit greasy and fatty no wolllensky grill here but excellent meal overall .
i ordered the tom ka soup on friday the chicken was still raw i sent it back they took it off the check but either way it shows carelessness check your food before you eat it .
nothing not to like options for everybody try the pork chops and waffles .
good food terrible service some of these people are so rude especially the older woman hostess i will take my business elsewhere .
pretty great place across the board i basically assign five stars to places that ace the appetizer entree dessert drinks service and decor categories and this place did it for me on my visit nice reason to go to gowanus .
good food horrible and rude service so i will give a 2 very rude that i do not want to go back .
fav new brunch spot the pancakes are delish and so fluffy .
worst pad thai and thai fried rice such basic dishes what a shame .
the buttermilk fried chicken and french toast are the best love the food and the staff are very accommodating .
the food was decent service was mediocre .
every time ive eaten here ive been so so happy the food is amazing and the staff is the best truly the nicest people so veg friendly too and pretty the restaurant is beautiful and the bathrooms are very sweet .
the only good thing about ninos is their pizza their pasta dishes range from passable to disgusting they do get the orders up quick so they do in a pinch .
buttermilk channel i cannot express how deeply felt my love is for you and your beautiful fried chicken and waffles i want to eat them all day everyday for the rest of my life thank you thank you .
a fantastic dining experience if you enjoy pubic hair and the chemical smell of rubbing alcohol in your food i just tried the basalmic chicken sandwich and was lucky enough to experience both of those things .
great for a brunch date i love the pork chop with cheddar waffles yum get there early cause it gets packed quick .
decent food but the kitchen was slllooooooowwww clearly a problem as the waitstaff was clustered at the pass through and nothing was coming out for ages the waitstaff was excellent in keeping the patrons patient .
a must go for sunday brunch get there early theres always a line dinner is just as exceptional my go too venue and never fails to disappoint .
we arrived on sunday just 5 minute before they closed their kitchen for the afternoon technically speaking they could have still served us and they were extremely rude about i do not recommend this place further the place was empty which infuriates me even more .
go and go often the entire menu is delicious nothing more to be said no i lied get there before the 11301230 rush if you dont want to wait too long .
had only half of the breakfast items that were from the yelp pics no eggs benedict no chicken and waffles not what i was expecting .
unpretentious and incredible everything ive ever had here is on par with the best food ive had in my life the fried chicken and waffles of course are signature and the cocktails are exceptional too .
waited 50 minutes for brunch then sat ipad buzztext notification was nice ordered the pulled pork benedict the benedict arrived the same temperature as the salad tasted ok nothing special not worth the wait imo .
i emailed buttermilk channel on wednesday and by friday i had 15 take out orders of fried chicken and waffles for my birthday party it was delicious and buttermilk channel was awesome to work with thanks .
after shopping for bridal gowns my daughter and i had lunch here the wine was excellent the food was just ok i had better i had the lamb burger and my daughter had the friedman burger will i visit again no .
had brunch here on a sunday the food was really good i had scrambles with mushroom spinach and goat cheese with a side of bacon .
food is good service is abysmal mussels used to be great now they are flavorless pizza is still good i truly felt like i was disturbing the bartender by asking for anything the pounding gangsta rap was offensive .
quality is unparalleled and service is beyond exceptional quite simply i love this place and i love it even more when their monday menu doesnt break the bank .
poor service aggressively priced drinks didnt try the food though the pizza looked good .
delicious food great service lovely hostess thank you for a great brunch .
just went to in riva in east falls birra cant compete with them in riva has amazing pizza in a great atmosphere with outdoor seating .
i dream about this dessert would love the recipe so unbelievably delicious .
this place felt like a bunch of processed food from the supermarket had been presented with creativity on my plate the taste was not very impressive quite mundane actually .
delicious .
service was good manager was rude and disorganized about reservations and food order fried oysters fish with soba noodles and scallops were ok my companion had a fly in her drink they didnt even comp her drink my companion ended up with food poisoning from eating her food .
could not stop eating the fried chicken delicious .
boston creme had no creme i hope i just got a bad batch .
i went there a while ago food was tasty and well thought out a lotta buttery rich food delicious .
ok so in a haste i stopped here for a quick capp before an appt holy crap worst coffwe experience of my existenceeeeee it was milk the poor gal being the contest was less than apologetic n doesnt drink coffee so i couldnt blame her ignorance .
holy my fried chicken the skin is perfect and crisp while the meat is tender and juicy great service great cocktails be ready for a serious wait .
eh could have been better but its a nice location and set up the cupcakes were pretty bland i got 10 varieties and was ate them im sure i will give them another shot another time .
i love everything about this place went for brunch and it knocked my socks off the pecan caramel sweet roll is not to be missed the huntington benedict was superb just really loved it .
its ok not the best cupcakes but its in an easy to access location probably wouldnt come back unless it was on my way somewhere and i was really emphasize on the really desperate for a cupcake .
the french toast is heavenly i took away one star because the wait time for a table was over an hour long .
was pretty disappointed the sushi was not fresh and still somewhat frozen ramen was ok but definitely had much better .
very delicious i had the apple and cheddar grilled cheese which was fantastic we also shared the almonds which were to die for service was great also very friendly and accommodating definitely will go back .
ordered the broiled salmon which is served over quinoa and spinach unfortunately the spinach was riddled with sand the salmon was overdone this place was a favorite but apparently it changed management ownership a while back dont think ill return .
this was definitely worth the trip from manhattan i have a ridiculous number of allergies so i played mix and match with the omelet ingredients which they were more than happy to oblige on oh and cheap brunch drinkswho can hate a brunch with oodles of bellinis .
fancy place nice loungy vibe i went there after seeing all the rave reviews on yelp one word msg will not go back to a place that still uses such cheap trick to make food tasty .
delicious fried chicken and mash great service .
um who in nyc charges extra for eggs pork veg etc oh its zutto i dont think im going to return to a place that taste like nissin noodles and charges top dollar plus charges extra for addins .
tasty brunch fine service nice crowd .
nothing phenomenal here folks .
pecan pie french toast is heaven in your mouth the scrambled egg with loxcream cheese wasnt amazing but not bad servicewise my two visits to this brunch spot have been excellent the ambience is cozy and comforting and the staff friendly and attentive .
not even close to ippudo totto or momofuko what a shame doesnt seem to be stellar ramen in tribeca also took 30 minutes to serve and i was the only one in the restaurant whats up with that .
i had an excellent meal here recently when going out for my birthday the space is bright and inviting and they offer two menus their usual and vegetarian everything that came to our table looked beautiful and tasted great im excited to go again in the future .
what a rip off 4 shrimp for 12 are you kidding me instead of 3 buns they bring out 2 now ramon was good service was also good i will never go again though .
aside from the food being pretty perfect the staff were fabulous helpful and fun learned of a new great drink an aperol spritzer its aperol and champagne just yummy cant wait to go back .
i had much higher hopes the food was underwhelming and bland even the sautéed onions lacked flavor the best tasting part of the meal was the packaged potato chips i wish i could leave a better review the staff was pleasant enough but seemed a bit apathetic .
lovely great for brunch and dinner long line for brunch put your name in and go for a walk .
disappointing do not go here for breakfast very limited choices they have dropped corned beef hash and home fries from the menu instead all they serve are french fries clearly they have snubbed the breakfast crowd i will not return .
3 words simply the best the chef is amazing the staff is awesome im in heaven anytime im there will be there agin for the 4th time i cant help it .
this place is seriously overrated the little stuff was not bad pickles slaw the sandwitches we outright lousy though the pastrami meat quality was terrible tough and grissley the prices are sky high especially for what you get service was slow and arrogant skip this place .
this is my alltime local favorite my go to place in the neighborhood food is outstanding innovative always a great new special dish to try great beer on tap good wine list my favorite dish is the duck meatloaf followed by the pecan pie sundae for dessert .
food looks great but ive been standing here waiting 30 freakin mins for a sandwich i seriously think my head might explode if i hadnt already paid id be long gone by now .
great fried chicken great duck meatloaf great drinks great atmosphere voted best by the table was the mustard glazed grilled bacon appetizer .
for connecticut its good thats not saying much at all meh is exactly the right term .
what can i say excellent staff well worth the bike ride for brunch just try the amazing salmon scramble .
my pasta with chicken in scampi sauce was delicious but the burger i took to go i asked for medium well and i got a raw burger when my mother opened and bit into it i hope she doesnt get sick burgers are a no at this restaurant .
pancakes mimosas .
inconsistent food terrible service kitchen lacks attention to details never returning to this location .
the hake was truly amazing fresh affordable oysters were simply divine great little spot for a good price cheers .
the food here is mediocre and not worth the wait time the only reason i would return is for the cheesecakes they have a huge selection try the dulce de leche cheesecake its not overly sweet and you can really taste the caramel .
great food great service .
wanted to try it boring corporate food .
the brunch at buttermilk is so yummy no wonder its almost impossible to get at table here yes we are big fans of it management and ownership are awesome kind friendly warm super nice people they do really care and have appreciation for their customers we loved it .
this place is very overrated and not worth the long wait their cheesecake is very good whoop de doo it isnt worth waiting two hours for .
go on monday get fried chicken that is all .
the customer service was really bad i would not go back there again i had a two hour wait .
i had the hash and a short stack of pancakes delish .
so overrated there is always a wait staff are ok at best i got sick from a chicken sandwich here so i avoid this place .
this place is da bomb long wait but well worth it .
you people are all crazy this is an over rated diner with good cheesecake everything is over salted everyone thinks it good because they have good ideas for dishes and they give you huge portions but quality means everything but honestly there is nothing worth going here for .
i come here for the fried chicken and for dessert the pecan pie i thought i was in heaven .
food is okay drinks are horrible almost no alcohol had to order an extra shot on the side for every drink i got horrible waitress i had took around 20 minutes to bring my friend water its a nice family environment i guess ehhh .
waited an hour on sunday to get a seat but the fried pork chop cheddar waffles were to die for service was good waitress was nice space is small but thats expected mimosa was complementary very nice sunday brunch spot .
server was great puffy bread delicious but disappointed in everything else spoiler alert none of the food is fresh except three of the deserts it is all brought in and frozen seriously .
daaaaaaaang but this place is the tastiest awesome and simple dinner menu done up right toasted brioche with honey when you sit down and pretty bangin coffee a nice place for a date with someone who is adorable .
food is not bad but nothing exceptional for this area do not ever order online they have it in their website but every time i try it they say 20 minutes and take 4045 not worth that hassle .
took my boyfriend here for his birthday the fried chicken was awesome and amazing the service wasnt as good plus we went right at busy dinner time and it was reeeeeally loud but the food was so good id totally go back .
decent if youre into gluttonous food everything was covered in an insane amount of cheese and ingredientscooking is mediocre at best much better restaurants nearby .
consistently good food at good prices brunch is usually crowded and there are no reservations but overall its worth it salmon scramble is delish pecan pie french toast great as long as you like very sweet stuff .
ive had much better the pasta dish i had was dry and overdone open a can of chefboyrdee and you will have something better .
good times great food amazing staff if they have the orange wine from scholium project give it a go .
worse dinner i have ever had sauce was like a weak tomato soup no flavor at all muscles full of sand would not recommend at all .
great restaurant lobster pot pie duck meat loaf chicken and waffles here are all amazing but the best dish is the free dish the pop overs are outrageous here i can eat those all day .
service was awful food took forever and arrived cold hostess was extremely rude dont go if you want a pleasant experience .
love it fried chicken and waffles is insane the service is supper helpful no reservation for parties less than 5 makes it harder to plan but truthfully its a great place to go as a group round them up and head over .
chicken parm was pretty good restaurant has a sportbar feel to it .
brunch was delicious and i love that a mimosa or bubbly comes with your meal the bar was packed even at 2pm on a saturday but the bartender made his sporadic attention up to us by buying us a drink .
had dinner with a large group of people for a work thing not bad probably would not go back unless im looking for a lunch spot in this area .
great food and relaxing atmosphere went for brunch and had an amazing pork chop and cheese waffles the bacon and almond appetizer excellent i want to try the fried chicken which i hear is the best thing on the menu .
had pepperoni slices and they were extremly greasy would not recommend or return to this location .
went there for a brunch and had warm lamb romaine salad was excellent cant wait to go again and try more .
had a broccoli rabe and sausage slice asked for it well done and it came out a mushy mess you need to listen to your customers .
solid food solid service nice atmosphere burger was killer hush puppies and almonds are great bar snacks all the cocktails and drinks were right on the money .
the place is not very clean .
manhattan prices brooklyn attire the pre dinner bread is delicious .
nothing special ive seen it pretty packed on friday and sat nights mostly locals .
im a fan im so happy that this place is in my neighborhood i can always count on it and now they have wine on tap love that my only complaint is that when the top managers arent there the place feels different .
really bad food like dry cardboard i had the pepper steak and fried pork .
great wait staff wine lists speciality foods worth the wait .
sooo its been over an hour still waiting for the delivery man to get here not a happy camper to add we only received 56 shrimp stixs and a small container of tzatziki for a platter meant for 2people huge fail on their part .
great local food and for 10 in new york the brunch cannot be beat includes a fresh squeezed oj mimosa or bellini but no alcohol before noon on sun word to the wise great friendly service really exceptionally friendly and beef hash was amazing .
food is good service is bad sweating while eating until we could finally flag one of the 5 waitresses to turn on a fan it must be hard for 5 servers to take care of 8 tables .
the prefix monday menu is well worth the moola comfort food at its best .
stinx im from mediterranea and this place is no medierranea crappy hummus in plastic cup questionable cuts o meat yes ill keep rambling but dont go here this doesnt represent my homeland ill take you somewhere nice .
good food not cheap gets really really loud note dont get seated all the way in the back specially lousy next to the hallway to the kitchen .
thanx but no thanx tried several times to like it but was always disappointed open late good coffees and beers but the food just isnt there .
one of my favorite restaurants in brooklyn the food is always fantastic and the atmosphere is great too often busy but they are very polite and its easy enough to wait for a table at nearby prime meats .
overpriced for the amount and quality of the food you get it should be half of what it costs the chicken stick was tasty but the lamb was way overcooked and low quality will not be returning here .
love the fried chicken and waffles also they have black maple hill bourbon which is nice in addition their oysters are fantastic next im going there for brunch .
when i had lunch here i was very disappointed the food was of very low quality specifically the kebabs and the prices are very high for the low quality food the staff is also not friendly if you sit at the bar .
nice restaurant i went for brunch and fell in love with the pankcakes i had already ordered and eaten the french toast which was ok i tasted my friends pancakes and they were so delicious that i had to order my own i ate every single bite .
its been 2 hours and ive been waiting for this place to deliver the rest of the items that they forgot in my order that i picked up the food is really good but its not worth waiting this long .
great place friendly staff yummy food yummy drinks cant go wrong we had dinner on a weeknight durning the holiday season had the pickles oysters both way bacon almonds duck meatloaf trout wrapped in bacon and a nightcap with the pecan sundae happy tummy .
just about the coffee got an iced mocha and it wasnt what i was expecting despite the whip cream they put on top it still tasted a little watery not much flavor staff was nice though .
great staff and beautiful spot the food was wonderful but the portions were a little small .
beefchicken kebobs stixs too fatty pita bread is not real pita just bread in the shape of pita ambiance weird too loud no character no sequence of songs .
up a star i had the fried chicken again its a little bready in spots but its super juicy and delish and the mashed potatos are buttery melty goodness maybe eating at 1230 am is the secret .
horrible customer service they care about the coming in whether or not your order is correct they dont care the lady is so bitchy and rude its unbelievable i told her over the phone i wanted delivery and she bluntly said no and hung up .
best fried chicken ever friendly wait staff try chocolate carmel tart with salted peanuts think youre in heaven no rez for parties under 6 no waiting for 4 on wed night in sept extensive vegetarian menu for nyc reasonable prices .
stopped in for brunch service was very slow food was okay nothing to write home about bathroom was gross other patrons were very rude .
consistently great brunch and a pretty decent dinner if youre trying this restaurant for the first time try the brunch and expect to wait a bit to be seated .
we used to eat here every few weeks takeaway however last time we ordered which was in early 2010 to be fair there was mouse poop in our rice weve never gone back and never will .
wonderful food that was both delicious and creative good ambiance except for too many loud children could have been there too early but it was very loud .
not very friendly or accommodating will not substitute or add any sauces that are different than their menu not impressed there are better italian restaurants .
best meal ive had in brooklyn and probably the entire city fried chicken and waffles a must .
the food was delicious but the service was dissapointing the hostess took 15 minutes to bring the menu to us the waitress seemed annoyed of her job .
the food is delicious the service is excellent and the atmosphere is great i wish they took reservations for parties smaller than 6 but such is life i especially like their vegetarian menu which makes it a great choice for group gatherings .
as youll see from the other reviews the service here is atrocious absolutely terrible food is average and beer list is good but for how many great restaurants are nearby i would not waste your time with the poor staff .
i wont bore you with paragraphs like these lovely people order everything but my memorable picks are french toast fried chicken pancakes bacon biscuits scrambles fried porkchops cheddar waffles and the burger the best brunch in brooklyn ftw .
so i typically praise dd a definite go to place for food and drinks the last few years that last few months things have changed service has been shotty brunch specifically they changed the menu and it doesnt seem its for the better .
duck meatloaf heaven .
this place is spitting distance from my house so i go every so often if it wasnt id have no reason to food is ok at best however brunch is awful good beer menu patchy service .
good beer great whiskey cool staff and awesome food what more can you ask for .
the bartender mikey is a total dbag hes also unattractive so not sure where the lousy attitude comes from best to go on a night when he isnt working because the other bartenders all rock great happy hour good music fun people mikey however is the worst .
great staff greeting you as you arrive the best duck meatloaf what i have ever tasted pecan pie sunday i feel like i am back in louisiana delish so glad my brooklynite friend decided i must try this one out .
terrible food and service .
just got back from brunch the salmon plate was out of this world update went back the next sunday and they were out of the salmon plate this time so got drunk instead .
worst bloody mary i think ive ever had at least it was only 3 dollars .
delicious scrumptious food eh service recommend the duck meatloaf and bay scallops entrees nice wine list loved the bonny doon rosé .
this place was worth going to but then they got rid of the brisket reuben .
i went last night and enjoyed an amazing dinner made of bacon everything was reasonably priced and service was good 1 maple bacon roasted almonds 2 delicata squash tart 3 baconwrapped brook trout 4 dougs pecan pie sundae .
food is hit or miss and a little overpriced for the portions the wait staff is subpar and the management is terrible used to like going here but there are a few bad experiences that have changed my opinion of this place .
a little out of the way unless you live nearby but this place is on point the duck meatloaf was superb .
i have tried to give this place many chances but the food is not good it needs to learn a thing or two from the royal tavern and south philly taproom beer selection is good but a bit pricey .
went to brunch to celebrate hubbys job situation for brunch it was really quite good pork chop was unbelievably tasty cheese waffles supreme everything was good loved the atmosphere sat at the bar and it was perfect didnt even need a table .
the ambiancedecor is swell i especially like the brick wall s the service had a bit of attitude not sure why the beer selection was extensive especially the belgians however the food was mediocre to our palates .
just love the brunch here a must do chicken adn waffles are delicious .
devils den is a very chill place to go and grab a drink with friends great beer selection bar staff is great and happy hour is solid as for the food eh the hostess was pretty rude so we didnt even bother stay for dinner .
amazing i was wowed by this place i took a friend for her birthday and boy did they impress the staff was super friendly the food was indescribably delicious and the ambiance was impeccable i suggest the cheddar waffles and the bread pudding .
theyre gone nooooo the new place food king or whatever is nowhere near as good .
sat at the bar for some snacks and drinks great cocktails chicken liver mousse was divine and so were the oysters sweet potato croquettes were very nice but could use a touch more flavor getting there early made all the difference must go back for the cheddar waffle .
i just want to add after a series of bad meals and a bad call on the hostesswaiters part we will not go back to this place .
had a great sunday afternoon here very unique and delicious dishes we both loved every bite also visited for brunch a couple of weeks back very busy but well worth it .
omg i went here and hardly remember it well guess thats the experience .
great place for brunch nice atmosphere and great inside just be prepared to brave a crowd .
a great place to take a client if want average smallportion food that would be forgettable if the pasta appetizer wasnt so salty that i could barely taste the freezerburned ice cream i spent 225 with tip and got a slice of pizza on the way home .
i am fan now i had the pecan pie french toast and it was divine excellent for for great brunch price brunch time there is a madhouse but what can you expect for such a wonderful place mmmmmmmm .
the place is cute but the service absolutely sucks it was such a bother to them when i asked what were the pastries since they dont label them and the price is high too for average tasting food and drinks never go back there again .
only been here for brunch with a friend but damn best french toast of my life pecan encrusted with a gooey inside very very rich coated in molasses i loved it and savored every damn bite good coffee too .
this place has potential but isnt quite there yet i would have liked to have seen the food made to order instead of in a cold case the fact that they use a packet for espresso drinks instead of real coffee was the biggest disappointment .
absolutely delicious and a beautiful space its clear that the owners are very passionate about what theyre doing if i lived in that neighborhood it would become a regular stop .
this places food is nothing to jump for the only thing i enjoyed was the chicken fingers and thats only because of the sauce everything is just basic bar food not worth it to me i will not be returning .
been twice and its deff a popular neighborhood spot the bar make a terrific drink the food is top notch without pretentiousness and the room is casual and comfortable .
its close to shusl and rutgers but its divey and not in the cool way .
love this newest edition to carroll gardens spicerubbed baby back ribs squash tart pumpkin pasta and lots more im looking forward to going back and trying great service friendly and attentive warm inviting room great place .
i didnt order from here because there was no trace of any menu online anywhere need to know whats on offer before ill give a place a try .
villa barone is a great place been going for years and never had a bad meal chicken milanase is amazing nice salad before the meal and bread is homemade and fresh dont miss out on this place .
great food but way too noisy even when you ask the staff to turn down the loud music so that you can talk they refuse in a passiveaggressive way will not return i dont want to have to wear earplugs when eating breakfast .
being a manhattan snob leads to constant disappointment when elsewhere not so with this place though superb service and tasty food didnt order a dish we didnt like from the appetizers to the mains skipped dessert though because we were so full its byob so enjoy .
wack wack wack if youre going to spend the time to come there might as well go to mogador nothing special and inconsistent .
excellent food their pizza is for take out only however its delicious they have brick oven pies its byob the dishes are of good size and very tasty its gets busy on the weekends .
everything about this place screamed okay i wanted to like it i live nearby its small cute off the tourist and b t map problem is the food had three dishes and two different wines ambience and decor is just average not worth a second trip .
their calzones are great and their pizzas try the garlic knots the older italian man seems to be part owner not sure but definitely a nice guy .
not a soul food joint one would expect to find authentic soul good this is a corporate restaurant with a soul food menu food is fair as are the drinks .
service is great and has a nice atmosphere it was very hot the day we went so that may have affected the quality of the food i will definitely be back again .
the service was great but the food was blah i ordered the ribs and bbq wings while my bf got the damn good chicken neither were very good the chicken had a metal twig thing in it so be careful if you decide to eat here .
the pizza here is great .
terrible overpriced food dry pulled pork cardboard catfish afterthought salad 38 bucks caveat emptor .
i really like tommys their cheese steak hoagies are the best they use real steak pizza is good but thats about all that ive had from them they have a small dining area and service is friendly last time we ate there the guy was really nice .
so far really not happy what type of place doesebt allow you to try the soup gumbo before ordering it bartenderserver kinda witchy about it too have received my food yet and not a good vibe about this place yet no cider or gluten free advertised either .
locally the best food this side of central and northern jersey hands down the brwn stew chicen is the best take your food to go not in the best lication but good food .
the food is horrible meat overcooked too dry to eat looks like it comes from frozen microwaveable food from grocery the food doesnt come as it is described the menu .
byob great food even better staff casual atmosphere with great ambience just a great local italian restaurant where you see alot of the same faces great for familys .
food was below average and service was slow despite being only one of two tables in the entire restaurant .
this restaurant is byob which is a plus to the already delicious and fresh menu ive been coming here for years and tend to order the seafood salad fettuccine alfredo and chicken alla casa this is authentic italian at its best tasty filling and inexpensive you cant lose .
mediocre food slow slow service ive tried it 3 times now and it is always the same .
randomly discovered this place 2 yrs ago and have been a regular ever since the pear cake is my top favorite the almond cookies and the spinach pie are amazing she is such a nice person herself .
seriously no our bill 2 people for one beer and three or four super small plates was almost 100 each plate had maybe three bites on it the menu descriptions were misleading as well not happy about the experience wont be returning unfortunately .
i just adore this tiny hidden gem loved the baklava and the almond cookie just as good as my mothers too bad its so far away from queens cant wait to try the spinach pie great job koukla keep it up .
i wouldnt recommend this place to anyone not even someone who couldnt tell good vegetarian food from bad and please dont order the broccoli rabe you might choke to death i doubt if anyone who works there knows how to do the heimlich maneuver but they should .
outstanding the spinach pie is as good if not better then my yiayias greek for grandmother .
just finished eating a takeout biriyani its soggy no flavor and worst ever biriyani i have eaten i doubt ill go back here again .
for a second just forget about the greek financial meltdown no matter what aftershocks it created enjoy the delicious 4 spinach pie 3 baklava you can sense a warm earthy homely feeling the care and effort put into making the pie when the lady serves it .
i was lured in by their dinner buffet but both the selection and the quality were lacking for something id been looking forward to all day it was pretty disappointing dishes were fairly bland staff was bored .
loved the spanakopita thought it was a deal for 4 after all do you know how long it takes to make this stuff will be head back again .
i ordered chicken vindaloo and shrimp curry yesterday and was sooo disappointed both dishes consisted of the same tomato sauce bland base curry into which some boiled chicken and shrimp were placed ill never order from here again totally yuk .
to be fair i have only had one thing at boubouki so far but it has me coming back often for it the chocolate chip cookies seriously it might be the best cookie i have ever had looking forward to exploring everything else they have to offer .
went for buffet crap food all the below good review does seem to be from the owner himself fyi we went on sunday afternoon 0526 please avoid and save your bucks .
this place was absolutely fabulous i highly recommend both the carrot cake and the pear cake which were both flavorful and moist the owner is such a lovely sweet woman definitely worth the trip i cannot wait to go back cash only i believe .
drove by a couple of weeks later and those boards of wood were still up in the front window not ok satish palace .
ive had only her pear cake and i loved it i prefer my desserts not be too sweet lower quality desserts mask their low flavor with sugar and the cake is perfect it was also very light and airy .
an unassuming and unpretentious eatery offering decent food and good service prices are reasonable and the broad street cafe is worth a try when passing through the area .
had the baklava it was fantastic nothing beats a sunday morning stop at essex market a piece of baklava and maybe a chai latte from porto rico the woman who runs boubouki is super nice and clearly puts her heart into the food she makes i definitely recommend .
no delivery on a saturday night i dont understand how you pick and choose when you deliver .
for a second just forget about the greek financial meltdown no matter what aftershocks it created enjoy the delicious 4 spinach pie 3 baklava you can sense a warm earthy homely feeling the care and effort put into making the pie when the lady serves it .
this used to be my most favorite place in the world been coming here for years they took away my three favorite dishes curry chicken soba noodles and sunshine burger it breaks my heart but i will never go back i was a loyal customer .
tasty greek pastry nook amazing spanakopita very nice owner who is great to talk to definitely a spot to stop at when youre in essex street market .
worst service ever .
its all about the oldstyle charm ice cream is good lots of chocolates but its real draw is the atmosphere kinda too bad the sopranos thing has tinted their authenticity .
beware worst customer service ive ever experienced after being threatened by the owner jeremy spector on account of their incompetence i will never support this restaurant again .
old school perfection real turkey club mint chip egg creams yum fast friendly service clean and cared for parlor .
if you get a reservation here dont expect them honor it hostess was rude unprofessional and had poor customer service skills .
ive been critical of the service of past but lately the staff sorry girls are much better about being attentive as a customer i totally appreciate it when theres an improvement in service and quality and i believe holstens has been doing both .
kale caesar salad needed more dressing croutons and cheese polenta needed cheese salt and pepper juice glasses of wine were teeny however service was quick and very pleasantid up this to 2 5 stars if i could .
great homemade ice cream and great burgers and sandwiches .
the pasta was good but the portions were served on a small salad plate with a 1012 price .
awesome homemade icecream i had the brownie chocolate sundae which was to die for highly highly recommend this place .
congee is the best and only under 5 only one thing i dont like is dirty floor and chairs that all add up to uncomfortable to order more to eat .
great spot for homemade ice cream efficient service hard working kids this place has been around for some time can get crowded at times so be prepared .
horrible customer service twice now i have ordered food only to get there and be told there is no food used to be a decent restaurant i would stay away from it .
the icecream here is amazing its the only thing weve had when weve been here the icecream is delicious and creamy and tastes very good i like the sundaes too as they are reasonably priced and delicious .
the interior make over is refreshing compared to the previous layout and decor large wooden dance floor area .
the best ice cream in the area personally i love their malteds great place to bring the kids .
they charge for the containers dont do delivery .
takes you back to the 60s good food nostalgic atmosphere right out of an archie comic good place to stop for a quick bite the orignal type of friendlys restaurants .
i am all for holeinthewall type places but that is no excuse for cleanliness the pho was pretty goodperhaps a little oily for my taste .
great ice cream the rest of the food is nothing special though love the ambiance though .
i was excited when i bumped into this pho restaurant but my disappointment came when they ignored my presence it was obviose they did not want to take my order as they continually passed my table serving others if i was vietnamese would it had been different .
the ice cream here is great and i love the burgers here too i dont usually have burgers but every time i come here ill always get one great service too .
went for lunch with wife this weekend 1228 why sushi shack only 2 items sushisashimi lotsa rolls ordered chirashi maybe 67 pcs small and thinly sliced sashimi on small bowl of rice only seating on benches at communal tables will not be going back .
came here post run from the park and had their maple walnut ice cream on a cone delicious and just what ive been craving homemade tastiness even the cone was tasty they also put a lot on the single cone which i liked .
the staff was great but sadly the food was underwhelming they seem to be trying to put a new spin on a food that was already perfected .
best grilled cheese around hands down ice cream is good especially mint chocolate chip is amazing .
came in multiple times to try different things the servers are lovely but food is so underwhelmingly average for the price .
solid place i enjoy the burgers with a cherry smash and chocolate chip mint ice cream for dessert .
its overpriced and not worthy for the money the bill for two people comes to 120 the shrimp is good black cod is good but the party bomb and the sushi have too much rice not good value i will not come back again .
great food service is okay typical place for a college kid to work and take for granted that said the ice cream is really good rip james gandolfini .
guacamole sushi no thanks and a waitress who doesnt quite understand the significance of a customer having a serious food allergy ill move on .
time travel back to the 50s hope it never changes great icecream .
overrated the appetizers were decent but the sushi had far too much rice and was just eh also the hipster lighting is atrocious and made me nauseous i appreciate the concept but not the execution will stick to robertas next time i find myself in the area .
went here because this was the final scene for the sopranos .
i gave momo another try fail the karage was oily overcooked and bland the bombs were very fishy 5 stars for service but once again the food was a completely disappointment .
best homemade ice cream and chocolate you can get hands down .
i waited about 45 minutes for a roll that i finished in 45 seconds .
coffee chip ice cream with great slabs of dark chocolate are made in the basement in stainless steel drums that go through a hard freeze softening and final freeze process that yields the creamiest most flavorful ice cream .
closed .
try the onion rings as far as im concerned theyre the best in the state .
the food is good the price is cheap no delivery service pickup only .
best ice cream in town .
this place is terrible the waiter takes order very slow is extremely rude and keep on yelling at customers the food is also awfully bad and the plates look really greasy it is the worst chinese restaurant that ive tried so far .
had a brief encounter with this place while visiting nycnj area this week mint chip ice cream was great .
mehh the pork and chive dumplings were subpar the covering was waay thicker than it should have been with no flavor doused it in the vinegar hot sauce and it was edible .
sopranos last episode was shot here the icecream is fabulous fresh homemade only 12 15 flavors but they are perfect nutty cocunut tons of nuts great shakes and great burgers yum yum .
used to like it but my last 2 visits were disappointing the broth doesnt taste as it used to be and yet the waiting time is unacceptable cheap food doesnt necessarily meant to be bad quality sorry i am not coming back .
this place is really good i would have given it five starts but they need to add a little more meat .
i find this place has fallen in quality and cleanliness dumplings were cold and noodles soup was super salty blech customers dumping all the leftover soup into an open bucket next to the customers who are still eating its disgusting .
we order from this place fairly often they are consistently good the subs are huge and moderately priced .
ordered the fried dumpling its big thats it thats the only positive comment i can give the skin is too thick and doughy this is my third disappointing visit not going back to this place anymore .
i love this place they always deliver on time and the food is really good and fresh thanks super hero xo .
my husband had their dumplings last night and is now suffering from food poisoning .
always delicious fast delivery i order once a week the large sub will feed you for days .
this is no longer a noodle house i recently tried to go there for some noodles only to find out that the store had changed i believe it is now some type of self serve hot pot restaurant very disappointed really wanted to have some hand pulled noodles .
great service friendly staff by the way bryan hooked me up a great sandwich man i love this store much success to you guys .
slowest delivery service ever by the time the food comes you could have driven there several times and back almost two hours for service i will definitely seek elsewhere next time .
i stumbled upon this shop twice now great little neighborhood spot tasty subs fresh ingredients clean shop and super friendly staff and surprisingly cheap i m definitely driving there every chance i get just for breakfast .
the food here is mediocre at best i will never go back to this place because their crappy soups spilled all over my car for a place that specializes in take out one would think that they would know how to pack liquids ugh .
what a bargain one of the biggest sandwiches youll ever have and a great price bread is fresh along with the cold cuts just surpassed blimpie as my favorite sandwich spot .
ok delivery thai food thai awesome is a much better option if you are willing to pick it up yourself doesnt even compare .
im not sure at what point in my life it became so difficult to get a great italian sub these are some nice people who are fixing some solid subs in jc they care it shows .
did not even compare to all the other thai restaurants i have had the food lacked spices or something that would have made it taste like authentic thai the set up inside and the food made this comparable to fast food thai .
enjoyed the noodles .
gave a different pizza shop a chance and thought it was ok a bit too cheesyoily for us though same with the garlic knots we would maybe return for the monday or tuesday night special .
cozy atmosphere friendly staff most importantly delicious dishes thumbs up overall for this soba spot would have been 5 stars but they do not take credit cards its 2015 guys will be returning .
the pizza here is iaght definitely not good but not bad either they need to take tips from those real pizza pros at italian touch on gill lane by the quickcheck .
it was really good the kimchee one smelled so good and savory i went a few hours before and now i am craving it again it is a really small place bring cash .
ordered take out broccoli rabe awful raw garlic these people obviously deliver to people that dont know any better poor excuse for italian style food order the chicken parm if your on a diet its so flavorless you wont waste your time worst food .
we love this place cold and hot soba the appetizers are also good super cheap so its a good value move it seems to fill up quickly but i havent found the wait to be that bad .
i went in to eat by myself so i sat down and waited and waited for someone to come to my table i ended up leaving i was ignored i never went back .
wow wow wow the flavors are off the chain i only got one of the sobas and silky tofu but i plan to go back to try it all on a very empty stomach .
this place use too be great but now no such good place terrible food now no good hope they better it .
cash only small space service was great and waitresses had good recommendations and was knowledgeable about the food and menu i cant remember what we ordered but i remember liking everything haha i do remember some tofu thing that i thought was awesome haha .
very rude owners and employees its a shame i like some of their food but will not order again .
eeeee delicious and filling they offer so many different components to the simple soba coming one after another best part is the asian waiter with and awesome voice too .
nothing special here is right the wings are only a little better than you can buy frozen lowquality blue cheese dressing comes with it which is more meh pretty disappointing wings for a place that has wings in the name .
cant get enough of the warm stamina soba 10 .
very disappointed cramped back table where servers had to reach over other diners rude inattentive possibly clueless waiter he slammed down glasses brought a halffilled wine bottle with no label med rare steak came finally well done tough so noisy we couldnt hear each other .
love this place cash only and there is usually a wait they dont take resies so go early .
came here for my moms birthday food and service were great but just after our meal a huge cockroach crawled up my nieces leg shortly thereafter another cockroach ran across the floor pretty disappointing after spending 250 wont be back .
so so so good been here three times in the rush and quiet and its been consistently amazing the burdock mera mera are both really good try the coconut shirukothe perfect dessert ill be back again and again and again .
pretty disappointed since we were looking forward to going to this place only bright spot was their mashed potatoes pommes puree which was really good .
delicious unique food id never been to a sobaspecialty restaurant before it is very small so it might be hard to get seated my large party went at an off hour and still had to wait 20min definitely worth it for a unique experience .
stopped in with a friend we had a couple of overcharged beers and as we were paying we had a surprise visit from a cockroach right on the bar will never go back .
come here for a healthy alternative whenever you have a ramen craving warm bowl of soba noodles will hit the spot this winter .
parc made me realize that french food is not my favorite cuisine i tried some of the wild mushroom soup it was thick and flavorless and the after taste was bitter i actually become a little queasy after a few bites .
homey style great place to be for small groups if you want to have a close conversation with your friend or your date this is the goto restaurant def recommend dip umai and healthy i love pouring soup in at the end and drink it up xd .
went for lunch food is still only okay menu is woefully boring service was better though .
great little place for soba noodles the service is very good menu explains the way everything is done for people like me who have no idea about this stuff although im not a seafood person and their broth is a bonita based broth food was very good .
all i have to say is this place is only good for one thing spring afternoon gawking at people walking by otherwise tres horrible .
this is as good as it gets best soba ever get the warm ones especially in the winter lean towards the curry ones and must get green tea affogato .
we were seated at a table outside and received zero service went inside to ask for our waitress three times and nobody ever came so that sucked .
the soba noodles and broth was great each seve regular or large and if you order the large its actually in the same siz3 bowl but more soba i see each bowl is weighted a certain amount of soba .
horrible horrible horrible i have been to parc twice both times the service was slow and the food was horrible i will not be going back .
best soba noodle i ever had .
phenomenal ambiance okay food okay service .
some of the best tasting soba ive ever had including in japan the service is a bit hit or miss but the food makes up for it they have variety of styles you can have your soba from hot broth hot dipping and cold dipping as well .
not as bad as i expected i hate theme restaurants french restaurants not run by french people but once again i wound up at a starr restaurant decent fries decent bread thats about it .
amazing so many options each time i go i try to get something new love this place keep in mind it is cash only which is sometimes annoying but the prices are very reasonable here so its fine will continue to go back .
i sooooo wanted to like this place bc of how it reps brooklyn and its criscrosse brunch pics on instagram epic fail slow service bad waiter and over cooked steak .
perfect soba noodles the place is small and run by japanese .
great wings tasty frozen drinks first time we went was really good the service was good and the mgr on duty was very friendly this past saturday we went back and caught an apparent shift change and have to say the service was terrible .
japanese soups has kimchi cash only .
the pizza was burned .
pros amazing kimchee pork dip soba get it with tempura fritters soba tea is 1 50 and tastes great gorgeous presentation cons absolutely long waiting line with only 1 bench available tips get their dessert the homemmade ice cream mochi is amazing .
the chili and cornbread was quite tasty and meaty and enjoyable the pork tacos were rather flavorless .
the kimchi pork dipping soba and silky tofu is the best to get here i love the presentation very japanese style and brings a neat experience the tea is authentic and soothing its sad to say the service needs more work though hopefully itll get better in time .
found a bone in my pulled pork sandwich didnt even get an im sorry instead i received thats not good the worst customer service ever guess thats why they have a truck and not a brick and mortar store .
authentic the best soba youll ever have and green tea thats magical plenty of veggie options too .
had scallion pancakes here really tough to chew never again service was slow too .
forget ramen soba is so much better there arent many authentic places serving japanese soba and this place is perfect .
very underwhelming too much batter on the fish n chips not that tasty bison burger too dry also not that tasty .
one of my new favorite restaurants in ny healthy crazy delicious affordable nicest staff ever the cold kimchee soba is out of control bonus fact they only play two songs and they loop back and forth between them all night .
dont do pick up terrible service i waited for 45 minutes past the pick up time and when i got home i realized that the order was incomplete the dishes you get when you take away are nothing like those served in the restaurant bad experience really disappointing .
good stuff next to the good stuff they also have funny graphics .
overpriced and subpar slow service .
this is a extention of my kitchen haters go find somewhere else cough cough .
i was excited to visit oaxaca kitchen because i love mole alas the traditional chicken mole was overly salty and unimpressive .
just found out today they have expanded with this new location same great food same great staff and chefs same zen and simplistic decor and same cult following what more can i say cocoron is my goto place for comfort food without the guilt .
not a mexican food restaurant just a mexican themed restaurant way overpriced .
everything is fantastic the rice balls and bread are amazing looking forward to trying some of there hot food .
ive had really good ethiopian food before and unfortunately this was not that good food was cold when it arrived except for the bread it tasted very heavy portions were small for the price .
great deli for the neighborhood italian specialties and many homemade products had a grilled chicken prosciutto mozz evoo hero delicious also picked up some frozen raviolis pumpkin and spinach .
more like pizza hut .
driving home from nyc on a sunday morning and we found this gem tucked back in a cute little wooded neighborhood we were pleasantly surprised and loved the atmosphere and the food was awesome if we ever pass through here again we will definitely visit this restaurant .
got half way through on order of wings before i noticed they were pink inside sure enough a few hours later i got sick thanks guys havent thrown up in a while it was exhilarating the wings were bad anyway delivery was relatively quick .
i went to for brunch and the food and service was good .
not a good value expansive for what you get small portions of salad it is very beautiful space good place to hang out and have a smoothy i recommend walking next door to hummus kitchen or so soom if you want a full meal for your money .
great food wonderful service and the owners are very personal as a business owner of a large growing business this is the service one would love to see wonderful atmosphere cant wait to go in the winter as well and have a nice coffee .
very bad service the waiters managed to ignore you when you arrive and rush your plates off while youre still eating the portion is small and the food is over priced not a very relaxing environment with selfconscious employees whose job is to stand around and doodle .
stopped in for breakfast this morning based on other reviews and we were not let down we got the whole wheat pancakes and chicken with waffles and it was all fresh and delicious well definitely be back .
i had a terrible experience here the service was lousy and the food tasteless will never go back .
such a great little find breakfast was excellent coffee was so good cant wait to come back for lunch .
ownermanager is a very rude lady server was nice food is decent but should be half the price for what you get wont visit again mostly due to the rude lady .
fantastic food really nice prices pleasant staff great location constant seasonal specials diverse selection of food new inventive recipes you cant go wrong with hapgoods .
not my cup of tea its park slope it suppose to be laid back and chill this place definitely belongs in the upper east side very frenchy waiting no so great food ok menu small mimosa nothing good prices sky high .
very good find we stumbled across hapgoods while looking for a breakfast option better than the local diners we were not disappointed the challah french toast with poached pears is amazing as was my cajun shrimp and grits we will certainly be back maybe every saturday morning .
average the food was ok and the serve was really bad .
met some friends there for sunday brunch and we all were very pleased the menu had many eclectic choices pulled pork omelets to the basic fare poached eggs the coffee was plentiful good and hot the staff attentive and they didnt rush us we would definitely go again .
rude bartenders mediocre drinks .
delicious my chicken cacciatore was wonderful the service was excellent and the owner was charming great evening .
drinks were good but our bartender short man with long curly hair was quite rude .
really enjoyed the food and atmosphere here great byob we came here once when it was a different restaurant and now the inside is much nicer and the service is really good the mussels were excellent and their main entrees are really tasty and large portions .
if you are not hungry and ready to spend money go there these are the smallest portions i have ever seen i wouldnt fred my baby with such small portions and im a 158 lbs guy .
what a nice surprise outstanding service staff makes you feel welcome good food at reasonable prices .
this place came recommended by several people but i found the food to be mediocre at best the concept is great the service was great but the food was disappointing .
always fresh homemade fast service all soups are very hearty and full of flavor the pierogi is freshly made daily and sells out quickly once i bought over a dozen packages for friends at work during holidays everyone loved them .
one star is too much for this place bad service expensive and baby plates .
good food but slightly oily pho spring rolls are amazing area is not good to go at night .
its all about the bread is there motto and thats especially true with there sandwiches mostly bread lacking in the meat cheese and toppings department .
ive only tried a few things but their summer rolls are much better than any other vietnamese restaurant in jersey city by far prices are great theyre fast too .
one word overrated i dont understand why this was one of the top rated restaurants in yelp philadelphia the bread is crusty and hard and the sandwiches are just passable ive had much better at planet hoagie or even quiznos definitely not a repeat place for me .
i quite enjoy the chicken and vegetable sandwich hits the spot for 3 75 i live for the avocado milk shakes .
white trash hawaiian food that totally sux chic spam and wonder bread the sexy waiters are absolutely the only reason to go and the spam of course .
amazing view i love l i c they actually sail around manhattan i had great time on our trip i do not have any information about this trip yet i guess they recently start to doing this it wad very worthy .
used to eat here all the time the place has gone down hill however the icing on the cake is the 90 minute wait to get my food delivered .
bison burger is the best meat option here chevapi not even close to the real thing .
i ordered the mamas gyro it was very dry woman next to me sent it back for more sauce with hardly any filling but meat i didnt feel it was worth 5 will not go back .
this place is a hidden gem in lic right by the water and great view of manhattan its a great spot to grab a burger and beer it took us a little while to find this place but its totally worth it .
update they did end up giving us a refund .
this place is great its what lic used to be before all the freaking yuppies moved in its not fancy and thats why i love it .
been coming here almost 2 years today i had a mama salad and found a fly in it wish i was around the store when i started eating it so i can call the health department i will never come here again .
love this place great little chill spot right on the water to relax and have some beers with a great view of the city cant wait to go back soon and often wish they took credits cards though that was a bit of a drag .
dolmades from a can poor customer service dry chicken gyro really just pieces of chicken dont order from there .
sweet little chill place on the water food isnt great but the drinks are a good value .
i went back after a year and found this place sadly changed for the worse increased prices kept same quantity but decreased quality food was mostly bland with not much of a flavor for that price youd expect more sad .
great burgers and sausages on the grill beer wine and view prices are high for the food as you would expect with outdoor waterfront place beer and wine prices reasonable very much worth it .
tried it again for lunch last week the place was quieter and less crowded and rushed got the greek salad and grilled shrimp it was tasty but shortly after lunch i got violently ill im done with this place ugh .
good food great view nice place to go if you want a low key night out it is a cash only spot the only atm in walking distance is in the 23 blocks down .
service was terrible rude and rushed us through .
the secret is out now and people finally fill this space in the weekends weekdays is a different story calm quiet charming low key and discrete great serbian style bbq nice cold beers and very friendly owners great views of manhattan whats not to like .
overpriced food chicken kebab was dry and flavorless the restaurant wasnt even busy but the waiter made us feel pressured to hurry up and leave overall it wasnt worth coming here .
one of my favorite places in nyc they keep it simple bottles of beer dude on the grill never too crowded killer view of mid town sit right next to the water dogs hangin out basically as close as you can get to chillin on the black sea .
there is a deal in restaurant com but they dont accept this deal big portion poor quality i am definitely not coming back there are better options near by .
this is the best kept secret in nyc the beer is inexpensive and cold the food simple yet well executed and the city view is unbeatable great for the weekend afternoon that you are stuck in the city and dont want to be surrounded by 6000 people outdoors .
like the margaritas that is about all too commercial for me .
love the decor nice atmosphere good food very friendly staff slim pickings in woodbridge so i think this place adds a nice touch bar style food with a little twist lots of comfort foods on the menu looking forward to going there again .
disgusting food poor service never again please .
good little family owned diner good food including some different treats like seasonal pumpkin pancakeswaffles very friendly service not open on sundays .
on the go order was horrible i paid 7 00 for an appetizer sized guacamole that was a 12 cup portion and the chips were stale i order this all the time from the neshaminy pa location and am quite satisfied there this location sucks beware .
i have been going here with my kids since it opened years ago our favorites are the fried egg sandwiches burgers and grilled cheese sandwiches friendly service .
a weak attempt at mexican food the chips have an artificial processed texture the rice has butter on it ew the margaritas are ok a little too sweet i had the fajitas they were ok a good place to take young kids but not for real mexican food .
the pressed cordon bleu sandwich and chili cheese fries was on point some random charles bronson on the tele also was a real kick the decor had some serious time to it .
pros excellent margaritas the food is decent and consistent between visits cons quality of service is unpredictable and sloooooow bathrooms are often unacceptable avoid them at all costs in short i do occasionally enjoy otb especially when i know they wont be busy .
i have to limit myself to stopping in here only 2x a week i love these bagels .
chipotle burritos are better this fake sf style burrito sucks .
good sandwiches fresh bagels veggies and other fillers worth the price .
i ordered 3 tacos mahi mahi which had good flavor but tiny l and in addition two chorizo tacos that looked and tasted just like ground beef ive had plenty of chorizo and this wasnt it again tiny tiny tacos that simply didnt deliver .
best bagels ive had in a while i got a special with eggs avocado bean salsa cheddar cheese and pico amazing also took home a bakers dozen n some olive pimento cream cheese oh and the berry smoothies are fantastic too i wish i lived closer .
its a direct chipotle knockoff with fewer options period .
went in today for lunch staff was friendly as usual during my visits bagels were flavorful and had plenty of cream cheese they got us through the line quick my fiancé who previously didnt care for bbb said today everything was very good .
these are americanized tacos for americans that are not lookin for taqueria style tacos they serve tacos with shredded cheddar cheese sour cream and salsa lol need i say more i mean food is food but authentic tacos these are not .
prices are awesome tried a 3 smoothie and their bagels are always so yummy .
carnitas was very tender the burrito though is very salty with the mild salsa it was almost uneatable ask to try the different salsa before you put it on yours .
as a bagel snob i have to say they arent half bad pleasant surprise in vermont we also had some tuna pasta salad stuff which was very good also .
chipotle is far more better than this place this place had no veggies to go in my burrito even the rice was overcooked overall bland food vegetarians please stick to chipotle it is complete value for money .
my goto bagel shop .
overrated and crowded think one small step above chipoltle if you want good authentic mexican tacos this is not the best place to go .
awesome some of the best bagels i have had freshly made nice and soft and chewy .
might as well have been chipotle except chipotle is better very disappointed highly americanized mexican food and i couldnt stop farting afterwards .
they make an excellent plain bagel very soft and doughy inside the pumpkin bagels in the fall are so good you pine for them all year i miss this place .
yeesh what the hell are these people doing it aint burritos .
they have the best pizza around the buffalo chicken pizza they offer is the bomb ive never had bad service and they always seem to be open late .
there are no vegetarian options because the rice is made with chicken stock boo .
brooklyns pizza is sincerely the best pizzas i have eaten so many varieties its amazing they dont only have pizza the array of things on the menu is simply amazing great service and very accommodating i simply love this place .
i just dont get how this place can survive when there is chipotle the food they make in dos toros is tasteless in the best case its not even spicy and it looks kind of trashy why are you ppl go there in such an excitement .
they won me over .
i dont get the hype its just another chipotle everything tastes boring from the salsa to the rice to the meats .
ive had pizza from everywhere theres is the best i even ate in once and everyone there was so nice love this place .
man is this place overrated .
they have been open only 3 weeks so i think some things are growing pains good reuben friendly staff ok atmospheredecor need to replace outside carpet .
tasted like a bunch of ingredients that was boiled and stick together the very hot sauce wasnt that spicy either .
rather tired an institution that needs a refresh or call it quits .
for vegans there is nothing in here superboring and blend burritos or tacos there is a lot of better choices out there awful .
great food great service great wine selection perfect for a date highly recommended to the max .
gummy tortilla .
great restaurant great bar great kitchen great boss one of my favorite restaurant in nyc .
are you kidding me an hour line for a chipotle rip off i dont think so run away and spend your hard earned money at one of the nearby food trucks the only positive is that the place serves pacifico .
4 5 stars this place is surprisingly good find here through yelp because its close to penn station mussels and shrimps are good will definitely come back .
decent nothing special to be honest for the price id rather get chipotle it seems zestier do people still use the term zesty although im northeast born and raised so maybe i just dont get californiastyle burritos still doesnt seem like its worth the hype .
lovely french ambience this is very close to fit everyone was very sweet helpful the food was very good we had one of the brunch items and tapas great variety to choose from fresh tasty and exquisite presentation definitely recommend .
way too expensive for what it is selections are terrible food was ok chipotle was better sadly .
exceptional food and service reminiscent of a visit to france three delicious french beers on tap and plenty of wine choices excellent small plate of risotto and excellent mussels great space in a hideaway spot .
dead and gone .
the nicest wait staff around risotto to die for only wish theyd been around when my office was around the corner id have taken a time share on a table love this place .
the rice is not vegetarian so i ended up with a rather meager bean burrito it tasted good but i dont think it was worth 6 50 after tax .
great french bistro with a funky vibe highly recommend sitting at the bar with eli the consummate mixologist friendly sharp like anthony bourdain in his prime fun time great food cannot go wrong enjoy .
one of the coowners of this place was in third eye blind for a minute which is maybe the reason he is so weird yeah the absence of vegetarian and vegan options is bull and the blatant ripoff of calexico is embarrassing avoid .
wow this place is so phenomenal with a dedicated team work tasty french cuisine makes ocabanon unique and my favorite is the chocolate saucisson hummm so yummy you guys gotta go there and its near the msg .
no thanks .
great service and a wonderful cocktail list cest délicieux the bartender amanda is very attentive and makes a good drink i highly recommend this establishment .
sooo disappointing nothing like a san francisco mission taqueria this is on par with chipotle but at least chipotle uses niman ranch pork dos toros says nothing about the source of their pork or beef just their chickens .
cool little spot nice folks buratta and tomato salad tasty kebab of sausage in pita and mussels were enjoyed a most pleasant alternative to all the bar food places near msg .
chicken stock in the rice come on guys if you were really so california youd be better to your vegetarian customers oh wait maybe you dont have any my mistake in coming to your restaurant .
the perfect spot for a girls afterwork drinks ive tried their business lunch as well it was not bad the portions are small but delicious .
it tastes like chipotle to me its not bad but i wouldnt go out of my way to eat here .
great french food fresh menu for summer .
presumably the founders have had a few burritos in california how is just copying that so difficult this is nothing like the real thing sorry the cheese was sliced the sour cream had the consistency of water the salsa was just bad .
my new french crush for quality quantity atmosphere and pocketbook no passport required for a france excursion and if lucky to meet owners ask them about their journey sure to make you an instafan .
it is no better and no worse than chipotle meh .
nice quiet vibe with delicious food and tasty beer i had the mushroom risotto with truffle oil and parmesan delicious served with fresh and fluffy sourdough .
i have only had a breakfast sandwich from buis and frankly i am not impressed the sausage egg and cheese is way better at hemos .
very nice neighborhood restaurant and very french indeed our food was fresh and imaginative and the service was very friendly the back dining room is a bit hohum and a bit claustrophobic very generous by the glass wine pours we will certainly return .
overall the experience was good waitress was very nice attentive and funny the food was alright we actually enjoyed the nachos more than anything .
this place was quiet delicious and upscale with no nasty attitude a friend and i shared the salad lyonnaise and a charcuterie plate that were both stunning .
i wasnt really excited from the food service is pretty bad i wouldnt suggest it .
i really like this place so wonderful to have a quiet wine spot like this in the neighborhood nice waitstaff delicious terrine goodsized portions and of course a really lovely selection of wines the ambiance is great as well .
the butcher bar was not that great the ribs were very fatty with not much meat mac and cheese taste like it came from kraft and sweet tea was not sweet waitress was not attentive .
contrary to your belief the food is actually pretty tasty im not sure how sanitary the place is because we got delivery .
byob is great the portions not so much the burnt ends were delicious the salad with carved turkey was pretty good too however the ribs were a bit too dry as was the complimentary apple cake but its complimentary .
mes rêves has become my goto restaurant in the area have never had an experience there that was not firstrate .
average food but highly overpriced for the quality .
this place was great everything from the mussels appetizer to the duck entree to the bread pudding dessert its also a byob so a nice way to save some money i will definitely be back .
service and good could definitely been better the restaurant had a lot of potential and was not close to what you can get in texas .
my wife and i had a great dinner tonight my wife had the escargot appetizer and lamb entree while i had the musscles and salmon i won on both accounts dont forget its a byob .
the brisket was dried .
absolutely delicious with wonderful service and a great ambiance a hidden gem .
i dont know what it is with this place but it seems they cannot deliver in less than an hour and the food is cold when it arrives we have tried 56 times and this has been the case each time too bad .
really great meal here with my parents had the seared sea scallop appetizer and the sauteed skate everything was good tried some of my dads escargot also on point mom pop were pleased nice restaurant great decor good service would come back .
the brisket was very dry and not much of the smokiness really came through burnt ends were ok sides were decent and the pork belly was very good love the concept but ive had better for less .
i love that there is a french place in bloomfield the service was great and the food was delicious get the skate .
dry turkey dry brisket even after asking for the fattiestmoistest they had the sides were the only highlight of the meal would be open to giving them another shot but not very optimistic .
went there 3 times and always great the owners are just the nicest people in the world the food is great and the choc soufflé is worth the trop .
for their prices id expect the best steak of my life i did not get it never going back their menuprices are insulting .
service 2 5 took forever to get our souffles food 3 54 ambiance 4 5 location 3 overall experience 4 talented chef .
i was looking forward to visiting this steakhouse but the experience was mediocre at best the steak was okay but the price was ridiculous there was no real reason to return i would go back if they halved their prices .
very good french food really tastes french i am french maybe a little old fashioned i will go back .
loud and overpriced the food is good but the horrific atmosphere and elevated prices makes this place not enjoyable a huge disappointment from a restaurant group that has much promise .
last night was my third time here i love this place the food and service are always amazing save room for the pistachio chocolate creme brûlée i dream about this dessert five star service food and atmosphere .
your typical mall asian fast food wouldnt really even call it thai food theres like 3 places in this food court that all have the same food .
wow awesome classic french food in bloomfield service is spoton and the food keeps true to the pure flavors that make french food so good everything weve had so far has been great especially good was the duck lamb and steak pretty affordable and its byob too .
the waiter was bland the food was incredibly oversalted and bland the dan dan noodles were good maybe ill try a hot pot in the future appears to be the most popular dish i used to really like it here oh well .
ive been here for dinner and will definitely be going back a good atmosphere a terrific staff and i give the food a two thumbs up baristanet com201102m… .
tasteless and bland wonton soup no bok choy cabbage or roast pork pieces mushy skins and tasteless filling very disappointed .
im in love with this place the ackee and salt fish with fried dumplings are on point .
the place is noisy and the food stinks nuff said .
the real deal goat curry delicious cant wait to try everything on the menu .
so overpriced and bland duck dumplings could have been filled with anything duck was not distinctive we had a beef dish that was tender but not special at all the waitstaff was nice but clueless serves me right for trying to get chinese food outside of chinatown .
weve only ordered delivery from this place so ive never seen the interior but the jerk chicken and curry chicken are amazing i think im addicted .
the food tried to hard to be original and ended up over priced and disappointing wont go back .
best patties ever so freshly prepared yummy oxtails are delicious as well so glad i found them .
i was here a few weeks ago food was great 1 star for charging 11 for a shot of root an entire bottle is around 30 in a state store other stuff from the bar seemed priced a little higher than normal but still reasonable 11 seems excessive .
the food here was amazing the dine in service was good and the cashier waitress was respectable and very pleasant .
food was decent nothing spectacular but what got me was that they automatically add 18 tip to all checks thats every assumptions for a restaurant also a reason to keep me from going back .
this place have the best oxtail and jerk chicken i have ever had and they also deliver .
the stars are only for the convenience and hours ordered delivery of grub hub and they forgot my garlic knots and the pizza and wings were cold the food was nothing to talk about and not something i would seek out .
this place has good pizza i tried the philly cheesesteak pizza and t was good perfect with a little but of ketchup too they also have many other types of slices i cant wait to try others .
not really a place i would return actually didnt even finish the sandwich i ordered this is not a pizza place not even close more of a sandwich and middleeastern food shop sadly it could be much better prices are reasonable .
great crispy crust i recommend for a quick slice tuscan pizza was quite good great variety of different pies .
dirty dirty dirty place bugs in ketchup bottle dirt and grease every where needs a good cleaning .
handsdown the best pizza in the area ive tried them all and the quality is always consistent the slices are huge and always juicy the chicken parm sandwich is also huge and delicious pizza night at my house every friday with friends always consists of puzos pizza .
october 2014 visit my sandwich came with fixins melted in on top of sandwich and fixins were not listed on menu and that ruined the sandwich for me prices were reasonable .
didnt disappoint at all i got the baked ziti mom and dad got a meatball parm everything was good and definitely will come back overall experience was great so that deserves a 5 star .
the mediterranean sandwich is just lettuce and tomatoes with a sprinkle of feta on a doughy bread absolutely tasteless .
really good slices in out typical jersey strip mall alongside busy 46 west in beautiful fairfield clean dining area and friendly counter service you can sit in the back for table service too good alternative to the other shops in the same spot sushi chinese deli bagel dd .
i have eaten here before and the food is good its just a bit pricy the soup is very good also the presentation of the sandwich was lacking save a couple bucks and go to red robin in the same parking lot .
good pizza great chicken parmesan sandwich .
they call that breakfast .
my favorite pizza place in the area always have a big variety of special pizzas by the slice .
tasteless greasy fortune cookies were excellent .
amazing their custom pizzas by the slice were heaven to my taste buds i had three slices with the following on top 1 cheese tortellinis 2 chicken parmegian sp yes with hunks of chicken 3 buffalo chicken need i say more .
tastes very similar to solo the other skewer place located at 10th st over priced compared to solo i would consider giving this place another try since its relatively new place however i prefer red kings bbq because its more flavorful and tasty .
a fantastic evening and delicious meal the staff was fun friendly and knowledgable we especially enjoyed the heirloom tomato salad and deconstructed carrot cake well definitely repeat .
sat at the bar for drinks i was treated like dirt service was horrible never going back .
while driving all over new england heading to maine we had dinner reservations at the inn at weathersfield the restaurant is rustic and quaint the food was very good the staff was very friendly too .
the food is kind of boring the ingredients dont stand out for freshness and so i always come away feeling meh bar service is very good .
wanna bring a friend in for a birthday dinner anything could help me out with a reservation pleaseeeee appreciate .
good food but crazy that their catering van driver is criminally aggressive a block and a half from the restaurant would think they might realize they are trying to kill their own prospective customers .
had tasting menu the value beater the hell out of its price it was not easy to get a table though called 3 weeks in advance for 2 ppl at friday night still we sat at bar make sure you call exact 30 days before .
service was slow and not attentive food was less than par and the beer selection was lacking went for a good dinner received an inedible meal half cooked and over seasoned not a good meal .
big fan of bohemian its in my neighborhood and never knew it even existed until a friend referred me the tuna poke had me in love after the first bite and i am forever changed the drinks are equally delicious cant wait to come back here .
extremely slow i ordered paper dosa for take out and was told 15 minutes 30 minutes later still no food very unhappy with the service .
their food is great good taste and fresh the environment is a little intimidating tho .
not a place for vegetarians went there with friends who love that place and eat nonveg to try their veg biryani wasnt available ordered roti and mushroom curry somehow felt like they use the same oil that was my first and last time to this place .
i dream about this place .
had a lot of expectations before visitig here for lunch had biriyanis and it was sub par and the gravy items arent great reconsider before going here not at all same as the one in chennai .
good soups .
this is only a review of the dessert i ordered macaroon was awful super hard and dry seemed days old way overpriced as well .
i dont know where to start bohemian is definitely among the best restaurants in nyc service food ambiance all top notch prices are high but not crazy 50person excluding drinks .
mediocre deli food large portions not so great meats nice pickle bar .
very exclusive dining experience and the tasting menu is worth to try love their yuzu panna cotta .
i didnt have high expectations at sushi buffet place but serving rolls with half cooked rice is really pushing it very disappointed at the food the service was lack luster as well they clearly didnt want to be there either that or its the food they just ate .
food was amazing service was impeccable i will definitely be dining here again ごちそう様でした！ .
the food is so bad there the salmon and squid they use has been frozen for a long time i had a serious stomach ache after having lunch there do not go there it sucks .
really really nice restaurant really nice get anything you will be impressed the foie gras sushi was a definite standout but is was all really really good giraffe friendly .
sushi sashimi and roll was just ok tom yam soup has nothing in common with a real one the service was ridiculously slow on not too crowded evening kid was waiting for icecream more than 20 mins no masa anymore will go to hon or mizu .
what a place what a hidden jam we went there with our friends and shared all the meals in order to try as much as possible no disappointments at all great food great service highly recommend .
horrible service first our appetizer was cold and they forgot our gyoza second they lost our sushi order after almost waiting for an hour we even came early around 530 pm to avoid the saturday rush sorry never been so disappointed .
everything was amazing order the uni croquette and fried sweet potatoes those were my two favorites the cocktails were so delish im planning to come back really soon .
tried to go there but their policy has recently changed to only allow hotel guests and people meeting them there in starting at 4 pm .
order mac 5 cheese best thing in the menu foie gras soba sliders mediocre short rib sashimi caviar rice branzino setting quiet unpretentious great for catching up convo tip check out the butcher by the front door .
many many open tables but i was told there is a 4560 minute wait at 4pm on a friday dont they know who i am .
such a surprising and cozy place services were great and food were great too froei gras soba is amazing .
nomad hotel male bartenders not the library bar waitresses 1 guy in particular are the most arrogant stuck up bartenders ive come across nyc excessive attitude seem like a crop of frustrated 30yr hipsters .
wagyu beef and substitute with japanese yam 5 stars nuff said .
not even a one star very bad if u want the real thing go to the paesano in girard ave simple the best .
make a reservation early and arrive on time food is made with great care using fresh ingredients and interesting combinations slow down enjoy the atmosphere which feels a little like an indoor garden scene from a murakami novel really delicious unique mealorder a variety and eat it familystyle .
just went today and was very disappointed went to paesanos because of the food channel and now i would never take there word again .
the food and the service both excellent truly felt like i was in japan having dinner what i love about this place besides the food and service is the relaxed atmosphere and cozy seating this become easily one of my favorite japanese restaurant in downtown .
overrated and the one on girard was better had the lasagna sandwich and the long hots overpowered everything on it dissapointed but not surprised attitude at owners other restaurant modo mio is dissappointing as well .
orgasmic raw short rib and the foie gras soba was insane .
this place is closed and not at this location .
i love the feel of this restaurant what a cool atmosphere drinks were great food was really good definitely get the three highlights uni croquette short rib sashimi and foie gras soba best of all price wasnt bad loved that part so refreshing .
radio bean is nice server with glasses is annoying .
food 4 service 4 the topsecret japanese speakeasy in the past is now like a w hotel lounge the food quality remains great liked the burgers the whole fish portion is surprisingly generous .
went there tonight with my family rating 1 to 10 1poor 10excellent food 4 atmosphere 2 service 1 never again there is enough much better not difficult italian restaurant around .
this is one of the best meals i ever had it was intimate so go with your significant other not like me who went with a guy buddy we were the only ones not on a date foi gras soba was awesome and branzini was awesome .
the dinner is way too fatty the service is terrible it is expensive and overpriced it gets two stars because they do make one of the largest pancakes on the planet .
a pretty unusually designed restaurant with a great fusion menu a wonderful option for a quiet dinner or date space is limited so dont come here with a big group i highly recommend the sliders and the sashimi .
this place is a dateruiner the inexperienced servers will test your patience its a shame because we liked the food .
well it used to be a secret but i guess no more this place is one of my favs so many reasons .
decent french fare uneven kitchen not very consistent mediocre staff lovely decor including wood burning stove in rear other better options in this part of brooklyn .
great food more a mixture of stuff than japanese .
i had a steak with garlic mashed potatoes an hour later i had diarrhea thanks but no thanks .
what an amazing place very chill atmosphere excellent dishes great bar cocktails could not have been a better experience thank you jessica we had a great time .
good food terrible service we were ignored for quite a while when we first sat down when our order was finally taken the waitress seemed annoyed that she had to wait on us very unfriendly vibe here food was ok but not worth the rude service .
dined here 31012 this was a wonderful treat i loved the mystery of the place which mad this an adventure drinks were wonderful and the bronzini was the best i hav ever had crispy on the outside and wonderfully moist on the inside the uni croqauette was delicious .
i recommend this place for brunch and maybe a sandwich for lunch but for dinner you can do better for the same price .
im a fan fo sure i didnt do the tasting menu i took some yelpers advice on not doing it and just ordering stuff i might like instead i love the atmosphere cannot get enough of it .
dinner here on a sunday night a few weeks ago large birthday party for one of my friends the food was great but the place was empty and still the service was terrible they ignored us and everything took forever as in four hours for three courses .
i actually went back a week later .
i ordered the house burger the bun with burnt and beef under cooked no seasoning below average burger plenty of better options .
heres what we had and everything was so memorable and so so beautifully presented mint gold manhattan drinks were very good citrus shiitake mushroom salad amazing flavor and great combination bohemian mini burger uni croquette sashimi platter salty caramel ice cream .
pros tasty juicy burger and grilled cheese on the late night bar menu cons found a light colored hair in my burger that i mentioned to the waiter and all he did was take the hair from my hand .
ask for the meat menu trust no really just do it .
picked this place for brunch over resto because of our bad experience with anything with less than 4 stars the waitress attitude was that our requests were an imposition the food was good but nothing to write home about .
interesting hidden locale with mid century decor and seating which is somewhat uncomfortable for a dinner delish food offerings .
the worst chinese food i have ever tasted we ordered pork fried rice and coconut chicken for take out and had it delivered we took a few bites and had to throw the rest away and make something else it was absolutely disgusting and inedible .
my favorite restaurant amazing service and food .
typical greasyspoon chineseamerican takeout prices are low and food is passable but not outstanding interior is rather dismal id recommend takeout in a pinch .
cozy atmosphere attentive service really good food one of the best places i have dined in nyc .
for american this place is really nice but for vietnamese like me the food is not authentic if you want true vietnamese food that might not suit the american taste dont go here .
very good for two mushroom salad fondue uni croquettes rib sashimi risotto foie gras soba the coffee is something else only drawback i love mid century modern sofas but they are not comfortable to eat in .
the food is good but on the very pricy side for vietnamese watch out the bill it will run you 70 after tips for lunch easily .
awesome uni croquette oysters foei gras soba good uni salmon roe sweet potato creme brulee bleh branzino huge portion not bad for the price but tasted like a normal piece of grilled fish at any restaurant american taste was plain etc .
food is decent but over priced staff is rude if you want delivery be prepared to wait 2 hrs .
you get 3 hours for a dinner reservation and the food is great my favorites were the mushroom salad foie gras soba and the shortrib sashimi definitely try the shortrib sashimi my friend and i ordered 3 servings because it was so good .
pho was pretty salty and from the get go three main menu items were not available they dont even make banh mi anymore what gives pretty disappointing wah .
baffling that i failed to review this after my visit there last year wonderful uni bowl short rib sashimi chef made me feel like a long lost friend yes yes go see the toilet .
too expensive .
one of my alltime favorites get the prefix with the sliders and start with the veggie crudo thing love yum delicious .
the food was just meh i was expecting more since everyone was raving about how amazeballs the veitnamese food was .
very small full of character and so intricately thought out that it feels like the owners hobby rather than their business beautiful miniatured japanese garden i could eat here everyday taste 810 presentation 55 creativity 45 wine selection 45 total 2125 .
food is ok typical vietnamese nothing too special 2 stars due to they serve in really small portions and a bit pricey too .
best japanese food ever not sure how traditional it is but the food is amazing the secret is out so dont think you are some memeber of a club by scoring a rezzie here just go with your most pretentious boots and prepare to be disarmed .
they removed the pho bo from the menu and replaced it with a water based broth with chicken nasty bring back the pho bo .
the real deal be sure to have the branzini which was on the tasting menu wow also they have a good whiskey selection including yamazaki 18 which was a big for me .
overrated good people watching though .
the fusion food menu and most of the dishes are interesting enough though not the best in taste but outstanding in concept and presentation very good to have it in the neighborhood with its hidden location the indoor miniature garden however we appreciate their effort look pretty dead .
dont believe the hype i didnt think the pizza here was all that great i had the square slice maybe i just dont get it the spumoni ice cream was just aaight maybe the sit down food is better .
solid four star restaurant and bar the food is beautiful the drinks are clever and the interior space has that micro indoor garden theme nice place for a drink or intimate dinner for two meat fish and vegetarian meals available .
i dont know why everyone loves this place this pizza is good for bensonhurst but if you are willing to make the trips a lot of other places are better 1 lombardis 2 di faras 3 grimaldis .
i just cant find them sometimes .
over rated but fun for a visit and people watching .
not too heavy great icing we like the coconut and the mounds the best friendly service .
just okay i dont get the hype the red sauce was bland and the noise level what with the tables so close was off the charts .
this truck always seems to park itself by my work or home i like the oreo cupcakes i usually have to purchase the cookies from the bakery location .
honestly have experienced such better square slices in brooklyn than here but has a great atmoshpere .
excellent cupcakes .
i do not see the hype over this place the pizza was ehh spumoni i can definitely live without .
love them great novelty pricey buy yummy .
i ate here yesterday seeing they had a b rating i didnt mind it because they have a good reputation the next morning i wake up not feeling well turns out i got food poisoning and had to leave work dont think ill be going back ever .
chicken and waffles with bloody marys very delicious the service was awesome the bloodys are ok but the chicken and waffles were insane i will be back shortly for more chicken and waffles .
the square slices are too saucy and the round slices are nothing special .
silk has been one of the best vibes in the city great djs on the weekends and a creative and broad menu mark b has done a great job with the place .
this place is 40 yrs past its prime over priced pizza it was good back in the 70s not now .
went here on a date after a recommendation from a friend the hostess was a bit daff but the rest of the staff was on point leslie the bartenderserver was great and very friendly everything we had was delicious and perfectly cooked .
nothing special i tried the square slice the regular slice i tried the parmasan sandwiches and nothing special theres are so many good place around brooklyn .
this place is always good i went here recently for brunch and had a delicious mediterranean omlette which i ate out in the garden even the coffee was delicious i have been here for lunch and the food is always tasty i also like the funky decor .
sorry excuse for an italian restaurant try papa leones in manhattan beach instead .
if youre a fan of fried green tomatoes get here early they go quickly .
never in my life has a place made me feel unwanted in their restaurant another hispanic family walked out after sitting for 15 min and not even water was brought out to them smh never coming back .
had a great time beer selection was great wings were awesome staff was very friendly and helpful during the entire stay .
seriously whats the big deal with this place ive been here twice had the pizza and thought meh .
i came here for brunch with my boo and it was absolutely amazing service food drinks and atmosphere were all perfection it was nice to see a manager so involved great job guys .
not a fan i dont see what all the hype is about sorry .
dinner is good not amazing however brunch is fantastic i wake up on the weekends craving their chicken and waffles i love the chicken and waffles chicken and waffles here are so good did i mention they have chicken and waffles .
i hadnt been here in a few years and was pretty excited to go i was not pleasantly surprised place was dirty and the wait staff was horrible the pasta we ordered was completely over done pizza was still good though .
what a great outdoor brunch service was spot on she had the sensational lemon ricotta pancakes wstrawberry rhubarb compote i had the tasty and savory bees breakfast burrito waitress was cheerful and we were not at all rushed the result of our experience we can has brunch perfection .
its doughy with bland sauce and tasteless cheese it just cant compete with the other pizza institutions patsys tottono artichoke etc on a positive note its cheap and quick .
decided to get chicken and waffles from here but wasnt too satisfied with it my friend got the shrimp burger and i ended up eating half of it it was amazing .
i was very happy to try the sicilian pizza here but it was nothing special the highlight of my visit here was their spumoni it was very delicious their pastas here were also quite delicious so you can give that a try .
amazing food we was satisfied with everything that came out above all the presentation was spectacular for a diner and key notes to make for the biscuits and sausage gravy and the drenched chicken and waffles not a place to sleep on .
i used to really love the pizza here obviously something has changed i ordered a half tray and to my surprise the outside was totally burnt and somehow the middle was raw the pie was all sauce and no mozzarella whats up with all the grated cheese gross .
everything is good here great prices great shrimp burger best fries everything is made fresh to order and with a little bit of bang .
very crowded waitied a long time to be seated noise level was incredible food was decent we were a party of 9 and we had to wait for our food individually instead of being served together i do not plan to be back .
we came to this place to pregame before going to soundgarden i also got an order of the wings pretty good good spot to come and pregame drinks are relatively cheap and service is good .
pizza is mediocre i think they live off their reputation people just follow what theyre told know what u want square or round next no toppings canned soda outdoor seating limited indoor seating havent eaten in restaurant part though .
food is great and love the dancing that goes on in the other side id def eat here again .
you ever had pizza back in elementary school lunch the kind that comes in a pad looking shape yea thats what the sicilian slice here tasted like cookies and cream icy was not bad though .
everything ive had here is great awesome hard cider on a cold nice is delicious funky atmosphere can get a bit weird late at night during some dj sets but hey thats philadelphia .
this pizza sucks no trace of mozzarella their round has cardboard crust dont bother .
party party party i love thursdays at this spot its a mixed crowd with dj sylo and mostly urbanmusic its 5 for guys free for girls only problem is waiting in line to use the bathroom .
lousy people working there no parking there run away from this place dangerous area .
i dont even like potatoes but the french fries here are legggiiit always good food kinda slow service but im never in a rush when i go here .
when i was a teenager this was the place to go for the best square slice in town in my opinion they arent as good as they use to be the quality of their pizza went down hill the dough is soggy and undercooked .
best fried chicken you will ever have the entire buttermilk fried chicken entree is excellent thanks to guy fieri for the recommendation on ddd .
overrated appetizer is bland dining entrance has uninviting smell service however is nice and accommodating overrated appetizer is bland dining entrance has uninviting smell service however is nice and accommodating .
went there for brunch and had awesome smoked salmon benedict and the best bloody mary ive ever had i think they add horseradish .
its called spumoni gardens the spumoni is the best anywhere the pizza never understood the hype or the lines lived in brooklyn over 40 years any corner pizza shop served better pizza if you want a better pie before your spumoni head over to totonno or lucali .
had dinner here with my daughter i had the rueben sandwich which was very good the fries that came with were excellent i sampled my daughters macaroni ad cheese and it was delish great service ate outside on a nice fall evening .
its average pizza at best i cant believe the plaudits this place receives however the rainbow spumoni was awesome this is not pilgrimage pizza you need not make it a priority to get here .
great specials not bad service get the empanada appaetizer well worth the drive from jersey .
i am underwhelmed its overpriced far away too much hype first time i wrote such a short review very disappointed only good thing about it was the guy who took me here hes hot heeheh that is why i gave it at least two stars .
oh man really hip little joint good food love the vibe probably best for groups of 24 and not at all busy for a late dinner during the week looking forward to my next trip back to philly to enjoy another meal here .
overpriced overrated and over crowded and the pizza isnt really that good .
went for brunch always a fun menu great staff and good food fab drinks patio is open and a great place for a little fun in the sun .
i dont get it the regular slices here are terrible mushy and cold the square pie it ok but i have had way better the sauce is way too sweet .
only been here at night the place is always full of dancing and fun .
this review is based on customer service at the pizza counter not the restaurant ever since the real owners sold the business to a bunch of these guys are horrible nasty attitudes .
great brunch spot had the chicken and waffles per a friends recommendation and it didnt disappoint .
i only have one word overrated thats all its over rated over sauced bland pizza with too long of a wait .
lounge is good for the sundae parties .
if you ever wondered what heinz ketchup on soggy dough tastes like get a square from lb its just nasty im a native new yorker and id rather eat ellios than eat at lb .
loved it will definitely be returning .
loud music the place got on my nerves staff is rude and the owner is so full of himself .
currently dancing my labor day wkend awayyyy hey silk city .
dont go out of your way only if you live right i mean right next door guess im spoiled by brooklyn cant give 12 star .
i go here all the time food is fresh and consistent staff is great and they seem to have little turnover which keeps things familiar fantastic outdoor area when weather permits and its a pretty cool night spot its got it all .
i was disappointed by this restaurant the dishes were salty and it took a long time before they came out we ordered the green curry and phat see ew we also ordered dessert which was only mediocre .
the food is rich wholesome and delicious albeit slightly too salty .
food is great atmosphere is great service is medium horrible and the card machine stopped working while we were here nobodies fault but you could have let us know what was happening so that we werent at the table waiting forever for our check .
one more reason to love silk city their shrimp and grits is soooooo goood .
waiter r no nice because i am asian you thinking i will give you bad tip the way look me like that let me tell you i always give more than 30tips you miss it enjoy the 1 tip for give me a water .
after living here for 10 years finally made it silk city fried chicken eggs benedict cider hash shrimp and grits need i go on i left happy and will be back .
its just pizza ok but not wow like any other pizza joint .
menu is creative and food is amazing casual great for brunch after a crazy night and will have enough money even with the insane bar tab from night before .
blah terrible you shouldnt go there totally kidding its as amazing as everyone else has written just wish people would stop heaping praise on it so i could get a table once in a while .
big heaping portions huge outdoor area friendly service cool decor what more could you ask for ive only been here for brunch and have only had to wait more than five minutes once great neighborhood gem .
very rude staff overpriced pizza was all crust with very little stuff on it would not recommend .
this place is really cool the atmosphere is great i really enjoyed the music and dancing the dj was really good and mostly played mj and other old school dance music although it was crowded on a saturday night it did not feel overwhelmingly so .
i can only speak for the pizza since i ordered take out the price of a pie is extremely expensive 24 and the taste is not so good not worthed .
i can really only comment about thursday night at this place it always to seems to draw a good crowd and has good music the diner is amazing i rate it 5 stars due to taste and convience overall it is a 4 5 start venue .
service was terrible .
love love love this place great food great service and the owner is awesome always enjoy a trip here .
really bad management of seating people very annoying waiters too .
been here a couple if times there is outdoor seating when weather permits expect comfort food fusion and you will find something to eat parking is metered on spring garden enjoy .
the worst of the worst of what brooklyn has to offer all hype and bad attitude awful .
love the outdoor patio seating hubby had the burger and i had absolutely delis shrimp bisque followed by appetizer fish tacos which was plenty the beer selection is outstanding cannot wait to go back service was friendly and quick .
entirely hype and kind of a bad joke the pizza differs little if at all from any of several hundred other slightly upscale pizzerias in nyc yes its cozy and intimate and yes its hard to get in this is not the recipe for tasty pizza however .
really fun place good food music awesome drinks i really recommend going i love the look and feel of this restaurant .
lucali lose the attitude folks if you want to wait outside for hours to be served regular ny style pizza by bitchy waitresses then this is the place for you otherwise dont waste your time and money not worth the trip .
great place to eat at been a few different times and every time i def have the thai glazed wings great desserts and burgers too only knock is them not having bigger screens for the eagles games .
overrated pizza good but not as amazing as everybody says cheese was very tasty but crust was way overdried 1 5 hour wait and 28 for margarita pizza that is way hyped up .
my philly omelet was good and service was quick and friendly had no idea however that metered street parking would be this expensive in philly ouch .
overrated i really dont get the hype difaras continues to be the best in brooklyn in my opinion has been for almost a decade now certainly not worth the wait even though its local i dont even bother .
they are really stepping their game up in terms of the brunch options here recently loved the shrimp grits crabcakesalmon benedict keep up the good work silk .
its certainly good pizza but not worth the wait go to sams where there will never be a wait and the pizza is just as good if not better .
i love the silk city salad and the cheese fries are to diefor the staff is awesome and the music there at night is great .
not that good much better italian in the city staff was a disgrace food subpar only plus byob .
nice for brunch i hear the lines get long great servers .
last time i ate here the food was way oversalted also its over priced for what you get they need to lower the prices or give you a little more my check is always a little like what where did we go tonight im still in nutley .
different not your traditional diner food but a little pricyer .
bugs on bugs on bugs in my pho tai and a stink bug my friends bu luc lac beef cubes manager did not handle situation professionally and did not offer an apology for the foods never going there again .
favorite place to dance in the city food is pretty good too .
worst pho i ever had 80 water hardly any meat or noodles dont recommend .
the place just works on either side of the front door what i know and love is the diner and now the outdoor garden consistently wonderful .
i went there two weeks ago on sunday noon there were not much customers over there we ordered summer roll and one beef combo pho both of them are not impressed to me the store is located in nutley downtown area the price is reasonable service is fine .
good little wait but we expected that it is sunday after all .
decidedly mediocre id go back if i was driving by and desperately hungry certainly would not recommend .
another place my daughter saw on ddd funky place pretty easy to find parking food was good and service was pleasant went once for brunch and once for dinner outside dining is nice also .
ok vietnam fare nothing special nothing special .
diner and lounge now youre speakin my language a great spot to catch the dj spinning dance your ss off and vibe the vibe what could be better a diner next door to end the evening with a fresh tasty bite .
i am quite disappointed about this restaurant the service was bad i waited for more than 50 minutes and my food was still not ready the restaurant was not even that busy perhaps the kitchen was not in sych with the front desk i gave up .
didnt have any food there but got plenty of drinks from an awesome asian bartender one thursday with my friend im not a dancer but the music selection was alright too mostly old school 80searly 2000s hip hop rb and remixes .
i feel like this place is hit or miss this weekend it was a real miss food was not hot and wings were swimming in sauce kind of gross .
its hard to beat a summer night on the patio with good company the dinner menu is woohoo .
not a good effort by the staff and kitchen tonight been many times this was not a good showing drinks were fine food was not very good .
this place is the bomb diggs a diner with an outside patio and music venueclub attached i mean cmon also the food is dammn good .
cute interior but unfortunately that was the best thing about the place mediocre food choices hardly any gluten free options and absolutely abysmal service when there was hardly anyone else in the place never again .
wonderful surprise strong beer selection wings were exceptional would definitely go again not a traditional diner type food and that is a compliment .
this is a great looking place that could be really successful if they got a decent cook a shame to waste an interior like this in a town that has nothing else just doesnt make any sense .
super old school a city landmark good music and a diner connected what more could you ask for .
a nice place with nice servers but the service was a little slow and the food was extremely underseasoned a shame since its so close to where i live .
best mac cheese they actually have really great food for what seems to be a diner connected to a dance party i also enjoy the wings tuna sandwich sushi grade what up .
ordered soup and salad for lunch got a tinnie tiny cup of soup and a straight out of the bag salad for 13 just insane i was still hungry when i left and i am not a big eater way too overpriced for mediocre food .
great cassolet .
not good we waited forever to get served the food was expensive with tiny portions and the service was very poor if your just going to have drinks it looks like thats the way to go i wont be going back .
great food great atmosphere great service best bartenders in the city sammy slice tuphace ftw .
i think many of us in glen ridge would like this place better if the bartenders had some personality and were a bit friendlier just sayin .
name me a single other restaurant where you can get steak and eggs with grated truffles truffle vinaigrette for 14 im still waiting .
food service mediocre way too noisy .
been going here for years specials are usually the best meatloaf is great too great music and cool decor can get crowded but worth the wait .
awful service food came out tainted with plastic and spoiled ceasar dressing on different occassions never going back owner didnt care and was put off by the fact we were upset .
good food always good music monday night for back 2 basics w king britt or sundays for reset never a bad time here always super fun friendly people that are there to have a good time .
horrible hostess staff super condescending and unhelpful very disappointing must be a heavy weight on the business .
love this spot i pretty sure its vegan friendly lots of good drinks music desserts .
arrogant waiter and small portions .
consistently good beer delicous food and good service in a cool casual setting love the outdoor seating .
if only if they tried less on presentation an more on quality it would be a food place the chef should come to miami and have some cooking classes from the cubans the service was good .
this is a great place one of my favorite places to go in philadelphia .
save the 85 so you dont have to be malnourished plus the waitress compared to the raw egg that came on a spoon you will leave hungry .
one of my favorite spots for sure food is consistenly amazing as well as the service the garden area was extremely well thought out and executed good work keep it up .
you should not go during peak hour the tapas i had yesterday was overpower by salt and the food was not delicious at all .
loved it i was in town for a girls weekend and this place was so fun great dj so fun to dance cheap beers very crowded though .
very average meal nothing was bad but nothing was exceptional had shrimp scallops crab stuffed poblano chorizo wild mushrooms i really think i could make better myself or at least as good .
very good cocktails fun goodlooking crowd and amazing food when you want to pay the money .
seriousely not that good .
drinks good dancing good brunch amazing wait for brunch not as amazing two blocks away excellent .
good wasnt bad service wasnt bad either but wasnt pro level forgot to bring our drinks then more several times i have to leave 2 stars but not more .
favorite place to go dance for some reason i just have to drink a crappy miller high life while im there its just the atmopshere ive never been to the diner side because im normally to buzy dancing .
i thought this restaurant was overrated definately does not live up to the hype food is fine just not as spectacular as people said ambience is also lame tables for two about as small as a newspaper dont get all the fuss .
we came here with a group of 30 after a birthday party deejay dj did not dissappoint my brother is somewhere between chris brown and michael jackson for all time best dancer and the dance floor provided adequate space for him to show off his moves .
i was unimpressed our waitress was not attentive and made is feel like we were an inconvenience the food was forgettable i will return to give it a second chance since everyone else seems to have had a great experience .
love the atmosphere the djs the vibe the drinks the food the bartenders the people my favorite dance spot .
wow shockingly overrated spent about 150 a pop and was very disappointed everything was either bland or underwhelming nothing special and a big waste of money maybe it was an off day .
greaaaat breakfast spot i went here before it changed hands so i dont know if its still good stuff .
ive been to amada many times over the year i would say it is one of the best tapas however with my recent dinner visit i got a major stomach flu which im still recovering 4 days i may have to think about going back again .
i love silk city this is a staple in philadelphia the food is only trumped by the awesome atmosphere of a 50s diner that can only be found in philadelphia .
the food doesnt suck but the service level does its the only restaurantbar that ive ever ever walked out of twice cool layout and design but i wouldnt go back for a 3rd try .
silk city diner was amazing it is one of the first places i went to when i came to philadelphia it made me feel right at home and all of the food was phenomenal man i miss it .
great ambiance but food was sub par yelp reviews looked good so i was surprised by the quality .
oh how i miss thee let me count the ways .
very cute rustic place food is average at best soft undercooked pretzels that we had to wait for 25 minutes bland mushroom tart with arugula good selection of wines and beers ok service plenty of better places in alphabet city .
i really love this place ive never sat inside and mostly just get takeout but their food is always fabulous and homey definitely recommend .
awful we had mixed vegetables and chicken and eggplant in garlic sauce they must have dropped the salt shaker in the food never again .
we have only dined in the restaurant area fodd is outstanding and comes out hot service is wonderful always they never rush you byob .
dont know whats going on there the quality is going down considering how expensive the food is .
good pizza .
my husband almost choked on a piece of plastic while eating some lo mein makes we wonder about cleanliness of this place .
grandma pizza is awesome .
ive been ordering from here for years its been worth the extra cost because the food has been superior the last few times ive been disappointed though the spices have been off everything is bland even dishes labeled spicy tonight my tangerine beef was also very tough .
this was a great restaurant that we found thanks to yelp the food was outstanding the people great and the portions huge recommended .
this is chinese food for people who dont know any better very average food with the usual suspects on the menu if you want true authentic chinese go to chengdu 1 on route 23 next to staples that is the real deal .
love this place i always get the oysters brunch is wonderful and i get something new for dinner each time can be chilly in the cold monthsbut maybe the heater wasnt working that day .
the rudest woman answers the phone she is driving business away if she is not the owner they should definitely fire her they are losing business because of her food was nothing special so why bother .
brunch review say yes to the french press coffee steak and eggs mexican breakfast plate the ambiance is great for twos fours and six and kidfriendly service is fantastic .
disgusting dangerous my wife and i are both at the hospital with food poisoning after eating at this death trap eat at your own risk to make matters worse the food was revolting i would rather die than eat here again .
great oyster specials for happy hour wide selection in oysters the lengua was good as well the menu changes from time to time keeping it fresh .
the drinks were overpriced and the bartenders repertoire of drinks was extremely limited .
very tasty and elegant the other reviews are right just back from lunch yum yum .
18 00 for two breakfast sandwiches and a coffee really it it was processed crap not worth it would have rathered a mcdonalds then this .
we have been coming here for almost 2 years and everything we have tried has been amazing i really recommend it .
first of all this is in terminal c not b second dont eat here staff was nice but i had some very questionable chicken in my sandwich yuck .
the food was incredible highly recommend the french toast mac n cheese and pancakes the only reason i left one star off was due to service little slow that should def not detour you though this place is a must .
the most blend expensive insignificant sandwich ever and personnel is a bit rude too stay away from this .
we ate dinner here on a sunday night the food was unusual and delicious the atmosphere was very comfortable and attractive the service was outstanding .
the customer service was ridiculous the employees knew nothing about the menu and made a simple transaction super tedious the food was toooo greasy and not what i expected theres room for growth though .
yum yum yum this is my favorite spot for brunch in the slope they even have seating outside for those nice summer days they tacos are excellent and by far my favorite .
stopped in today and tried a blt grilled cheese not enough cheese the bread was greasy and served in a cardboard boat the price for the sandwich was over seven dollars not worth it .
one of the best omelets french one on the menu i have ever had the french press was also great in fact the butter for the bread was great the service was outstanding as well i am def coming back soon .
meh food was okay an alternative to our usual repertoire colors in space are obnoxious space is too big for the amount of people that were actually there really would love it if they switched locations with red eye .
very very good food strongly recommended to everyone who is around everything was very fresh and super tasty plus very polite service one of my fav place in this neighborhood .
while the service was great the food was incredibly bland very disappointed with my visit and i would not recommend it you could get better mac and cheese from velveeta .
came here for brunch and loved it the food and drinks are great i highly recommend coming on a beautiful day to use their back patiogarden area inside has a cool vibe as well will definitely be a regular brunch spot .
first night wuz good second night def not bland sloppy disappointed .
great brunch place nice latin inspired creations attentive service pleasantly surprised by complimentary buttermilk biscuit prosciutto and mole sauce aperitif rustic decor with cool ambiance sinatra and louis armstrong overhead highly recommend .
i have been here before and loved it beware though that yelp says it is open when it is not call first .
great service staff is very friendly food was well presented and tasty the scallops with polenta were ok but not amazing the scallops were a bit too fishy for me .
the food is on the oilier side but i buy from here only because they deliver .
went here for valentines day brunch delicious food great service our waiter brought us a free bread pudding sample courtesy of the kitchen our coffee came in individual french presses fresh squeezed grape fruit juice will definitely return next time im in brooklyn .
this place is totally not worth the wait seriously the food is no big deal and the staff is rude the lady in charge of seating is not professional at all and favors certain customers over others save the frustration and spend your money elsewhere .
excellent brunch scrambled eggs were soft and made to perfection definitely order a side of their corn millcrusted bacon yummy service was great staff was super friendly owner was there and very hospitable .
worst service ever almost killed my friend who as food allergy shame on u and ur unprofessional staff .
great brunch friendly wait staff good environment .
hated it the seafood was extremely fishy including the shrimps the chicken kabob was chewy and u only get dessert if u come early enough in the day dont waste your time .
visited for brunch the french press coffee alone is worth it small busy with exceptional food expect to wait but you wont regret it .
greasy and over cooked lines are forever but the place gave me indigestion both times i went better place next door .
beautiful space delicious food the sauce on the chilaquiles is so good its hard not to come here every weekend for brunch .
i dont understand what the fuss is about this place is mediocre at best the food was pretty bland had to salt everything the only thing that was outstanding was the octopus for good greek food there are much better choices in astoria like mp and agnandi .
great atmosphere great breakfast delicious french press overall great experience they lost one star for price prices seem extremely high for breakfast 17 for a breakfast sandwich is just ridiculous .
bad customer service large greek salad is smaller than the small salad no seasoning for the fried calamari .
outdoor seating awesome brunch menu and homemade belinis .
save your time and your money subpar food and service .
great coffee perfect eggs baked beans that sing .
cash only tip so because theyre greek they dont have to play by the same rules as other restaurants food is good though at times somewhat plain andor heavy definitely overrated by zagat .
super delicious brunchy goodness ive been here twice and would go back again i highly recommend this spot .
according reviews from yelp my boyfriend and i went there yesterday and i am so disappointed i order fillet of sole and fish was so taste my boyfriend order greek style burger and meat was dry .
fantastic very well thought out dishes subtle flavors high quality ingredients and very good service reasonably priced i will definitely be going back there .
pretty good greek food .
had breakfast and it was awesome great service overall very friendly staff tasty food ambience highly recommended .
food is deelish but htey seriously treat you like po0p here the service is horrible they should take reservations and they always let their own kind skip their not own kind but i am definitely used to that being from astoria sorry but its the truth .
decor is so lovely grain salad delicious this would be a nice place to come with group of friends or on a date .
good food but too much arrogance on the ordering front so much sniping from the front desk i would love some understanding .
the mexican egg sandwich is excellent this place also has cool family kitchen vibe which makes it nice on a sunday morning like having brunch at a friends place .
be prepared to wait an hour for mediocre food and really poor service make it two if youre not a greek male .
good food good service good environment the food is wholesome and well seasoned i have been coming here for 34 years now and i i have always had a good dining experience here .
if deep fried fish in lard is good food then i guess the reviews make sense terrible food its the mcdonalds of greek food .
oysters and wine are amazing .
i do not understand why people adore this place the fish is not amazing nor particularly fresh the service is horrible the tables are too close and the locale is too loud there are both better fish orand greek places in astoria .
amazing from start to finish nice bright space an amuse bouche to start delicious coffee incredible flavor melodies long list of specialty oysters and to die for desert presentation top notch yes ill be back .
im turned off by the owner writing a review of hisher own bar nobody in their right mind would write a review that extensive hence the owner writing the review .
the best brunch around nice staff a perfect place order anything its all good .
made my coworker sick from tuna at lunch decor is average bathrooms were messy .
i was there few months back with my girlfriend and the food and service of this place are amazing and the owner of the place was very very nice .
food was extremely subpar for the price slow unattentive service .
absolutely perfect for outdoor brunch great french press coffee and menu selections recommend the pork belly which my friend and i split i had the chicken salad which was interesting owner is really nice chatted with us for a while overall highly recommend for brunch with friends .
food and service were ok but nothing to write home about .
one of my favorites in the neighborhood i love the egg sandwich on the brioche everything at this place tastes so fresh and the ingredients are top notch .
meh it was okay youve got so many better options in philly i wouldnt worry about checking out this one .
wow without words just go youve got to go went for dinner now extremely curious about their brunch kind of pricey but every bite is worth the money great for a romantic date .
sorry yelpers i placed this review for the wrong location my review is supposed to be for the 134 w broadway new york ny 10013 bt duane st thomas st in tribeca restaurant ive never benn to this location .
probably the best service ive ever had at a restaurant we felt like we were guests in their home the food was creative flavorful and quality definitely on our short list for park slope .
bland mussels mariniere service was meh indifferent .
great brunch spot fresh food and good service .
shit coffee and the owner is a dick was pissed with me when he didnt know what a breve latte meant sandwich was ok .
i love this place the food the service both outstanding one of my favorites in parkslope you will not be disappointed .
docking them a star because despite knowing they have terrible service i keep coming back to be dismayed at their terrible service if only they could swap the staff at this location with their e 20th street location .
love their brunch loved lengua y papas my husband loved his huevos rancheros their coffee is very good also .
hostess has no idea what she should do have been waiting for an hour and saw people after us are getting seated .
great brunch spot really cute tastefully decorated space with a menu thats diverse yet knowing in its strengths our server was a little awkward we had to ask for a few common sense basics cream with my coffee please but ill definitely be back .
not only did the place smell like cat pee was louder than any other place ive been to had weird waiters and bad coffee but i managed to sit on a piece of gum that ruined my pants gosh .
incredible food service and ambiance the roasted garlic they serve everyone to start is the best and the veg tacos amazing gorgeous outside patio highly recommend .
wait really tiny portions and totally overpriced ok fine the waffle is pretty good but its tiny as f the lobster omelette was the special for that day it was aiiiite nothing exciting .
ive eaten here a handful of times great food wine atmosphere super friendly staff did i mention the food is great ps pork belly ftw .
panders shamelessly to the manhattan brunch crowd with sweet greasy obvious dishes like croque monsieur and nutella baguette nothing french about this place except the mediocre service .
one of my favorite places for both brunch and dinner i agree with other reviewers about the attentive service and delicious food went for valentines dinner last year and we are already talking about making plans for next february .
food was ok went for brunch however i didnt find the place very clean wont go back .
thefood is really good there too bad they dont serve espresso i also like the decor need to go back and check if service and prices deserve 5 stars .
i used to like it here for dinner for brunch its so cute but the last time i was there i saw some roaches crawling around so i cant be going here anymore .
really cute place and unlike most of the other reviewers i came here for dinner the service was wonderful everyone was friendly and helpful the food was great really well made and fresh i really was super satisfied with the whole experience and would happily come back .
meh i had a prosciutto and mozzarella baguette sandwich there was barely any prosciutto and the baguette was soo difficult to eat i was literally fighting with it i had to gnaw and rip through the bread like an animal ill have to try something else here .
the tacos were fresh and delicious the veg platter was flavorful and inventive i cant complain about a restaurant that caters to vegan palates with ease and commitment to quality .
weve been to acacia twice and its always terrible i cant understand how this place gets 5 star reviews the food overpriced and lacks taste the service is average and restaurant needed cleaning .
the best olives wed ever had coriander kind of a sweet taste underneath that good sardines pork juicy and bright a marmalade made out of something id never heard ofyuzu bread pudding with vanilla and lots of cardamon also good roasted capers woah .
this place was not a good restaurant there was a weird smell at my table the steak was okay and the chicken was terrible byob is the only plus to this place .
best brunch in park slope hands down amazing coffee local and sustainable ingredients and fresh juices the service is always friendly especially the manager its a warm atmosphere with delicious food not to miss .
wanted a special meal that did not happen way over priced the room was nothing special without a reservation felt like a second class citizen the fly did not help the situation will not return .
this was our second visit and the staff has consistently been friendly and courteous the twist of flavors always takes us by surprise the laid back attitude and atmosphere allowed us to enjoy our long brunch with no rush truly a gem in the neighborhood .
its not for everyone .
love love love watermelon juice straight up and chilled delish this place makes me feel like we are in a beach town having a vacation kind of brunch what doesnt sound good about that .
great beer decor and food but this women bartender whos great at what she does has the worst attitude doesnt care that youre staring at her and waiting for your bill after having asked for it twice place wasnt even that busy check your issues at the door .
fresh delicious food great service casual but refined atmosphere byob fantastic prix fix highly recommend .
this bar sucked first off where does a bar when asked for bacardi do they tell the customer this isnt a rum bar its a whiskey bar second when do you ever see a bar being cleaned with bleach while patrons are still inside .
my favorite restaurant in the slope they care about everything from the incredibly delicious scrambled eggs to the lovely honey for tea they know how to do everything well and with elegance .
seriously this is what you think the area needs no thanks uncomfortable seating draught menu on some screen i couldnt read train station atmosphere .
ive never had better mexican food in the us definitely what i miss most from the year i lived in littlefield someone please send me a j .
seafood very salty n not fresh never again .
good food best in town i recommend that you come to this family restaurant if you are in the area .
the problem here is the service it has been the problem since day one and is still the problem no matter what you order it takes forever you can order a beer here walk to christys drink a beer walk back here and still wait for your beer .
i like this place a lot they treat you like family here very respectful to the customers that come here the pizza is very good and not a thick crust you can eat a slice of pizza while watching a football or baseball game here .
got to the pub around 1030pm on st paddys day no fucking irish music absolute fucking bullshit .
probably the best bar pie ive ever had great atmosphere waitress was a little inattentive .
i like the more traditional irish bar setting ordered the shep pie should be a no brainer it was greasy mentioned it to the bartender didnt seem to care kinda shrugged it off .
friendly large neighborhood place excellent fried chicken great cheese steak good staff .
theyre just ok pizza is actually way too expensive though .
the new park tavern has been around for many many years located across the tracks in e rutherford opens early and closes late great food and good drinks lots of tvs and plenty of sport channels on without the big prices .
actually no stars not good there are a ton of great pizzas in the area ordered sausage counted only 6 strips on pie not good people are nice there but im paying for good pizza .
best pizza around theres a large bar up front a nice size restaurant in the back have never been disappointed with anything ive gotten there price is good for the area .
just a sloppy pie try sams giant pizza on stuyvesant ave lyndhurst great pie .
great pizza great antipasto platter and the drinks are stiff only downside is sometimes it gets too crowded and noisy but hey its a barrestaurant .
ive eaten here several times as its one of the only indian food options in hanover the food is always hit or miss my only suggestion is not to go when they open during that time food is never fresh just reheated from the morning .
great family restaurant or late night spot to hang out and grab a drink excellent pizza and outstanding mussels my dads favorite place in the world .
we drove to this place for dinner from north of white mountains for some 80 miles for the fall season the restaurant was quite busy dal makhani was average chilli paneer was a little sweet and not what chilli paneer you would think of naans were good .
this place is great fun atmosphere not ridiculously crowded good music people etc the pizza is delicious service was pretty good too .
they need to fix there gps location landed in someones backyard hope they can fix this soon .
amazing thin crust pizza huge salads cheap and strong drinks the loss of the star is for the weekend crowd and some of the dodgy locals but the service is friendly and most food great .
disappointing i was excited to try this place but my takeout was barely edible curry was bland and soupy naan was charred and all the food was cold best part was the homemade chutneys and perfect rice bottom line temper your expectations for this costume jewel .
great place for pizza and mussels the stuffed artichoke was a disappointment bar area is big an a lot of locals plenty of seating in the dinning area .
the entree of chicken tikka masala was okay but all the items on the veggie platter appetizer were refried to the point were they were dripping with oil the samosa literally had oil drops falling out of the interior .
my girlfriend got me into this place great pizza drink prices are nice and the atmosphere is good .
pricy because its the only indian place in town their breads are especially ridiculously priced and not even cooked properly i think i cook better indian food any day .
my favorite spot been going here for years friendly staff great pizza love the mussels and mozzarella sticks .
used to be a regular at the jewel the food tasted very good and authentic two of us got sicker than pigs one time and ive never been back .
great food love their pizza the thin crust is delicious they also make a great eggplant parm parking is a little annoying but good besides that .
hubby i have been here maybe 3 times once for the sunday brunch buffet the food is soso and although it is a nice change in cuisine style it does feel somewhat overpriced .
i luv their small pies i lived in brklyn across from grimaldis i also worked in a pizza parlor as a kid a good thin crust crispy pie .
the pizza was tasty and service was freindly but my husband and i dont think it worth 36 for one pizza with two toppings the special toppings are 6 to 8 bucks each we are not going back .
ice cold beer and great food what more do you need to know .
smells bad and while the owner is awesome the food isnt american as i thought it wold be .
pretty good place pizza is great steaks are large and beer cold problem service sucks .
i wouldnt recommend this place at all really bad service and dirty inside towards the end of the evening plates were left on tables and the kitchen was a mess .
this pizza is da bomb it just is we were in jersey this weekend and had to get our pt fix it is consistently good and crispy the way it should be check out the new park tavern which in reality is about 75 years young .
service was great salads were good you should stop there soup was salty adding cheese mde it saltier sauce on pasta was terrible its ashamed because they have homemade pasta sauce was not good on any entree do not recommend .
awesome pizza strong drinks giant bar what more do you need lol .
was not impressed at all the tomatoes for the caprese salad looked and tasted like they came from a can the entrees were subpar .
great place to go for a beer and an awesome thin crust pizza great service bring the family and sit in the back or go and hang with friends in the front bar either way it will be a fun tasty night .
only ate here once and had adana sandwich it was fairly flavorless unlike my beloved efes also the rest of their menu seemed very expensive will consider giving them a second chance maybe .
i suggest sitting in the back i like the pizza the gennaro steak sandwich and the artichokes .
it says on there website in bold we deliver that is wrong they dont called to place an order for delivery on four different occasions and every time the answer was sorry we cant deliver why advertise it in the first place then .
had yankee roll and mountain roll both were delicious .
i dnt like servise and workers are terrible .
it was recommended by a friend and we came here for lunch it was good price for the portion i ordered the lunch box had a piece of salmon fried rice salad and soup the salmon was fresh and it was well cooked .
somewhat bland food atmosphere is nice though .
fresh sushi that was made to order the sashimi came in generous slices the bento box was really filling and was definitely worth 20 the service was somewhat slow but i really cant complain because they were busy and everything was being prepared fresh worth the wait .
went there with high expectations started off well until my wife discovered sharp tiny bones in her burger manager refused to allow us to pay thankfully no injury done but really dont know how they manage their quality .
favorite sushi place good variety in offerings nice creative rolls and always fresh .
decent but dark ambiance great drink selection but extremely crappy food i ordered a flatbread pizza it was served cold and the mozzarella was hard it was as if they took some bread put sauce and cheese on it and never put it in an oven disgusting .
decent and average sushi place miso soup seemed a bit salty compared to other sushi joints but sushi was fresh veggie fried rice was a bit oily service was good and quick .
came here for happy hour with my co workers the vibe was wack the food and happy hour drinks were good there was a good variety of happy hour drinks wasnt fun tho so we moved on to another spot .
great sushi seaweed salad was good too sushi delivery amazing delivered over on the promise quoted 35 minutes was at hotel door in 25 minutes .
its like taking a trip to 2010 it boldly labels itself a gastropub serves chipotle aioli and blasts miike snow and passion pit maybe ill be a bit more nostalgic for those days in a few years but right now it just seems like this bar got stuck .
i like the rice here a lot the fish is good not standout but certainly not bad i think fu sha is generally better but this place is a little closer to my house and so gets my business quite a bit .
no phone number found on the yelp listing so we couldnt make a reservation when we arrived there was a 50minute wait we went elsewhere to eat .
one of my favorite places i never order from the menu instead i ask them to pick 3 rolls of their choice and each time it turns to be a delicious surprise definitely recommend this place to all sushi lovers .
closed replaced by sidewalk cafe which seems to be a considerable improvement .
my husband and i went here for sushi one evening we were very happy with the food and service the prices were great as well we will be coming back for sure .
dont get the appeal so many other places r better .
good but more expensive for me and my high school friends .
i have given this place a couple of opportunites to redeem itself but it turns out to be the worst hot dog place in nj .
great location friendly owners and great tasting pizza cant wait to go back soon .
this resturant includes japnese chongqing sichun shanghai and hunan cuisines so you can know there is no cooker could be an experter as four cuisines in one restarant i wont come back again btw the waitress looks like lazy and unprofessional .
i tackled the homemade meatball sandwich twas up to par super tasty the small was big enough for me the large would barely fit in my trunk ill definitely hit this place up again .
a huge thumbs down on the sushi it was like eating a bar of margarine .
just order it today and im writing a review the same day just because is amazing wow perfect pizza i just became a regular .
over 45 min to get sashimi i didnt get it but when i finally ate a piece i got it it was still icy cold ew obviously not fresh sushi just frozen grossness .
rarely do you have a supreme pizza that is still very much crispy not noticeably soggy at all when you take it home superb craftsmanship .
i would have been really happy but my chicken was undercooked on the inside id definitely try mood cafe it is worth it but just beware of undercooked meat everything else we ordered came out well done .
best pizza i can get within atleast 20 miles good prices too .
my first time ordering i am not a fan of the crab rangoon not sure what they stuffed them with it surely was not cream cheese not sure if ill order from here again or not .
ive been going there since 1983 when their first location was in rutgers plaza i believe its one the best pizza out there i can eat their pizza everyday its a little tricky to find .
it does get good points for decor but food is really salty in this place saltier than any chinese joint pad thai is straight from a box you can make a better one than what they make .
great food great service great view .
huge portions soup blows fish was good service is practically nonexistent we are sitting and waiting for a waitress most of the time and the sauces are in the bags touch of fast food .
i love this place nice location great food great drinks .
lunch menu was extremely limited i went with the pad thai as it is a simple dish and usually consistent among different restaurants the pad thai was tasteless and worse not even warm i actually feel a little unwell now .
a nice casual restaurant with a fantastic view of the lake prices are reasonable and serving sizes plentiful the food was fresh and tasted great service was accommodating without being overbearing would definitely come here again .
i dont understand the reviews for this place personally i had a simple spicy noodle and chicken dish that was in edible it was soggy cold and flavorless i would never eat here again yuck .
good food and service decent prices .
first time eating thai so i didnt know what to expect what i did find was an overpriced lunch special with not enough protein in the dish utter disappointment honestly .
i tried the seafood marinara it was so good decent prices and the food is good also a nice view of the lake .
didnt like service poor gave us food without utensils when we asked it took us asking 3 t imes serve serve appetizers in baskets didnt give us dish .
chill and yummy i like the atmosphere perfect for dining after a long work day the waiter explained every dish cant go wrong with the polenta .
this food made me physically ill the chicken and noodle dish i ordered was a hot entree but when brought to the table nothing was hot it was almost warm never again .
very busy tonight especially for a tuesday service suffered a little but the food is worth the wait broccoli rabi appetizer is always good but the new addition brussels sprouts was delish but esp for honey lovers oxtail ragu pasta was very good as well .
found this very lackluster and not worthy of the hype rolls and tacos were just ok its def one of the fancier asian fusion spots versus an actual japanese restaurant just ok food not worth the and a long long wait .
loud but fun and funky atmosphere .
in short the fish is not fresh when i pointed this out to the waiter he just shrugged i definitely would not come back .
highly recommend calling head to see if seating available the steak tartar potato bravas and oysters are a must .
this was very disappointing food i came for the brunch and was told it was good food very disappointed with the eggs benedict it came out cold ashame because i wanted it to be good .
love this place the oysters salumi and broccoli rabe were all great the patatas bravas are just ridiculously good and service is excellent .
move on there are better choices on restaurant row food was overcooked slow to come out from the kitchen service is fine one of those places where you say to yourself i could have made this better at home and i dont even cook .
i had a good experience here good wine not gonna write a whole storybook about it .
terrible new waitress made silly and expensive mistakes that we ended up having to pay for the dishes were portioned and over cooked completely different from our last dining experience disappointing all around .
one of the most lovely old fashions ive had in a while the ambience is nice too it was a fun place to be with my friends from boston .
food was just okay but the service was incredibly slow and rude we got shuffled between floors a couple of times and once we were finally seated our wait really didnt seem to want us to be there .
this place is great for sunday brunch quiet and relaxing great food at reasonable prices definitely one of my favorite brunch locations in brooklyn .
loved the atmosphere great server the food was ordinary upstairs bar way cool .
the food here is great and the service is fabulous the creamy polenta melted me ill make this my weekly go to spot the hunky italian bartender is to die for ill see you guys soon dev dev xoxo .
completely thrown by how bad a place with 4 stars was i had to we just had pasta beef sliders and tiramisu all were bad .
seriously delicious food fantastic service and staff and a great vibe ive been two or three times try their frozen espresso creme brulee you wont regret it .
we didnt stay after waiting a while for the waiter in addition to the smell of cleaning products it didnt seem worth the time or money to actually have a meal .
the chefs tasting menu is also superb ask for the polenta the best desert ive had in my life worth coming to brooklyn especially for the lemon tart with strawberry and rhubarb compote and macadamia streusel at saint austere grand street brooklyn divine 61914 .
i enjoyed the shrimp positano but not enough to go back the service was lacking the waitress forgot not only a beer but the entire meal of one of our party i dont think hell go back either .
delicious food amazing happy hour prices on both food and drink sweet friendly brothersister duo opened the place and both make an effort to keep customers happy i am a major foodie and would recommend coming to this cozy cute yummy spot .
this is a charming little place to eat at nice to sit and look around the food was o k ive definitely had better i was a bit disappointed i went for dinner so maybe this place is better for drinks and appetizers .
great food amazing prices during happy hour service is phenomenal family run cozy atmosphere .
looked adorable got good yelp reviews but quite frankly didnt deliver both our meals short ribs and ravioli were awful and inedible our waiter was very colorful and entertaining he was the best part of the experience here .
the food is ridiculously good great meatballs and 1 oyster happy hour cmon and the staff is extremely knowledgable when it comes to the wine selection its definitely my goto spot in williamsburg .
ok its not bad its a tiny charming place with prompt friendly service but it really does taste like something you could make at home i am not convinced that was fresh broccoli and was that vigo spanish rice .
the service here is amazing i can only speak for the oysters which were deliciously fresh and briny ill be back for sure .
drinks are great homemade potato chips are delicious but the pasta is bland and tasteless its pretty hard to screw up pasta with cream sauce and bacon but they somehow managed .
broccoli rabe and polenta were absolutely delicious plus 1 dollar oyster happy hour from 6 to 8 honestly worth the trip over .
i went in there and bought a bag of burgers for my family none of us liked them they were greasy and the bread was stale .
delicious everything we had was amazing every person that worked there was extremely helpful and nice the food was out of this world cant wait to come back .
we purchased a living social for lil burgers and decided to try it out the sliders are really really bad tastes like white castle though they are trying to be trendy the buns are cheap tasting and the meat barely qualifies as meat will not be back .
each dish was thought out and executed with tremendous care end result was an awesome meal i had a fantastic eating experience with my friends hanger steak and tiramisu were the winners .
i was super excited about getting truffle fries but they were out i would have expected them to have everything in stock and be more consistent with their products however what i got was good still dissapointed about not getting the truffle fries though .
superb could not say enough about st austere delicious fantastic wine pairings and such a good value for williamsburg highly recommended do the tasting menu with wines its easily worth the money .
way overpriced and at the location i went to on 6th ave in ny some of the employees were pretty confused slow and forgot to put in my order .
been here twice and i fing love it everything ive had has literally been outstanding warm butternut squash salad polenta meatballs pappardelle and so on my only complaint is that all the food is very rich even the salad .
ordered some grilled tacos got them fried instead small portions high prices they go mostly for style you will leave hungry and unsatisfied .
amazing small plates innovative takes on classic dishes every dish we tried on the tasting menu was superb .
ive had better fish tacos at panda express and would rather eat at the taco bell in penn station than return here .
ive been here twice and both times the food was delicious the place is tiny so there is usually a wait so be prepared but they take your phone number down and will give you a call when the table is ready .
if you go to a lowbrow pizza place like sals and order anything other than pizza youre in for a bad time im pretty sure the penne vodka has bologna in it .
we enjoyed everything we ordered the octopus the bone marrow the polenta the fried artichoke and cant forget shavings of fried garlic the cauliflower and tuna we will be back .
food quality has gone down at this place i hope it gets better as not many good diners around anymore this place used to be much better than park west diner but now i would say they are about the same in terms of food quality .
love this place great happy hour oysters the steak as well as the polenta are fantastic .
owner refused to let me use the restroom until i sat down and made an order the food was terrible on top of this .
excellent food and great service 35 price fix with an additional 20 wine pairing what could be bad did was great and filling .
waitress was terrible as was the food when i sent back the platter of hummus and vegetables the waitress was bitchy about it would not recommend .
amazing everything was delicious the polenta was otherworldly and wine was exceptional they also play hip hop im not sure what could be better dont let the small size fool you definitely worth a visit .
rude employees .
a must for a nice dinner and yummy oysters and coctails .
absolutely disgusting like everything in philly the vomit covered portapotty outside the establishment is cleaner .
great food great service the owners appreciate their regulars and newcomers equally get the pork or duck ragu and of course the polenta .
maybe i am the only one with awful service if a drunk college bar is your vibe you might enjoy just dont expect attentive and friendly service .
started with terrific 1 oysters and segwayed into the 35 tasting menu the whole meal was delicious particularly the polenta the bronzino with caponata and the partially frozen tiramisu dessert the food was exceptional by far one of the best meals ive had in north brooklyn .
mediocre pub atmosphere with no redeeming qualities and incredibly rude staff there are much better neighborhood pub options nearby .
great great little place 1 oysters happy hour is hard to beat really friendly staff and good service would recommend to anyone i just went for the first time but ill certainly be coming back often .
just dont go trust me .
the tapas were hearty and divine had the polenta broccoli rabe cavatelli pork belly croquetas and grilled octopus the only complaint i have is that i couldnt taste the pork belly in the croquetas i will definitely be back .
mcgillans uses their dumbwaiter to transport food and garbage between floors after i saw that ill never eat there again .
everything i have tried on the menu is amazing so savory and prepared with care the staff are super nice and they have an amazing wine selection my favorite quiet spot .
sunday afternoon postcenter city shopping was the perfect time to stop in for a pitcher of cold 1860 the house special brew plenty of space good snack food and friendly service whats not to like .
best things about sa great cheese plate nice bartender reasonable prices on good tapas good selection of beer spirits sherry and goat cheese dollar oysters very cheap tasting menu i cant wait to go back .
mcgillins yeah more like mcguyisland nothing but dudes in here fucking place sucks .
if you like small plates this place is great very reasonably priced 5 plates and a bottle of prosecco100 bucks not bad at all great staff we will be back .
i dont get the attraction to this place it smells like an old wash rag the food is all fried and limp the place is loud even at lunch time and the wait staff is grumpy and i love nostalgia i love irish pubs but this place ew .
youre too good to not be open for sunday date night .
my credit card number was stolen and used at this place not cool someone on the inside is in on this .
amazing staff is always warm and friendly and very knowledgable great wine great good i live a few blocks away and will def be back many many times .
bartender couldnt pour a proper guinness .
holy creamy polenta this place is so awesome .
this place looks like a kindergarden kids probably 12 years old are working here and they dont know what the heck they are doing food was good and service was good as well at least they were trying but still not really happy .
the owners are just wonderful the food is delicious the atmosphere is cozy and inviting saint austere is a lovely neighborhood joint where we always are taken great care of .
i came here with my girlfriend and waited longer than 1 hour for them to bring out a couple of omelettes very dissatisfied with the service here and would never come back again .
absolutely delicious what a surprise its not cheap but then who asked us to drink 40 worth of beer one complaint other tables around us got the patatas bravas on the housebut not us wonder why we definitely racked up over 100 .
donuts are greasy they also have a traveling donut truck and they are not reliable .
lived up to all the positive reviews loved it .
huge but too sweet for my taste this place has a restaurant inside .
delicious food and friendly service a bit slow but most dishes were worth it stick with short rib and pork belly skip octopus and bone marrow .
probably under rating it but i ordered the breakfast bowl it has has browns i asked for well done hah browns these were barely warm and white there was 4 people in the place so it was not a time issue .
great deal during happy hour owner is awesome good octopus good polenta cant remember everything we had but they were all pretty good menu was intriguing oh i wanted to try their tripe obviously i dont remember a lot since the happy hour was so good .
thanks for not putting up your store hours i get here after 4 pm only to find u guys gone for the day so much for giving you a try based on yelp rating .
love their polenta love this place so happy to have this as a new neighborhood spot .
i would give them zero stars if i could we made a reservation the day before came here 5 minutes early just in case they did not reserve a table for us at all and told us it would be a 45 minute wait .
fantastic addition to the neighborhood great beer and wine selection and the polenta is the best ive ever tasted the broccoli rabe and the cuban were also amazing will be back to knock out the rest of the menu .
nothing wonderful as the reviews claim i am from dallas and we have better burgers and fries there .
great food and kitschy atmosphere service is attentive and engaging good portions at extremely reasonable prices have been there many times and always enjoy our meals .
tried the salmon burger tonight ended up with food poisoning never had any issues in the past very unfortunate experience .
this is the best indian restaurant in new haven ive tried them all now and its better than the one in the old diner or that other one tandoori chicken might be the best ive ever had .
when my 9 burger came the patty was obviously one of those frozen discs you can buy at costco and the bun was still frozen inside the fries were ok .
very good food here good service nice quiet downstairs or bustling upstairs our top choice for indian food in the area .
mediocre is being generous understaffed and over priced .
excellent food fresh healthy options excellent service great ambience thank you will be back again .
terrible terrible service i give this place chances all the time but the servers all have awful attitudes and the wait to get your food take forever .
delicious very vegetarian friendly also very friendly .
we didnt have any beer so i cant speak to that but the burgers werent that good i figured i could have five guys for half the price and the same quality .
the yelp community has this place right good indian food with reasonable prices classy rajian yes i made that word up decor and attentive service i am surprised new haven does not do more and better indian but this place is on my short list .
after waiting over 12 an hour for the daily special i was told they were out this was on a thursday at noon time .
the food here is delicious the waiters are friendly and the décor is nicer than any of the other indian restaurants in new haven .
i appreciate grass fed beef burgers .
the food is pretty good but what really makes me choose zaroka above the other indian restaurants is the staff they are extremely friendly and willing to accommodate most needs in addition to having a cozy venue they also offer quick delivery .
super not vegan friendly the happy hour specials are good but the service is poor it looks like theres a new staff but they seem to have gotten rid of the fast nice waitresses and kept the super slow ones so they need to figure that out .
best of its type so far nann should be made fresh upon customer arrival great atmosphere great service .
decent food terrible service they have yet to honor one of the many reservations ive made they have no respect for your time and lie about reservations .
i came here slightly late for the buffet but the waiter was very attentive and i ended up having a wonderful meal there isnt that much selection but just enough for my needs and the food tasted pretty good .
overrated the turkey burger had way too much turkey in it and i woke up actually feeling sick the next day because my stomach didnt digest all that meat the fries were good sweet and reg but my burger was just nauseating .
delicious indian food good vibes and great location you wont be disappointed the dinner portions are just right and not overwhelming i prefer the lunch buffet for when i want to indulge and eat different things delightful dining experience delivered with astonishing service .
wtf dar you throw in stacked containers on what little hummus you actually gave us forget that its insanely unsanitary but the salad you added looks like its rotting never ever ordering from you again .
i frequent the buffet at zaroka it is an absolute new haven gem the food is amazingly delicious and the service is wonderful the staff is extremely friendly and helpful i highly recommend this spot .
the portions are large the food isnt bad but this reminded me of an ethnic restaurant capital e capital r you would find in the suburbs its always empty the wine and beer list is terrible and the place just generally lacks personality would not recommend .
place is pretty solid the rogan josh is one of the best indian meals you can get worth trying the place is somewhat outdated and gaudy but the food is very good and priced reasonably .
the owner was horrible and rude i go there about 2 a week and the first time i ordered delivery it was probably the worst experience through any place that delivers ive ever had do not order from here .
dont let the exotic names intimidate youthe menu is great and the food doesnt disappoint attentive service staff as well .
note the restaurant has been approved for a liquor license but they dont currently have a bar nor is it byob if you want wine beer or mixed drinks with your meal look elsewhere at least for the time being .
zaroka is my fav indian restaurant in new haven i recommend the chicken makani sag paneer veggie simosas and naan bread requested it to be catered for a meeting and it was a hit the staff is very friendly too .
pastries were certainly a day old which is kind of a no no for a bakery only been here once but would certainly not recommend .
a lot of variety here and plenty of veg options like at thali thali too but with much better speedier service a good deal if youre splitting entrees among a big group .
i know better than to trust a place that can make paella in 20 minutes but i was hungry so went for it huge portion but far from authentic sigh pluses included the service and free parking decor is very dated .
this is my favorite indian restaurant in new haven cant beat the lunchtime buffet love the dinner menu the staff are wonderful and the atmosphere is great .
once is more than enough 1 star for the sangria .
very reasonably priced and the food is really good .
ick dry .
phenomenal food amazing cheese decent drink selection huge fan of the bistro bar atmosphere great for catching up with friends dates and enjoying a night out .
theyre overpriced the menu is deceiving and the food isnt anything special dont waste your time .
the poutine was great the cheeseburger was excellent however i think they need to cool it with the fries the fries seem everywhere service was nice and attentive .
saw a huge line out the door of this place and decided to give it a try nothing special ordered the portobello and leek sandwich very average nothing to write home about .
love the grilled cheese and macaroni and cheese amazing food the staff is knowledgeable about the food their serving and will find the best wines to make your dinner superb the decor is casual but romantic so great for date night enjoy .
i ordered 5spice pork belly when i finished it felt nothing special as expected but i think they overpriced the sandwiches 8 is expensive actually there is a similar shop nearby but the price there is fair anyway thats it .
loved it my toddler loved it my husband and inlaws loved it the beet salad was perfect right proportions of greens beets dressing outdoor seating is nice great lunch options and super friendly staff dont forget to stop by the cheese shop downstairs .
you wont cut a sandwich in half seriously .
eat everything you wont regret it then go into the cheese shop and buy all the cheeses in and around sooooooo amazing they have excellent wine choices as well be adventures it pays off .
i truly do like this place but it pisses me off when i order the barbecue brisket and get back to my office to eat it and low and behold the brisket has a 90 fat content that just ruined my lunch .
great modern american restaurant good food at good prices pretty good cheese board .
i would have liked to try this place but they refuse to make a sandwich without mayonnaise uncool maybe the other ingredients are so lowquality that they dont want to serve them without a layer of globby fat to cover up the flavor .
bread and butter never disappoints specials are creative and delicious great wine menu a little dramatic w hours reservations etc but the food is worth it .
not bad but not as good as baoguette cafe for its bun mi sandwitch .
caseus is most certainly my favorite spot in town to loosen up a few notches on the old belt .
i was so disappointed to learn from their website that their semolina bun contains eggs and is certainly not vegan this after eating their vegetarian sandwiches many times phooey .
best experience weve had in a long while we had leftovers for days and they were still delicious we went for an anniversary dinner and it did not disappoint great food great staff excellent beer on tap and the wine pairings were on point .
not a fan i got the catfish sandwich which was small and overpriced i was still hungry afterwards its different from your regular sandwich shop but i dont plan on going back again .
without a doubt my new favorite place for dinner with the wife been 4 times now the chef always comes up with new great things i think i have ordered the special everytime i have gone awesome place make sure and make reservations gets busy .
the pork sandwich was nothing special not worth 8 especially when the guy at the window is super rude .
i love it here fresh food and a seasonal menu everything is creative and thoughtful their duck is always done well and their selections cheeses is magnificent i always leave stuffed favorites so far duck carbonara bone marrow .
this place has good food but i ordered ice tea and it came in a wine glass with ice i had couple of refills and got charged for 7 its a total rip off .
the best restaurant in new haven the most imaginative and everchanging menu that is impressive every time out its always a treat to come here my number one choice when going to dinner in town fantastic and knowledgeable waitstaff go to caseus immediately .
everything was over cooked all steaks party of 10 queen cut tbone rib eye and cowboy were over cooked salmon was dry .
i would eat here every day if i wouldnt gain weight sit on the patio for lunch get sangria and be sure to get the daily bread and butter and save room for the chocolate pot de creme delicious a new haven must .
back in the day dons had it goin on but now well it sux plenty of other places very close by can be optional but dont waste your time and money here its just not worth it .
visiting yale with our high school son we found this great restaurant and decided to try it exceptional service really great cheese burger and mac and cheese did i say exceptional service .
food is always good no matter what you get here so whats the reason for 2 stars well my its a bit too damn expensive for just filipino food the seating is terrible the service is worst unless youre white then theyll treat you well lol .
the cabot clothbound cheddar and effies oat cakes is fantastic andrew gave us a great intro the taste of new haven tour took us here and it was indescribably perfect .
mussels were not fresh service is beyond poor yet they try to sneak in a mandatory 18 tip without even telling you they still give you they do not write in the tip they try to be sneaky .
if i could give 6 out of 5 stars i would love love love this place .
this place sux i went here one time and thats all it took i been to lots of pinoy places that been so better then this place .
wanted to go there forever it was totally worth it amazing service attentive knowledgeable personable the restaurant cheese shoppe were both amazing cant wait to go back i seriously suggest that you make a reservation thoughotherwise make sure you dont have other plans .
not sure why a fillipino restaurant that makes good filipino food would want to not promote itself as such stick to the filipino dishes they are good this is their specialty for thai food go to a thai restaurant .
this is an example of everything right in a restaurant what a treat the food is my favorite food in the entire world do you get a sense of how good this place is go enjoy .
traveling to boston we stopped for a quick meal the service was rotten slow and inattentive the food was pretty good for casual chinese but overall i would not stop here for a meal .
the grilled cheese sandwich was super tasty and filling if youre a cheese lover i would definitely recommend this i also ordered an assortment of cheeses for an appetizer which was a fun way to try a little bit of everything .
m allmenus comctnewha… so you can look up the menu online .
great everything definitely a place to indulge grilled cheese mac and cheese duck confit steak its all great and they have a great bear and wine selections the staff is always nice but a bit too reserved for new haven but the place has a great pub vibe .
here we are waiting for a sandwich and salad 25 minutes and counting place is virtually empty service indifferent food is not as good as it looks and they run out early place is beautiful customers are friendly were all in this together .
i fantasize about the grilled cheese sandwich .
staff was rude and had an attitude oatmeal was a little too watery would rather go to starbucks where the baristas are actually pleasant .
ive been here at least 4 times while visiting my brother at yale one of our favorite places to go eat some meats cheeses and hearty comfort food will miss it for sure .
green tea latte was bitter wayyy too bitter that i had to throw it away put too much matcha food was okkkkkkk kinda rude bakery lady tho the guy was nice .
i had a meat and cheese platter here and it was delicious .
food is decent the pastries are good the seating situation and slow service are big minuses one or the other is fine too many laptops for a nice atmosphere oddly loud acoustics is distracting .
great food good service was really impressed with the wine selection some south african wines that are hard to find and some really good french wines paired well with the variety of cheeses the burger and mac n cheese was amazing a little pricey but worth it .
i just ate a tuna sandwich for which the bread was so stale it was barely edible .
yep still my favorite place in ct great owner great food great cheese good beer .
nice looking place nice location terrible chocolate waffles waffle tasted cheap and the chocolate sauce was watery cmon guys you cannot be charging premium prices for low quality food not too long at least cappuccino was average at best .
the roasted chicken i had the last time i went to caseus was the best food ive had in any restaurant in any place i love this place and cant recommend them highly enough .
im very dissatisfied at this place the food was very cold and the tacos were burnt i dont recomend this place el mariachi loco was way better .
pricey for a bistro but not for the quality and presentation i love coming here for lunch delicious little cornichons on the table and the cheese shop downstairs is a marvel also great wine and beer .
this place has no clue how to be ran i came in here to get lunch and there were people standing all over the place and i had no clue where to order so i got out of that dump .
intense dinner cant go wrong with anything cheesebased here huge portions i really enjoyed my mac cheese as well as tastings of my pals burgersteakfries had a crazy pork belly on waffle dessert as well as chocolate pudding to end the meal perfection .
just called to place an order and they said can you call back in 5 minutes i think not .
this place is refreshing with all their beers wine and cheese the food was yum outdoor seats nice reminded me of pari .
eh tried a couple times over the last year or so but at best its an average sandwich and the folks at the counter seem like they wish they were somewhere else where they didnt have to deal with people .
very kind if busy staff who can direct you to the gluten free options often there are soups burgers with no buns meat best salads ive had on this coast .
i was excited to try this place and then i saw that they offer one sandwich for 14 dollars then i left because i cant support their kids college fund until the 11th of never .
i had lunch here venison meatloaf was good stuff i like their fries i like them a lot .
tomato sauce is too acidic and makes almost everyone sick who eats it they keep increasing their prices and are pretty unfriendly .
really cool place low ceilings etc excellent and interesting food and wine .
cute from the outside a bit diasppointing on the inside cheap table clothes everything felt a little dingy staff was a bit rude and slow my sandwich was tasty my mom got food poisoning from hers wouldnt go back .
gotta love caseus the food is really great i love almost everything ive eaten there the cheesier the better the atmosphere is low key and fun the wine list is exceptional and the menu always has something new and surprising a real winner .
cuter from the outside decent food though love their smoothies .
finally a worthwhile and memorable french restaurant in new haven a splendid selection of wines cheese platters and organiclocal delights there is a separate lunch and dinner menu available on line for you to review in advance indulge in of the many platters of cheese and meats .
delivered here in 2000 mario ripped me off a days pay when i quit told me not to show up there and he would mail it to me 13 years later still waiting .
tasteful dining with euro cafe feel and wonderful cheese options to go well worth the stop even if just wind and cheese snack or desert .
the food was terrible in this place wouldnt recommend place was empty for a reason .
yummy but pricey for just lunch .
placed delivery order one hour and half ago tried calling no one picks up heading out to pick up kfc avoid at all cost .
outstanding restaurant i can always count on a great meal at caseus the lunch is great but the dinners are out of this world and the chocolate pot au creme is therapeutic .
little food a lot of money to me not a traditional mexican restaurant more like a shishi restaurant sorry .
i liked this little restaurant as you can see this is the kind of place that is best to just enjoy the offerings of the chef and the company you have no need to over analyze it go and be surprised .
they changed the schedule without advise the customers i arrived there at 1030 and it was closed despite it was like open in website yelp .
we just enjoyed having dinner at caseus made a reservation for next week before even paying our check what more can be said great staff good food nice evening .
falafel is very avg whats good is the hot sauce omg i love the hot sauce so i just buy it from them but the falafels are very average .
since writing my first review of caseus i have moved to new haven i am still in love with caseus i branched out and had sauteed rabe and one of their superb salads for lunch i have since learned how to spell recommend correctly too .
sorry but a pita stuffed with lettuce tomato onion should be a cheap falafel by the time you get to the little dried out falafel at the bottom you should realize it sucks long live ali babas we miss you .
nice food particularly the buffet .
i didnt feel anything special about mamouns it felt like a normal average falafel that happened to attract large crowds .
fantastic little holeinthewall in an unassuming strip mall have only been here once for takeout but am already a huge fan the prices are very competitive and the food is fantastic and im very picky about indian food cant wait to try more of the menu .
the whole place smells like lamb shawarma and thats the smell i love however their shawarma didnt taste as good as it smells the meat was so try the falafel was such a disappointment too .
the restaurant isnt the prettiest in the world but the food is fantastic .
this place is overhyped and their customer service isnt that great you can get much better food across the street at the holeinthe wall falafel place .
this place is so good i was really surprised how good the buffet was especially since i hate buffets and the service was prompt the is a must dine .
very disappointing the tabbouleh was dry and had lettuce and some other greenery instead of parsley i was here back in the day and there is no comparison .
we have been going here for close to 10 years food is always outstanding staff are friendly and very attentive we have taken many friends here all of which love it i have been to many indian restaurants this by far is my favorite .
disgusting swarma for all those who said it was good you have obviously never had real swarma it was just fatty lamb bits and pieces this review is based purely on that the baklava was nice i am really looking forward to trying the chicken and falafel .
how often do you find a restaurant that feels like home my wife and i come here every friday after the stressful work week and the good food friendly service always helps us start the weekend right we are moving soon and will miss this special place .
ive been here many times but the food is below average ive had better falafel schwarma etc the pita bread also doesnt really taste fresh .
love this place great food fantastic service even with the buffett you get freah nan bread right out of the oven highly recommend especially if you are on a budget .
this falafel is grainy and bland the toppings were wilted and the pita was hard and tasteless i recommend falafel shop on rivington instead .
just discovered this place last saturday we ended up going in for the lunch buffet all i have to say is a little bit of awesomeness here in orange ct check it out .
impersonal curt service no charge tahini sauce apparently they dont have any undercooked greasy side of falafel 1 50 deplorable disgusting .
good service ordered two drinks and they were brought out almost immediately also ordered french fries which only took about 5 minutes and they were delicious and thick cut absolutely amazing .
i have never had falafel before so i was bit skeptical when we stopped here even after having one i am still not sure how i feel arent chick peas supposed to be healthy not if they are deep fried in oil .
visited the place twice on two separate visits to philly both times were great great beer selection and the food was good as well the people working there are super cool and laid back even with foggy head hangovers .
i hate this place it wasnt that clean and very rude hosts very dirty i got discussed from the way they cook the food i dont recommend you eating from there .
great beer selection plenty of foreign beers to choose from as well as das boots havent had the food but from a beer standpoint this place is great my girlfriend also had the apple pie in a jar cocktail which was outstanding .
sorry guys this place used to be a lot better because of all the attention they have been getting i guess they have lowered their standards the falafel is dry seriously and they raised their prices .
sat outside on a beautiful evening great german food and excellent choice of beers good service reasonable prices would return when in philly .
i got the lamb schwarma bowl to go the lamb was dry the sauce was bland and the salad base was lame im sad this place didnt live up to the hype .
nice place to grab a beer or two and enjoy nicely prepared german food .
partys over this place made me violently sick taïm from now on twice as expensive but exponentially more delicious .
dont judge by its grungy looks great beer selection and food was surprisingly very good clearly the kitchen does not play second fiddle to the bar mussels spaetzle schnitzel dinners all highly recommended .
kofta kofte pita was 15 mango juice 1 25 awesome 55 falafel 2 55 id do more mango juice cheap baklava next time better yet mamouns mango juice two bros 1 slice cheeps belgium fries yummy 5 25 meal .
buffalo wings awesome my boyfriend and i got fireball shots and jack cokes great experience id come back for sure nice atmosphere which is also a plus .
yes its cheap but i didnt even enjoy it when i was drunk super hyped up place and the hot sauce is not even enjoyable its just deathly spicy and i love spicy .
amazing beer options and their burgers are great every time i go i try to order something different but i cant get past the burger list the fact that pretzel rolls are standard and their fires are chunky cut just makes everything better .
mahmouns is only good when youre drunk there i said it .
come here for he appetizers they have pretzel bites keep the cheese sauce i like the mustard pirogues and wings are good but the best is their beer selection i like the dirty ho hoegaarden and framboise that is a great drink .
the food is awful i ordered falafel my friend ordered shawarma both of us believe that the food are not tasty at all the place smells as well i really cannot understand why people love that place a lot .
wow we came here yesterday and had to come back today just for the pretzels the mustard with horseradish is my fav .
this place is not all that great when youre sober the shawarma is just meh the hot sauce is ridiculously spicy it just kills your taste buds good for really late night but other hours not worth it .
potato pancakes were delicious my husband had the bratwurst dish and loved it and i had the mushroom spetzle highly recommend it .
mamouns i used to swear by you but alas i was just a newbie to falafel when in the area after leaving a village bar you could do the trick maybe but that line of tourists usually leads me to taco truck .
this place has an unbelievable german beer selection pretty cool atmosphere and friendly waitstaff this place loves hasselhoff and all things german on the down side there is one small bathroom and their prices are on the high side .
mamouns you are so cheap and so great for late night drunkfood but alas you are also for falafel noobs im sorry lettuce tomato and mayonnaisey white sauce on a store bought pita just doesnt do it for me anymore .
i recently visited philly for my first time and stayed next to bierstube this is such a great little bar wonderful food and selection of beer the bar tenders are very friendly and welcoming it was so good i went twice while i was in philly .
their hummus smells like an old man nuff said .
a really good selection of different beers the prices are reasonable as well we didnt have time to try the food though one tiny bathroom however yikes .
not impressed i came here for lunch and ordered a shawarma and i have definitely had better the place is tiny cheap and in a great area but thats pretty much it but i guess i should come back and try something else maybe .
definitely a bar environment but a great place for beer and burgers they have fantastic pretzels and amazing hefeweizen .
they are dry and flavorless i will not waste any money in this falafel place the good one in nyc is hoomoos asli in soho 1000 times better than this mamouns .
we had a great cheese plate here with tomato jam that was fantastic service was ok not fantastic great selection of beers of course .
ive been to both of these west village one better than east village very limited toppings no syrian garlic pickles or cabbage like most places meat is good but not amazing overhyped .
these guys had 3 different octoberfests that were all on special for 3 all excellent the pretzel nuggets w beer cheese sauce and mustard really took the cake tho probably the best pretzels ive ever had large portions too .
while the food was good the bug in the salad was not so tasty it looked like an import from outside new york making me question if they wash their salad or not it was a sad discovery because i love the food .
outstanding beer selection food is phenomenal try their pierogies as a polish chick totally recommend it .
totally overrated the price is unbeatable yes but there are other falafel shops on the same street that will give you a falafel sandwich for 2 50 that isnt overstuffed with old dry lettuce .
first time that ive got a pretzel bun with sauerkraut patty and sausage and i have to say it was great price was cheap and service very nice .
underwhelming back in vancouver id heard of the legend of mamouns from a guy who makes better shawarma so perhaps i came on a seriously off day i cant really recommend this place especially when theres far better falafel in manhattan .
i can only speak for the beer they have a pretty vast selection they also have a boot you can drink out of but its super pricey like forty bucks or something but its a lively environment and the people are festive check it out for yourself .
i bought a tub of tabbouleh salad here when i got it home and opened it up a small brown cockroach was running around inside gross .
awsome place great selection of beer belgian beer try it its awsome .
stopped in for drinks i felt like i had just walked into jersey nice place if you are into that sort of thing but it was not for me .
we came in for dinner great presentation good food friendly service and byob what else could you need .
service sucks its overpriced and the food is just barely above garbage .
byob bought a groupon for 4 for 55 bucks good service and the food was good not too many people .
the portions are silly stupid large why they should focus on quality not size you typical nj greek owned diner experience lots of fat customers duh .
went here for dinner and the service was excellent the salmon and chocolate cake were our favorites .
the food was ok at best and service was decent having options i would not return .
the food was absolutely fantastic i had the spanish ceviche which was quite nice but what really blew me away was the goat cheese gnocchi it has a very homey sort of decor and the wait staff is very friendly if youre in the area definitely stop by .
mediocre at best .
my first review on yelp service and food is comparable if not better than michelin 3 star jean georges price very affordable i highly recommend this restaurant .
the service staff is diligent and indulging however the menu is indifferent and unchanging and vegetarians beware in the versailles a grilled vegetable salad is dish with grilled chicken so with all menu items read the small print .
best soup i had in a long long time chickenkale doesnt sound appetizing but its good trust me .
i wish i wish i so wish i could like this place owners a jackass roaches and rats are you kidding me blamed me and said that i brought them into his restaurant stay away from this place .
lovely restaurant great dinner gracious server left feeling so relaxed and happy and well treated for a very reasonable price well be back .
super rude girl server on weekday mornings shes made me wanna leave that place two of the three times ive been there food as such is okay and so is the coffee .
the food and ambiance is nice and its a block from my house its a bit pricey though and they seem understaffed as service is slow but they are very nice and yummy .
food quality is very bad it tasted stale as well restrooms are not maintained well they looked dirty .
utterly distinctive but satisfying food and a mellow vibe that fits the neighborhood when i lived in ditmas id take home their prepared foods and impress guests and coming back here a couple years later they still remembered my name .
i caterd from udipi 3 days ago they took 8 catering orders they messed up the order so please be careful when you order most places take large caretering orders and dont stay with it .
casual cafe with pretty awesome and varied food options the tlt blt with tempeh is tlt tasty lovely tempeh and one of the better and healthier sandwiches ive had in a while this is a bright spot in an area that is lacking for everything .
the burgers were really bad worst fried pickles ever but id think thats my mistake ordering fried pickles in the north even the milk shake sucked very disappointed with this place thank heavens theres a bobbys burger nearby .
im a big fan always great coffee nice selection and chill vibe looking forward to trying the new dinner service .
think this place has gone down hill ribs were not tender i got two chicken breast with sauce on top of dry rice bagged boil rice not even real rice only good thing here is atmosphere and sangriabeer .
such a great study spot i went on a late saturday afternoon and ordered the chicken salad sandwich and coffee the food was wonderful and the staff was very friendly and checked in regularly i ended up staying right until they closed im definitely going back .
pizza is nothing great service is eh theres much better places in the area .
good airy study spot or healthy eats wifi patio and near the fg .
horrible stale pizza has not been good since ownership changed hands however the staff is nice and courteous .
great place for coffee and a snack in windsor terrace the place feels very light and spacious i recently came here to kill time when i was locked out of my apartment their polenta cakes tea and artsy magazines managed to cheer me up .
pizza is lousy ever since they changed the owners years ago everything their has gone downhill just a typical boring pizzeria .
great spot in the neighborhood excellent food in a spacious casual setting .
mediocre pizza terrible service with nasty people .
love the food breakfast here rocks and the stumptown drip is the best the staff is courteous and friendly as the food is fresh and delicious this place gets busy too its great togo for the park right around the corner .
ribs are very fatty i felt like i was eating grizzle the whole time the fries were good .
im glad this place is in the neighborhood the staff is always friendly and the food is good its a tough spot to have a cafe because of the lack of traffic so i hope they can continue on .
i went there this past may and reading the reviews i was expecting some great soul food it was a major let down the chicken wasnt good however the mac cheese was pretty tasty it is not a place to run and tell everyone about in my opinion .
this place is adorable my boss and i work here from time to time when we just cant stand the office however we bring our own internet device if we didnt have one i would frequent this place much less often .
the food is good but customer service sucks my table and another table needed doggy bags but the waitress doggy bagged the other table and practically threw mine in my face so we can pack it up ourselves .
i was in this hood for a meeting and had a chicken salad with strawberries and some sort of cheese it was absolutely fabulous it was dressed perfectly it was all i had on the menu so i cannot speak for anything else but the salad rocked .
horrible service waited 30min for our food just to get the wrong order food was just mediocre at best and they add in the tip we were only a party of 2 no wonder service sucks wont be coming back here anytime soon .
i like this place for brunch its delicious has good fresh produce i also like it for picking up some healthy quick snacks where else in the hood could you get quinoa salad kale but its too bad that its a bit overpriced .
came here for lunch really wanting to like this place but the food simply sucks and lacks flavor .
one of our favorite places in bay ridge solid food decent beer list fantastic beer garden and very friendly staff we will definitely keep coming back .
this used to be one of my favorites but it has gone downhill over the years the last straw was finding a long strand of hair in my fried whiting eeewwww .
a refreshing change of pace in bay ridge the waitersbartenders are friendly and welcoming love the everchanging selection i have discovered some great beers here i also love the food the waiter was spot on with recommendations i return whenever i can .
the catfish is amazing but it may be cold by the time it gets to your table the service is ridiculous food isnt good if you dont get to eat it .
100 awesome no question .
not impressed the chicken was ok the catfish wasnt that flavorful and it soggy i dont know why this place is has so much hype i will probably not come back here .
yessssss this place is great the food is excellent the atmosphere is laid back and cool a great place for a quick bite and the quality is outstanding .
not a fan for chicken waffles but i guess it was my first experience other things on the menu are not so good .
excellent selection of craft beer knowledgeable staff and cool vibe i have been here twice and enjoyed both visits i plan on going back many many times .
should of had the chicken and waffles just had the honey smothered fried chicken mac and cheese and collard greens i have to say i was very disappointed w the mac and cheese the fried chicken was really greasy overall disappointed boo .
yay they serve veggie hot dogs now tried the seattle dog and it was delicious great beer awesome backyard friendly staffpatrons and now vegetarian friendly food i couldnt be happier .
stopped in here after a night out ordered the chicken wings im not sure why people like the chicken because i wasnt impressed it was pricey and not worth the money paid .
great beer an awesome back yard excellent staff and they serve tofu dogs in a neighborhood with very few places that have vegan options this is why we go almost every week lockyard what did we do before you .
the salmon croquettescollard greens were pretty disappointing but i did enjoy the fried chicken on my first trip a little more .
awesome perfect pig out spot all hot dog creations are awesome not many places like this the only downsides is that they only serve beer and most of their seating is uncomfortable .
decor leaves something to be desires as does the food skip this one and go to melbas instead .
one of my favorite places to hang out in bay ridge nice backyard beer garden great beer selection and a variety of sausages like wild boar a great lobster roll too .
the last time i ate here i was enjoying my mac nd cheese collard greens and fried chicken until a roach crawled by on the wall where i was sitting on the upper level the end and never again .
good burger lots of beer choices i was disapointed in my choice of beer but thats no ones fault but mine haha i chose incorrectly its a chill place its got good food you wont be disappointed .
nice staff worndown brand mediocre food unhappy atmosphere .
love this place for the backyard great beer selection and bites to eat wouldnt go there for a dinner but definitely for after work drinks and weekend fun we need more places like this in our area .
really disappointing if youre going for the food dont overpriced for what it is and below average quality .
cant wait to head back in extensive beer list and awesome food music was on point indoor and outdoor seating .
came here for the chicken waffles chicken was great but waffles pancakes fruit toppings sticky tables dirty utensils and everything else sucked .
this could be the perfect they have live music an outdoor beer garden a fantastic selection of beers and ciders awesome comfort food menu of build your own brattasticness the staff is attentive and super friendly lets see what else what else nice big clean bathrooms yes perfect .
i was truly hoping to be blown away from brunch here but i left less than impressed nothing special or mouthwatering or even memorable the highlight of the meal was the pie i will not be returning .
this place has great food a spin on the traditional bar menu waffle fries galore sauce selection is great outdoor seating in the back is a huge plus .
this food is not good and the fried chicken is disgusting it always amazes me how people rave about simple tasteless food save your self the time by grabbing a chicken box at a local fast food joint .
love this great new bay ridge spot great dogs ever changing craft beer selection and a place that when you walk in you feel like you kicking back at home with some friends bonus come out on wednesdays for trivia night .
5 50 for a teenie weenie slice of bourbon pecan pie thats the size of a little birds beak cmon pies thighs at least give us a slice thats worth the price tastes good though .
my husband our two kids and a few friends celebrated my husbands birthday here last month the people at lock yard could not have been friendlier or more accommodating lots of beer lots of hot dogs sausages and pretzels and a very friendly neighborhood vibe .
not only was the wait staff rude guy in a jean jacket vest repeatedly pushed past me and only uttered excuse you but after a long wait we never got the apple pies we paid 4 each for will not come back .
what can i say that hasnt already been said the staff is amazing and the food is great the beer selection is not something im qualified to speak on but i will say they always have a delicious cider for me .
this place is so ridiculously over rated its not even funny i feel people only rate this place high because they have to so many better places to eat in nyc and brooklyn you want a good place to eat in brooklyn try the brooklyn star on lorimer .
great pub just the kind of place bay ridge needs the outdoor seating area in the back is very nice the craft beer the finger foods and the hot dogs are all good stuff definitely will be coming back here often .
the chicken honey biscuit looked incredible but im vegetarian so theres that my semi cold apple pie wasnt worth the hour plus wait .
awesome beer selection the food is great too the price is right for everything backyard is def the place to spend your time here with a bunch of friends all the wait staff is great also .
the food is lacking for me the pies taste ok but the chicken was horrible there was no flavor no spice i dont know if i just caught them on an off day but i would not go back .
great local pub beer variety and delicious food the fried pickles are amazing the bartender was well versed on what was a tap and patiently provided sample to ensure i picked the right selection overall would go back good local garden a breath of fresh air to bayridge .
its good and simple the food is not complicated very straightforward which is what a lot of restaurants lack these days but i would not go out of my way to get some piesnthighs .
good saugage and beers very friendly staff .
finally able to come to piesnthighs and was somewhat disappointed food was ok had their pies twice and it was inconsistent when it came down to texture and taste .
great place to have a drink a lot of options and a great staff the food is hit and miss but after a few drinks it isnt bad at all .
waaaay overrated if you are a true southerner or know good southern food you will be disappointed the cornbread is dry and the chicken is just average i think the chicken at popeyes tastes better .
great service staff is very knowledgeable of beer nice outdoor space great beer selection .
the good the chicken sandwich the portions were sizable the bad horrible service they brought out the wrong dish there was a fly in my water i would have been willing to forgive everything if the waitress had been a little nicer .
love this place great beer selection great service beautiful backyard its nice to see more and more craft beer spots opening up in bay ridge .
waited over a hour for delivery completely unacceptable .
just moved to the neighborhood and was welcomed here immediately fantastic craft beer selection along with great choice of hotdogs .
i went in expecting great chicken and i got was bland soggy chicken it was just awful i would never recommend this place the service was fantastic but i wanted great chicken with flavor .
the wait staff bar mag and owner tommy are very friendly and the food is spot on .
although our food was tasty i had the seasonal sidessesame kale mashed potatoes i was overcharged from what the menu said despite having asked two different waitresses the atmosphere was fun the music was atrocious .
really nice neighborhood place with great sausage and an amazing beer selection even better the beer garden looks like a great spot in the warmer months definitely worth another visit .
chicken was super salty the biscuits were cold and the mac and cheese was lumpy not at all was it was cracked up to be the servers were very pleasant and they gave us an accurate wait time for a busy saturday night .
heated outdoor patio the service has gotten worlds better since they first opened i cant express how happy i am that this place is here .
i really wanted to love this place there wasnt anything that made it stand out we only had pie but i wish i had the fried chicken because ive heard its pretty amazing .
wow what a lucky find some of the best bar food ive ever had most menu items feature an unusual spin on comfort food and the flavors are incredible try the prospect heights waffle fries with raspberry bbq sauce goat cheese and youll see what i mean .
earlier this year my friend and i got food poisoning from the chicken biscuit we called the next day to warn pies and thighs to protect other customers they werent interested at all it makes me completely nauseous to read the words pies n thighs .
very friendly professional staff and chef great and cute bartender the food is great but very heavy and very limited the prices are fantastic the beer selection and music unbeatable a great addition to the neighborhood .
im still waiting on that mac and cheese i ordered and paid for 3 months ago im not going anywhere until i get it .
cool new addition to bay ridge love the outside seating area with heat lamps hung out there comfortably midnovember good beer selections very friendly service good pub food although the garlic pesto fries had me choked up in tears and not terribly pricy .
dont believe the hype even kfc tastes twice as good sorry .
love the lock yard great space good music cider on tap for this nonbeerdrinker kid friendly in the afternoon at least can hardly wait to go back .
overrated go to popeyes instead just bring hot sauce with you .
good bar food nice design big patio and strong beer list fine service and chill vibe .
meh ive experienced better the pulled pork bun seriously tastes like eels not the band i was in asheville nc last month 12bones now thats how pulled pork is supposed to taste the canyoupleasewaitoutsidething is ridiculous i also think its over priced staff and music are ok though .
awesome new spot in bayridge outdoor patio is great might need some more heaters as the weather gets cooler beer selection is on point food options seemed good waffle fries were amazing definitely will continue to check this place out and hope the beer selection changes often .
it could rival crown or kennedys fried chicken as far as im concerned overpriced overrated and the wait time is ridiculous waiting 20 minutes for overpriced and mediocre food does not make me a happy camper at all .
great beer selection awesome staff food is great but started off a little rocky was fixed immediately and mgr bought us a round the atmosphere rocks go here .
it was really disappointing i have yet to experience satisfying 13 fried chicken the potatoes too were disappointing just avoid it the popularity has lulled them into a false sense of accomplishment .
amazing beer and sausage place if your in the area you need to stop by this place .
not sure why everyone goes nuts over this place the chicken was average and really greasy the mac and cheese tasted exactly the same as kfc mac and cheese and the biscuit was pretty stale .
been here twice so far food was amazing and the beer selection is also great selling point is definitely the backyard where you can enjoy both of these in a very relaxing atmosphere .
their chicken is not that good their macaroni and cheese is not very good it is over priced and over rated .
ive only had the aloo tikki chaat but it was excellent will come back to try more but so far so good .
bleh not sure what all the fuss is about the chicken was medicore at best i can get the same thing for 5 bucks at the local chinese food takeout place in manhattan instead it was 9 bucks in hip williamsburg .
breakfast review simple menu low key no wait good service good food this is a great hole in the wall for breakfast the breakfast burrito home fries pancakes and coffee are all very good .
youre only a few blocks away from broadway popeyes is across the stream and my nuts iz on your chin .
excellent ribeye burrito with green chile in out of the way locale but fare is solid bit pricey and staff can have addition issues but tasty creation worth trying once tough time accommodating large groups as facilities and staff are limited .
the smell of this place used to make me sick when i would go running bleh .
great breakfast joint fast and delicious had vege burrito hubby had huevos rancheros kids breakfast is pancake bacon and one egg perfect size .
this place was awful my partner got really bad food poisoning from their pulled pork burgers and the service wasnt great stay away unless you want to be sick for days .
excellent inexpensive breakfast spot thats never too crowded but not a ghost town the breakfast burrito is a must try and the specials are always dope .
meh .
ciscos wow my favorite is brunch tamales with egg on top get verde too chips and salsa amazing too very light .
take out only at 115 am even though still advertising 3 am close and plenty of people sitting and eating find another late night spot for snacks .
loved the burrito smothered with green chile so far the best mexican food ive eaten since moving to east coast .
the sliders aint nothing to cheer about cute waitresses tho .
good solid breakfast the space is a bit worn but their customers really seem to love this place i can see why dont let the neighborhood scare you the service here is friendly and they are willing to take order changes it will definitely fill you up .
overrated is a good way to put it the shakes are good the sliders are just greasy not in any way memorable .
i found this restaurant thanks to yelp they have amazing breakfast burritos its a smaller place but has such a family feel .
typical bar not impressed .
really really great breakfast its a little holeinthewall but ciscos is very clean and attractive inside i cant wait to try it for lunch sometime this is our new goto breakfast joint without a doubt .
nothing to write home about i found this place a little disappointing the burgers were average at best .
go to other mexican places sometimes bit always come back here for the real thing hands down the most authentic mexican food in the area dont let the decor fool you the food is amazing and priced right it is byob and a liquor store next door .
2 50 a slider a bit overpriced and really not worth the price im a petite girl and would need a few to fill me up i say spend the money elsewhere .
delicious food waitress doesnt really speak english but you dont really need that worth the drive total hole in the wall must go absolutely must go and careful you might drive past it .
nothing special i only had it one time so ill give it another shot but i wasnt a big fan of the flavor and quality .
great food glad to find mostly authentic mexican food in connecticut .
horrible i tried to call in for delivery attitude pissed me off to the point i didnt even try it .
the food is really great very authentic but above all the owners and staff are absolutely wonderful they are so warm and welcoming .
this was really really bad i ordered chinese for my team at work the person on the phone was extremely rude and angry that i did not pay cash the food was bad the rice was mexican rice and i am not sure that the meat was chicken .
inexpensive quick and very good fresh mexican food for breakfast and lunch the variety and uniqueness is at breakfast lunch selections are average decent fish tacos hole in the wall atmosphere the staff are friendly overall better in the morning but not a bad lunch spot .
excellent food but the worst service ever all staff very rude not cool kills the fun atmosphere .
right down the street from my house very nice people good food and decent prices the ambience is not great so i wouldnt go there on a date but nice to just grad something to eat also they have a nice breakfast .
food is below average waiters are not professional at all .
i finally found authentic mexican food in central connecticut since i was raised in the san francisco bay area i would like to consider myself a pro when it comes to mexican food trust me on this one just go do it .
slow slow slow .
ciscos is great for breakfast recommended newington ct the food and service are great at this establishment breakfast is very good if you like the latin style breakfast cuisine which i love parking is vast but seating is limited recommended .
we had the fish and chips and an oyster roll while the crust on the fish and the brine of the oysters were nice the insides were all mush like the fish and oysters were either mishandled or inferior goods fries were overcooked and mushy too mushfest .
perfect tacos fresh tasting authentic mexican food with friendly service will be going back many times .
waste of time they dont honor reservations worst portuguese restaurant in the ironbounds i have no faith in the way they treat their customers dont go here they fail at customer service .
we went for dinner saturday night loved it we knew the owners from east west grill so glad they have their own place affordable bring your own wine excellent food worth the trip .
dont sit at back because you wont be well served .
clean food i love the fish tacos here and i think my wife is having a love affair with the burritos the owners are polite and welcoming people i highly recommend this place .
the original chef is gone and so is the yumminess sad just sad .
cisco is the best no elaboration needed .
must have been there on an off night food was not that great and the staff while nice were inattentive best thing was the amuse buche .
the food was good not great the side dishes were awesome but what really made the experience was the server sassy older lady who kept cracking jokes had us laughing the whole time i would be back just for another round of sarcastic sparing with here .
their chicken is good but there business management is extremely poor every time and we have ordered many times they are out of something tonight they did not have chicken breasts how do you have a chicken restaurant and not have chicken breast in stock .
the food is excellent and the service as well sam ajushi the general manager is very welcoming to costumers and makes them feel like theyre at home .
had cashew tofu and vegetables was awfultasted burnt and tofu was very tough waiter was very unpleasant and i would not go again my husband experienced the same distaste for the dinner egg rolls were good .
first time we enjoyed great cross section of korean japanese dishes i would have rated it a 5 but they were not well prepared or versed in gluten free dishes components .
the food is not that great the place has been known to give people food poisoning .
always happy here what can i say further i will always bring friends and family here everything is fresh and the service is fantastic .
update this place fell off very fast the food quality is terrible the service slow and it just creeps me out oh well .
fantastic place the taste is great and price is very reasonable its definitely one of the best korean restaurants in town .
cold pizza a generic can of soda 4 eh .
so delicious dont be fooled by the run down looking plaza we did the grill and it was fantastic .
this place is not good i tried everything on offer and found nothing i liked the food was cold should have known never to come to a buffet .
finally a 5 star experience had a soon tofu as usual and also tried their bul gul gi dont know how to spell it but its rice cake so delicious and service was excellent i will return over and over again .
i went to terrazza yesterday 8714 and the restaurant has closed the sign on the door said a different place luce would be opening there soon .
had some kind of rice bowl with tons of sashimi on it for lunch very fresh delicious sticky rice maybe 14 for the bowl .
this place is alright service is good food is decent but wayyyy overpriced for basic italian food nothing special .
i love this place they provide great service and delicious sushi i ordered two sushi rolls that was fresh and well made also the staff are friendly and polite i would suggest that you place your order beforehand when youre ordering out for pick up .
service was ok calamari was good ok until plastic found fried onto it husbands sandwich was ice cold and my pasta was tasteless c for cleanliness will not be returning .
what a great find this place is food is delicious reasonably priced but most of all the service is incredible such great staff super friendly make you feel at home .
food was okay but way over priced service was slow we went here for my bday only because the original restaurant i wanted to go to was closed definitely a waste of time and money .
amazing bbq highly recommend bulgogi the best marinated beef in the area the portion is also very generous .
this place used to be my childhood favorites now it is sub par pizza crust is hard cheese is over cooked and way too oily im dissatisfied in the way the have fallen off but i guess all good things come to an end .
side dishes are the best and they are unlimited rice is 2 the marinades are outstanding at 25 i would expect larger meat portions that being said i would definitely recommend a visit .
we ordered a pizza from wilson last week and it was really disappointing there wasnt enough sauce and the sauce that was there had a weird bitter taste like a previous reviewer said the crust was too bready and soggy and the whole thing was a bit greasy .
i strongly suggest you only visit on an empty stomach the food is amazing and the staff is attentive and friendly the portions are ridiculously amazing doggy bags are inevitable i look forward to returning so i can take advantage of their b y o b option .
i got the regular chinese food here not the sushi but the food was horrible i got the chicken with mixed vegetables and the chicken had a weird breading on it i will never go back .
the next best thing to nyc korean bbq and food though we had several different staff servicing us we know theyll get it down sooner or later as for the food it didnt disappoint bbq and cooked meals .
found bugs in our food shortly after seeing them crawl out of the picture frame hanging on the wall next to our table made us pay for our entire meal never going back .
pork kalbi and sushi roll were so good you should try this new place im so happy to find this restaurant .
not worthy of even the one star keep trying to find a good chinese food place in hillsborough its just not happening .
kalbi was awesome and very well marinaded this place was very clean and staffs were very knowledgeable about the menu and friendly no doubt this would be another great place to dine out .
stay away this place has a bug problem and does nothing about it .
authentic korean food now available in the hartford area had a great meal with the family tons of bon chon small plates and great korean bulgogi bbq ill be back soon highly recommended .
out of bananas waitress picking at shorts could hear staff talking about us only ordering water .
stopped in for a quick drink loved the decor service was great very nice and happy people drinks were perfect def have to go back to try the food looks amazing .
a pretty typical diner in the northeast greek items sprinkled through the menu like olives in a salad prices on the high side of average food average diner quality beats dennys coffee on the dark side of average .
what a gem stopped in for a drink before a show i wish we could of stayed longer friendly service good drink will be stopping in for food the next time atmosphere is swanky and hip .
second time here food is great as is the wait staff but got food poisoning that sent me to the emergency room i will never return the food isnt worth almost dying for .
great thai for very reasonable price especially for nyc cocktails were 6 and beers for 3 cant beat that the atmosphere was great for a date or just a dinner out with friends would recommend take a couple blocks walk and get away from times square .
had high hopes but the raw clams were not fresh at all the place also lacked character disappointed .
best lunch spot in the area i am upset my office is moving away from here the food is delicious authentic and reasonably priced the thai iced tea which comes with the lunch special is a nice touch as well .
this place is okay if youre standing on the street and youre like im in the mood for some oysters and your friend goes oh look over there they sell oysters score there are better places to eat oysters and seafood in general plus the ambiance is whatevs .
loved the trendy ambiance its a cozy enough space that many people seem comfortable enough dining here alone the food was great and the sauces complimented my meal very well its definitely a spot i can see myself revisiting when in the midtown area .
sub standard quality of food pricey ordered indo chinese and the fried rice had 12 insects ants will never ever order from here horrible customer service too .
this place has a great pad kee mow the decor is interesting and the music is a little strange but overall i was very impressed with the lunch .
no indian taste the samosa chat was very good paneer chilly was horrible the paneer is like a stone you cannot bite it at all ambience is not so great they might have some items on their menu for takeout not suitable for dinein at all .
awesome currytaro puffs chicken dumplings like siumai but wo shrimp .
super slow ironic given the name mediocre food pricey for what you get wont be going back .
best happy hour that is not a happy hour awesome mixed drinks always priced at 6 cosmos lychee martini etc on the menu food is too salty stick with the apps service is excellent .
it was okay they serve appetizer after main course very bad service dont waste your time go to cross culture not for family .
extremely cool atmosphere and the best pad thai ive ever eaten the spring rolls were amazing as well i recommend you get the pad thai medium heat and then get hot sauce on the side .
it took 1 5 hours to serve my toddler ice cream as a result of their incompetence we could not enjoy our meal staff didnt care about anything .
lycée martini for 6 and its not happy hour im sold and their food is really good try the crispy spring rolls i love coming here when im in hells kitchen .
sorry to say but they have become very inconsistent with their food we did not enjoy the food last couple of times .
modern thai restaurantbar beautiful deco and exciting menu would love to dine there again a gem in the neighborhood friendly staff but small space though .
the service here is worst we ordered vegetable biryani and it was worst taste that i ever had this place is highly priced and they dont even have drinking water and you are forced to purchase a bottle .
yay i am a fan nine restaurant is a small trendy restaurant i got to try the volcano chicken calamari and shrimp spring rolls all the food looked and tasted fantastic .
food was ok service was horrible took nearly half an hour for food to be ready they should change the name to curry up and wait .
food was amazing and the service was on point and very friendly if any of my friends are out in nyc and want to have something to eat real quick on the westside this is a good thai spot .
very unfriendly staff you need to wait an hour to be served and an other 15 minutes to pay food was very average and uou smell oil after your breakfest .
i love this place they have an amazing lunch special that is well worth checking out this has become my goto place for thai in this area highly recommended nice atmosphere for dining in but they do take out as well .
dont even bother placing an order rude with hearing issues after taking forever to get my order right i had to finally cancel after he hung up forgetting to take down my cc .
excellent panang curry and tom yum soup ingredients very fresh and service friendly a great choice .
i ordered a egg platter maybe it isnt the special of this restaurant but i am still be disappointed a little bit .
very good thai food in hells kitchen good lunch combos the atmsphere is one of those modern trendy more american looking than traditional thai but the service was great and good food .
really yelp id go to this place if i was within a 50m radius but actually seeking it out to eat .
food is good but small portions and rice was a bit burntgreasy asianfusion atmosphere dark with neon lights relatively cheap food entree for 1015 cocktails for 6 beer for 3 fast courteous service kind of small spacewise .
nothing special not sure how this place is getting 4 stars .
papaya salad tasty and light fried calamari sinful but still fried worth going for a walk after chicken satay very good sauces tender and juicy the hit chicken pad thai very very good and just spicy enough overall great spot for a casual fast fun dinner .
seriously the food doesnt have to be so disgusting to qualify as an authentic dinner our breakfast was cheap and inedible .
surprisingly good it looks more like a cocktail bar than a thai restaurant its both cocktails were decent food was very good very good traditional pad thai good spring rolls i didnt have it but folks liked the chicken satay we liked the beef salad too .
looked in turned right around i am a fan of diners but this wasnt for me surprised it was rated so highly on yelp .
respectable and relatively new thai joint in the neighborhood of thai joints not terribly busy and fair prices for your standard bangkok style fare would repeat .
gross food terrible service .
i really like that their rice and noodle dishes come with a variety of options instead of just chicken beef or shrimp i had the pad thai with the tilapia and it was very good i will definitely go back again .
i dont get the high reviews of this place coulda made a breakfast like this myself at home sure its cheap but unfortuantely wasnt anything special .
fresh delicious food 9 dumplings pineapple fried rice and pad thai were all amazing .
came back here after about 2 years it seems the ambiance now outshines the food i would only come here for drinks and sushi now at one point i would have called it a hidden gem pity .
amazing food highly recommend the pad udon has a little kick to it that really adds to the overall meal .
extremely overpriced for what it is and food is good but not amazing .
the staff is always pleasant and nice the food is good wether its eat in or takeout a pleasant little gem in hells kitchen .
online fraud charges beware of fraudulent charges on your credit card after placing orders online several of us experienced 100 starbcks card charges afterward .
food is great you get great lunch deals best thai food ive ever had .
did take out pizza prosciutto the ham was either old or not good quality they send wrong beverages dont recommend go to rosa on 69th and grand .
i love everything from this place nice decor nice staff excellent food i have the pad see ewe spring rolls and foil salmon .
terrible service whats the worst is the owner put together three tables of cheap food but charged us 27person when we came in as a group of 30 people .
ive been here a few time they have a good happy hour the food was so tasty friendly servers and beautiful decor i am a big fan now .
ill be brief the food is good but the portions are very very small and the prices are very very big .
love the place it was clean good food great servers quick and kind recommend the place if you are around midtown looking for good not expensive food .
terrible experience with service food is ok but you cannot dump on your customers and expect them to return never coming back would rather go to oda or pepella .
4 stars yay im a fan good authentic food great housetop 40s music and cute modern decor only one complain it was too dark that i could barely see my food while eating turning up the lights a bit is recommended .
time after time they screw up the order or it never shows up black listed for me .
food was excellent ordered the penang curry as my entree and it was the best id ever had flavor was packed full portion was adequate atmosphere is also nice waitress was rude and unfriendly however .
pizza is average definately no comparison to ny pizza dont bother w the wings barely any sauce n they just dont have flavor they were quick w delivery .
excellent quality of food very tasty and prepared very well i had delivery for lunch they lunch special size of food is a lot more that most send i would order again and delivery was fast .
sometimes the food and sometimes the food is bad sometimes the service is good sometimes the service is bad .
great space great food great service will definitely be back to try more of their menu i like that the decor is more modern than your usual thai fare .
tried this pizza on a recommendation the pizza was bland and had no flavor the mussels were not all that either although not the worst pizza there are alot of better pizzerias in the area .
brunch here all the time great brunch deal 8 for entree appetizer and thai ice tea .
skimpiest hot dog i have ever had my friends egg dish was cold by the time she got it maybe because it was brought from the basement wait what .
food fantastic atmosphere is loungey and class drinks are made well not watered down and service is on point defiantly coming back big time .
i have come here many times and have the exact same experience everytime extremely poor and barely respectful service and a 30 min wait to get a sandwich which arent bad but i cant wait for someone to open another sandwich shop in the hood .
love their pad see eiw with shrimps its so addicting ill def come back and try other things .
unfortunately this is the third time ive experienced this place not being open when their website said they were will most likely not try again anytime soon .
excellent thai food forget those other hells kitchen trendy restaurants go here the place is very mod but most importantly the food is excellent .
sandwiches are just ok the narrow space isnt very inviting or comfortable to sit in if you want a good sandwich in this neighborhood head over to saltie instead worth the extra dollar or two .
awesome decor vibe and space friendly staff and delicious food try the chicken or shrimp dumplings or seafood fried rice delicious would recommend this place for either inperson dining or delivery .
i only had the plain pizza so far the taste was just okay but the crust was super spongey which makes the pizza soggy and mushy .
good spot .
are you guys high this pizza was horrible the crust tasted like saltines the sauce had no flavor we ordered a large slice and after eating one slice each we threw the rest out and ate a bowl of cereal .
ordered from grubhub couple of days ago fast delivery delicious food i ordered lunch pad thai which is a great deal with 7 99 you can have one side and drink of your choice .
when you need slice this pizzeria will do spicy chicken pizza was a good option for people like me who like buffalo chicken however my son could resist the plain cheese pizza crust is nothing special kind of like the pizza you find in your grocery freezer .
cutesy place on 9th ave i got the beef pat see ewe with brown rice it was good what else can i say they have a cute lit up 9 sign by the front door hehe the food was good and at an average price .
they need to change their buffalo wings nachos and quesadillas they need to step their game up .
it is beautiful inside and the food is great .
two words food poisoning never coming back .
fantastic food the wait staff were so good the service was excellent thumbs up highly recommend .
the service sucked the waiter was rude and short and made a big deal out of me taking the wrong copy of my credit card receipt the food was okay but i would never go back due to the crappy service seriously avoid this place .
outstanding really enjoyable time love the lychee martinis and spring rolls great thai food and yummy appetizers lovely staff i asked for medium spicy and it was perfect relaxed and fun atmosphere looking forward to going back .
the biryani was not great the curries were okay i will give them some more time to settle down and hope their food gets better and consistent .
great place its a really nice place decor is greet and staff is really friendly prices are also great for manhattan pad thai is delicious .
below average pizza hard almost stale crust on both pies we ordered sauce and cheese were no better or worse than any other pizzeria around .
oh my this place was great the 9 peanut dumplings were fantastic my meat eater boyfriend couldnt believe they didnt have meat in them definitely start there im confident that the next thing you order will be perfect .
service is horrible plus the food isnt that great dont waste you time going .
good chicken dumplings and excellent pad khee mao the sauce was some of the best ive had on this standard thai dish .
well the meat was tasteless the cook forgot the wiz not worth the visit .
absolutely delicious great ambiance and service love the black light medallion ceiling quick correction on veggies omitted in an order made my own curry combo and they were totally accommodating great spices sophisticated seasoning beautiful food presentation i will be back yummy lychee martini .
jims steaks in west philly sucks their service and steaks are so miniscule i rather go to south street or cottman .
excellent service by far the nicest staff ive encountered in a while the food is incredible the restaurant decor is so beautiful i like this place .
i do not understand the enthusiastic reviews of this establishment a bad neighborhood combined with a greasy cheesesteak make for a totally forgettable experience extremely disappointing .
a small and weird japanese restaurant food is good i like their japanese curry its not spicy at all and i feel very full after eating that you can even enjoy the beautiful scenery of champlain lake while you are eating .
16 breakfast buffet is a must avoid looks great inside attached to marriot hotel but food and service leaves much to be desired .
best sushi ive had in btv and the service has finally improved to meet the quality of the food .
theres definitely a problem when regular customers are treated rudely while everyone is ivercharged ambiance does not make up for really poor customer sercivs this is one to avoid .
very good sushi and warm and friendly service the lake view is also amazing .
the cheapest tea they offer is around 3 25 pretty outrageous even for princeton .
very special place with unorthodox and fun menu and excellent service the place has a unique special design and very nice decor as well be sure to try out the selection of rolls and the chefs choice dish will surprise you .
really good food but the service tonight was terrible .
amazing sushi for a decent price must order volcano roll probably the best sushi roll ive ever had all the ingredients taste so fresh and the rice is absolutely amazing great service too definitely try it .
i was yesterday night for a good pizza but i have very bad experience w 20 years old manager what an asshole unbelieveble dont know how can he manage a nice and good place like that .
very fresh fish and innovative options beautiful open space near the lake nothing wrong with the service a real gem in burlington .
cosy romantic spot for drinks inside and outside nice to gather some friends out thats it the food here is a joke the pizzas are bland and too pricey definitely not worth it .
i just had the best french onion ive ever experienced in a restaurant the buffalo chicken sandwich was great too and the service was very charming i will be back at paulines cafe .
good food but the service is almost nonexistent after ordering took over 45 minutes for a blt and a salad .
i was pleasantly surprised by the quality of the selections here i had the salmon special and was blown away i would highly recommend a visit if youre in the burlington area .
i just saw the big c in the window the cleanliness rating that is a step above being shut down why am i not surprised .
i really enjoyed my food i had the open face turkey sandwich with cranberries cabot cheese so good service was also good we enjoyed our time there the fresh fruit served with my meal was excellent my husband had the curried beef he liked it quite a bit .
great food all the time horrible service 90 of the time the staff is probably some of the worst in all of new york city .
weve been to paulines half a dozen times during various visits to burlington and every time weve have a great meal and a great dining experience highly recommended .
this place is good for what it is the food is expensive and the dining experience is fine the food is not remarkably good and neither is the restaurant itself for me although if i needed a place that was tasteful and expensive this restaurant would be great .
while returning from vacation in camden me we stopped in burlington for the night someone recommended paulines cafe and it was outstanding four different dinners four delicious results highly recommended .
i think the manager and the dude who forever wears a hat and probably sleeps and showers in it and lets not forget about the bartender with the fake looking tattoo all need a massive attitude adjustment .
inlaws in town for christmas and we wanted a place that wasnt in the downtown area paulines was the answer great food and service would recommend to anyone wanting a cosy quiet dinner .
went one weekday night staff was rude ignored us and even after we were seated she seemed irritated to even be at work will not return to that atmosphere .
one of my grandmothers favorite spots they offer a good range of fresh tasty food for brunch lunch and dinner .
i just dont understand the hype cheesesteak is just fine bread is nothing special and the meat was tough and hard to chew was pretty disappointed as i have yet to find a great cheesesteak .
rainy day in burlington had french onion soup and caesar salad simple but very good great service .
they ran out of bread really went over to tony lukes where they had plenty of bread .
the best hamburger in the burlington area delicious local meat done to perfection yum .
place was closed when i showed up at 8 on friday the 23rd you want a good review you need to be open it didnt even have an explanation as to why they were closed i went two hours out of my way for this mediocrity .
we really enjoyed our meals here gourmet in style rich flavors and each meal tastes unique not like each other .
i came here on a friday at two my cheesesteak fix was a due shop was all closed with not even a sign no person in sight to explain why .
cant go wrong with anything that you order here beef skewers are my favorite thing ive been there for drinks and its just your average town bar .
very good tofu pot but services were not good we were forced to order more than we can eat ended up with a whole fish wasted as we were traveling prices are a bit high except for the hot pots 20 for bibimbap not again for us .
great place great staff an food is excellent all food is fresh mussels marina are so tastey specials are wonderful .
pricey for the portion size good flavor though but service also was pretty bad empty drinks all meal two of five with me got food 10min before the rest and finished eating before the food showed up not quite up to the 45 rating from 500 reviewers .
i thought the french onion soup was outstanding and the special of cajun shrimp and mozzarella over garlic bread was also delicious .
stomach ache after a one hour wait for a table is not my kind of place food was good but im not that experienced in traditional korean cuisine and pricey too .
great food good local bar service can be slow but its worth it try the house salad with mannys homemade dressing best ever .
it was just okay food tasted only okay surprised reviews rating is so high also kind of pricey .
chef sarah gresko has brought a taste of the south to hopewell nj staff is friendly the ambience is pleasant and the food is incredible cant wait until i make it back to try more of her incredible menu .
if they tell you to wait 25 min that means one hour and five for you to get a table and 25 mins to get the main dishes food is okay but not worth the time .
great bacon and cheese pizza hand tossed love this little gem they even have personal pizzas .
the side dishes were good the main entrees were underwhelming kalbi was especially disappointing and very little meat i seriously left hungry and that has never happened before at a korean restaurant go to madangsui next door much better food and awesomely priced .
better then most in the area .
not worth the wait or the hassle they want customers to pay for water owner is generally not focused on customer satisfaction was way better when in the burg not the same quality poor service way better options out there .
this is a restaurant that is diner themed i thought the food was delicious i had the lamb chops which were perfectly cooked and flavorful and the cauliflower mac and cheese i thought the mac and cheese could use more cheese but it was still good .
nice atmosphere just went for dessert and it was very disappointing the chocolate mousse is burnt and online menu is out dated bouncer was very rude and distrusting .
just randomly happened upon this place during a business trip to the area this place was full during lunch the service was great and the food was fresh definitely recommend .
in crowds only drinks and fried food please oy not on my diet or stomach .
the americana diner has rebranded itself as a fine diner along with eat better food so these low reviews for what it aint are stupid go enjoy a diverse menu and some good eats .
midtown is better this one was forgettable i dont even remember what i had there thats how forgettable it was midtown has better decor and food and menu .
one of the best around that i have been too weekends are always busy busy busy but the food is spectacular i love the irish omlet great for groups meetings if need to have them there very kid friendly .
expensive food and small portions .
the restaurant was terrific everyone enjoyed their meals and there is something for everyone service was excellent and everyone was very friendly ozzy was top notch the complimentary bread was awesome as well i recommend this place to everyone .
great ambiance but the prices are way too high for what you get .
my wife i went to americans because it was featured on americas best diners show on food network we were not disappointed .
ive been here several times and i think im done the prices are high for the quality and quantity the food is decent and the location and setting are great but there always a huge cramped cluster of people pushing through i like bustling not crowded elevator .
by far the best diner around classy upscale options as well as basic diner food all done with style very good service diners are part of living in new jersey like chasing girls when you find a good one you know it .
it had been a while since i had been here the prices seem to have gone up while the portions and menu have shrank there are certainly better places to go in olde city .
another great breakfast this time i had the cinnamon french toast with fresh bananas and strawberries bacon on the side perfection i tried some of my nephews hash awesome light but flavorful fresh squeezed oj too price cant be beat .
i had heard good things but did not love it we had a rude server who seemed too busy for us even though few people were in the restaurant midafternoon my order came incorrectly and i had to wait a loooong time to get a new salad .
cant lose here an excellent establishment that is flawlessly run and the menu changes very often always fresh ingredients bakery on premises ad pricing that is very reasonable .
why did the pirate pay 12 dollars for a martini because he loved giving money to stephen staaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa­aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa­aaaaaaaaaarrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr­rrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr ­ .
the rich grits is one of the best dishes ive eaten seafood spaghetti was perfection just enough to fill me with an incredible buttery garlic sauce .
ill go here occasionally because its convenient but the food is not that good if you want incredible vietnamese food try pho hong in burlington its actually worth the extra drive .
americana rounded up from 3 5 overall okay pretentious menu save the scallops for ramsey smaller menu win good eggs benedict secret menu does exist very pleasant staff .
atmosphere is at the bottom end of takeout asian which is not good my food was pretty lousy and my wifes literally had a cockroach under her main dish they handled it well by comping everything but still .
great service and good food better than typical diner fare just a touch more upscale enjoyed it and the dessert was super plum cobbler yum .
its gotten worse the staff is nice .
went on a sunday early dinner food was great and staff was friendly and attentive overall a great experience .
mollys is a dartmouth tradition and in that sense mollys does a great job the food however really leaves a lot to be desired .
best diner in the tri state area my son a cheeseburger nut says they are the best anywhere i may have to agree pretty much everything is absolutely amazing and the atmosphere is high end i really love this place .
i like the service but what the kitchen produces lacks substance and is reminiscent of friendlys for the price i cant give it a high review .
what a great diner clean great food and service also while diners usually have literally anything you want this place has more of a build your own type menu which i absolutely love since i usually amend menu items .
the service was slow the food was cold and the wait staff were eating instead of helping us the interior was too dark and kinda cluttered .
i brought my wife and child in this restaurant and it was an overall great experience the food tasted great and the atmosphere was welcoming i had the tuna dish which came out in a responsible amount of time will definitely be back .
what a change and not a good one staff is practically invisible spaghetti under cooked and watery meatballs would not eat in again stick to take out pizza .
great food i try to come here when visitng friends over this way .
dont eat here food is mediocre on a good day and the owner is a pompous arrogant jerk we will never eat here again with all the great foodie spots to dine at you would think the food would be better .
we love to stop here after work to unwind at their lounge the mixed drinks are yummy but lethal their bartenders know what theyre doing the food is awesome the servers are always attentive and know the menu .
pizza was decent really nothing special and their sub was tasteless and extremely dry it was a one time try because its in the area and family owned but i wouldnt go back .
just love this place even tough menu is smaller food and service is best in area for a dinner .
decent italian food pasta lacked a lot of seasoning but it wasnt too bad .
went there for breakfast it was awesome the french toast is somewhat lightly battered but tasty the pancakes are awesome the sausage was also good best of all was the carafe of freshly squeezed orange juice worth every penny .
expensive rude staff long waits and watery sauce on everything .
never disappoints not a true diner you wont find your basic diner items but you will enjoy the food .
service is painfully slow although the place is 34 empty post script the burgers were really good worth the long wait fresh cut fries would really up the score .
not your average dinner food and service is gourmet and upscale great atmosphere .
ordered take out and the garlic parmesan chicken was ok but the calamari fries were disgusting not nearly close to how described on the menu with no parmesan cheese as advertised .
excellent service fresh and tasty food very clean homemade marmalade delicious .
place is kind of a hole food is ok prices are good atmosphere kind of sucks to many college kids and bros dont even think about going on a weekend night .
very classy place bread is incredible many great food options .
theres a fight first thing when i came in halloween weekend maybe it was a fight club theme either way pretty ghetto the music was upbeat though .
love their omelettes excellent coffee and bread too fruit cup is always freshly cut yasmin and kianna warmly welcome you when you arrive and the entire staff is attentive and friendly try their light start for breakfasthealthy and tasty the americana is our favorite place for brunch .
i felt old and had never been so amused this is what i witnessed in ruben james nightlife an older woman dropping it like its hot someone leaving a 2 in the guys restroom sink people replicating the jersey shore .
exceptional diner think gourmet chef meets diner fare always consistent great creative breakfast and lunch selections .
we only hit up here for early drinks andor reggae nite lots of college kids but nothing special to right home about drinks are decent and the tunes on reggae night are right on point .
wonderful the food is wonderful fresh and the menu is updated often the prices are affordable they have online ordering that is easy to use i have yet to find a place that cares for not only their customers but the quality of food that they serve .
go for cheapfree wings and the beer and food specials eat and drink your fill and get out before ten after ten it tends to overflow with skanks and meatheads oops did i write that .
while its a little on the pricey side for diners the food does not disappoint i ordered a greek salad and the ingredients were pleasantly fresh the soup was also very delicious and tasted very fresh id love to return and try out more of the menu .
man it smelled so good but didnt deliver line was too long price is too high dough is too thick filling is too bland and grease is too abundant i think that sums it up .
its not on the menu but the bacon egg and cheese sandwichdelicious i also like how they leave the pitcher of coffee on the table .
do not eat here all these five stars are fake my girlfriend found a bug in her food .
everything i have ever ordered here has been fabulous i would suggest checking out the lounge dining totally different experience it has a romantic atmosphere and bring you warm homecooked bread with every meal they also have specials with wine .
waited an hour for delivery which wouldnt be a big deal if the meal wasnt a gelatinous mess of way overcooked pasta swimming in salty sauce ugh .
i have been coming here for years great place for breakfast lunch service and food quality is good but i do miss the mom pop quality back in the day talking about 15 years ago .
ate here once and thought it was ok so i ordered delivery from seamless but the lasagna was horrible not fresh the cauliflower was old and browning and the bread was stale absolutely awful never again .
i love the breakfast food and the lunch sandwiches you can not go wrong with a choizo omlette and a side of guac its the best way to start a day its really the best diner ive ever been to and thats a lot .
va beh was way better bread was stale olive oil was tasteless and my spaghetti was like ramen i go to italy all the time so i know what italian food is supposed to taste like obviously these people are cutting corners not recommended .
ive been going here for decades and love it i think they made a big mistake letting craig shelton mess with their classic diner menu i havent been back to see if its returned but have to say that you cannot go wrong with breakfast anytime of day .
worst pizza ever ordered a pepperoni pizza got a pizza with no cheese and no pepperoni when i called to ask they said they were out of pepperoni and sorry couldnt do anything about it .
americana has emerged as my favorite diner in the area westernstyle burger was great i was seated near the dessert case so i had to sample a cupcake for dessert it was just ok cant wait to go back and try one of their gigantic omelets .
the second star is for good service only we didnt even finish eating our pizza it was so bad cheese was rubbery crust was bland and toppings were mediocre its no wonder they make their pepper flakes so spicy its so you cant taste the pizza .
the is no better diner in nj .
waited 50 minutes for a well below average pizza just sayin .
great eclectic menu lots of stuff you would not find at your usual diner cool decor nice bar servers are attentive and polite cute waitresses a bit pricey though .
the owner has responded to my yelp review seven update 10 times he is insane i will never dine here again not even for the mediocre pizza .
good food all around have enjoyed breakfast lunch and dinner at this diner good reliable breakfast soups sandwiches and burgers .
the service was pretty bad the pizza was average what i really do not get is the owner responding to so many reviews seems sad when someone cannot accept feedback no need to bully .
fantastic place for breakfast food and service is excellent with reasonable prices what more could you ask for this place deserves a better rating .
stupid expensive only offer plain and pepperoni as normal slices no garlic salt oregano red pepper or parmesan went here once and will never go here again dumb dumb dumb .
incredible meal prices are high but worth it menu rotates constantly and dining room is tiny and intimate i would recommend this place to anyone .
the atmosphere does not make up for the terrible pizza .
really outstanding food and a cute interior waitress jo was a little cold but all in all a great dining experience very loud be ware if you are hearing impaired like my father and use a hearing aid .
one star for over priced pizza in no way is this pizza worth double the price i will pay more to support locally owned business but not at this level .
i was brought here for a work dinner last week its b y o b and the food is fantastic the salmon is some of the best ive never had service was very good i dont get to phila very often but will return here .
this was our 2nd visit and im afraid it turned out like our first close but no cigar im sorry but if im spending around 110 for dinner per couple with tip i want to be impressed i wasnt nor were the other two couples we were with .
best restaurant food and server were both amazing .
is very hard to get a hamburger wrong i ask for mayo and even that was charged to the account the meals are very small and the food is below average .
delicious food perfect portions wonderful ambiance .
burger was overcooked the burger was saved by throwing every topping possible on it i will be back to try this location again but for now its a 2 star food 4 star bar .
enjoyed a sunday evening tasting here the five course meal was delicious and had such range yet a southern theme started off with fried oysters and ended with a pecan pie although a bit pricey was up to expectations .
sadly each time weve been here the food has been just meh and the service less than stellar probably wont give it another go after the frequent failed attempts as much as i want to like this place given the cool atmosphere and location .
the sunday tasting menu is a fantastic bargain each dish while not spectacular was excellent and well worth the price .
this place would be great if servers kept up with the tables this place is trendy but lacking in service .
loved the food great restaurant with only a few tables i will be back .
went for lunch and it was not good i will never return update i went back it was still not good it was raining and we ducked in .
great food and even better service had the cobia dish which was cooked to perfection parking can be tricky so i ended up at the lot on south a few blocks away for 11 would definitely come back .
staff were kind but the elk meat was very tough and the pheasant sausage was kinda bland the watermelon ale on draft was lovely .
if i could go here every day of the week i would it is an amazing experience and i do get around the philly food scene you will experience flavors that you wont experience anywhere else and its byob ok there is no reason not to go .
not a great place for food or especially service the burgers are okay salads fair other than that yuk great place to watch planes take off and land on a nice day but dont let the food bring you here or the terrible service overpriced .
i loved this place it was amazing small little place small menu byobw that leaves you enjoying and craving more you can see the chefs cook the food and taste everything this place is off the beaten path but worth finding loved it .
horrible service found a hair in my food they brought out a new cheesesteak and salad but in reality used the same cheesesteak and put the salad in a bowl without the hair would not recommend this restaurant .
i am a fan little fish is actually quite little probably seats about 24 people cozy friendly atmosphere and great food oysters octopus and striped bass were all excellent octopus and the fish were both perfectly cooked food was interesting and delicious would return .
this place has only one thing going for them the view of the airport .
the sunday prix fix is worth every penny and for 33 a person its actually a very good deal 5 courses 2 hours i would recommend a particular dish but its totally chefs choice on sundays but worth it .
ehh its cute outside but nothing special the pizza tastes like old cardboard that was left out in the rain .
my favorite restaurant in philadelphia the menu is adventurous fresh and always changing pairings are exceptional and the ambiance is worth the price tag .
not what i expected even after a few visits prices too high for what they offer and quality of meals was marginal drink prices are too high for what this place really is more like a diner than what they are attempting to be not coming back .
tuna was effing amazing literally melts in your mouth tried cobia for the first time and my mind was blown i mean what the heck is cobia nevertheless i left very satisfied and with the knowledge that cobia is my new favorite fish .
avoid this place ordered cheeseburger with cup of chili both inedible chili was placed within a container and put in microwave burger was cooked well done even though i was never asked how i like my burger cooked .
35 four course prix fixe menu on sundays makes this byo an even better deal i love how he pairs melon with sashimi in the summer kampachi is my favorite fish get cobia if youve never had it before .
nothing special dirty and bathrooms were horrible good for a few guys getting a quick beer but nothing else .
fantastic hidden gem in philly i went here with two friends during a recent trip down to philadelphia what a nice surprise to discover this restaurant all the main dishes and appetizers are tasty we were pleasantly surprised how full we were after our seafood dinner as well .
cocos is a shabby sports bar the food is forgettable it should never have been in the philadelphia restaurant week listings the friend i invited along no longer trusts my judgement i felt very taken advantage of .
we went for the sunday tasting menu and everything was delicious great fresh seafood good service byob what more can you ask for .
wish i could give it 0 stars slow rude service and it is filthy avoid at all costs .
literally as good as it gets the best meal ill have all year truly a privilege to be able to eat such amazing food try it for yourself .
i wish there was another one close to me every time i go there its just bad service and rude people the black lady that helped me at the counter was the worst .
came here a few times for dinner and their food is excellent one of my favorite seafood restaurants only downfall is that the restaurant is a little too cramp when its busy .
mediocre pizza with bad service in the hour that we were there we had three different waiters and none of them were able to keep our drinks full or table clean pizza was okay service is bad .
would be a 5 but they have to do something about the air conditioning in the summer and their oysters are excellent but pricey otherwise wonderful seafood byob .
do not eat here it took one hour to bring out out food with the wait staff offering no information about what was going on lots of wait staff offering no service no one in the restaurant since it was an off peak time .
great little seafood restaurant looks like it seats 12 max if you are looking for something intimate and good seafood i highly recommend byob also .
food was ok i mean for the price cant really complain but as service goes that was terrible dont know how they operate like that it seems like either they dont have enough help or there servers just suck .
bacon scallops my god .
as a first timer i enjoyed the margherita pizza but it was not the best ive had the house salad had a white dressing that tasted weird the four cheese pizza left a lot to be desired the staff was friendly and professional however .
very impressed perfectly prepared great tasting memorable food definitely worth repeat visit .
pricey if you go for pizza though it offers more it will be 40 for two unless you get slices been there twice and the service was lousy both times but people tell me that they like the place do i give it a third try .
service was excellent dishes were good atmosphere comfortable and quaint .
tasty so dad never come here again the food is too oily fish is only salty it is chef course .
this is my favorite seafood place in center city you cant beat byob with a handwritten menu that includes the freshest and best tasting seafood in the area its tiny but romatic and cozy .
i agree with other comments below had restaurant week lunch and the chicken was like rubber could hardly cut it initial service was very slow why not do your best for restaurant week as most of us are trying different places to decide whether or not to return .
there a very few meals that leave with you that postcoital high this was one of them .
high price and small portions dont necessary make a place a luxury restaurant this is just an example nothing of what i tried impressed me .
little fish is an amazing experience ive been to a lot of good restaurants and this is the first time where i literally ordered every single item on the menu and enjoyed every last bite go here .
food was mediocre the service was horrible and they are overpriced then they added an 18 gratuity to our bill for three people .
the food here was very enjoyable we both loved it i went based just on the reviews it was small but clean im grateful the food was good because the server was a little rude i might go back .
service is outstanding 20 of a big bill will always get attention but the food is poor my scallops were the size of peas the steak had the consistency of rubber horrible experience way overpriced for what it claims .
great funky intimate spot marvelous seafood thats all fun to watch the chef and sous chef prepare good service .
the service was terrible the appetizers are so small and not so good the main dishes was really good the restaurant is pricy i will not comeback .
great fish and small intimate atmosphere if you like fish and a downtoearth feel for your restaurant little fish is a good pick .
too expensive for the quality the food is just ok .
everything was great nice very comfortable small place with very good service and great food .
had breakfast here so terrible the bacon was burnt and the scrambled eggs were just standard not even butter for the bread never again .
went tonight for the sunday dinner and wow is it a great deal food was excellent and well prepared best fried mussels ever wait staff could of been friendly dont miss it .
pretty place food portions so small steak dish wasnt even 4 oz fish dry wouldnt go back .
did the sunday tasting last night amazing food amazing service i dont usually care for mussels but i devoured a plateful in fact i think all four of us ate every morsel of food that was served to us really an ideal dining experience .
what didnt work for me atmosphere wasnt right prices should be lowered dishes recommended blue crab pasta a must have a bit spicy .
your back lets never fight again i missed you .
beautiful setting terrible food bad flavor served cold surly service nothing like marea .
small quaint place with excellent food love byobs so this place is perfect mussels in a coconut curry were delicious not too many cabs outside as we left so you might want to call one ahead of time overall little fish was delish .
good burger good vibe dont expect any love from the bartenders was there a few times with friends and drank aplenty at the bar they know not what a buyback is .
i havent been here but someone hoa t said they were closed i called and they recommend going to their other site fishphilly com not sure if the food is the same tho .
cash only packed not enough staff .
went back for the sunday dinner again i thought it was the same great but carrie liked it a lot more just because there was no sardine awesome awesome place .
note the staff here would like to make it clear that they are a bar with a food window as in they want you to understand that they are not a restaurant they should work on not being listed under restaurants then in my opinion .
seriously this place is nasty worst food ever dont come now it will be easier for me to get a reservation for the amazing 28 five course sunday night dinner .
bartenders are aloof to the point of being rude and completely ignoring you crowd is homogenous and boring .
absolutely phenomal we had the mussels coconut sauce and a fish dish that was terrific service was absolutely phenomenal cant wait to go back .
very slow service staff didnt quite seem to know what to do yet chicken was moist ribs were dry cinnamon and apples too sweet may try one more time .
must have a reservation really good lots o love in the food totally worth the price .
taste alright but expensive compare to portion of the food you are getting with same amount im spending here i would look for other food choice .
best seafood ive ever eaten mussels were delicious as was the tuna unfortunately the halibut was sold out so we couldnt try it but i guess that just means ill have to go again soon completely worth the trip .
big portions of fries they changed the hot dogs havent been to a jimmies in 10 years not the same hot dogs were awful .
tasty and charmingly tiny i could have used some more veggies on the entree though .
this place was terrible went for the view of the ocean when we were in town but we were completely disappointed fried clams were gritty french fries soggy and the fried calamari had absolutely zero seasoning this was a complete waste of money .
this cozy little byo never lets me down i can always expect to leave sated on deliciously prepared seafood their sunday prix fixe is always a pleaser if you suffer from agoraphobia avoid this gem at all costs otherwise expect a great meal would call ahead for reservations .
if you walk behind this restaurant smell it and still want to eat here you deserve the heartburn diarrhea jimmies will give you .
not only did little fish serve up the best seafood i have ever tasted but it is the best place i have eaten in all of philadelphia amazing dont forget byob and try the diver scallop appetizer .
just ok food but hands down the most disgusting bathroom i have ever seen in a restaurant it looked like someone intentionally spewed every gross thing you could think of and then left it there for a week or maybe a month one word ick .
have always had good meals here family favorite too .
not what it used to be for sure their lobster bisque is great though and i love the pictures of old savin rock but for the most part diner like food like this id rather go to pops restaurant in milford .
im not by any means a huge fan of seafood and this place is just a delight all of the ingredients are fresh and the fish is cooked to perfection cant wait to go back .
nice trendy atmosphere sushi isnt the greatest they didnt even roll it properly it was falling apart i have had better sushi else where not worth the price .
the food is absolutely excellent that staff is great and helpful the owner is a delightful person and works to create whatever your heart desires the pork and steak are amazing and they are always trying new variations on food and hot sauce dont pass this place up .
nice vibe good drinks the food was ok until they came and asked us to leave during our desert because we had been here for 2 hrs wtf .
good food fresh and tasty great bang for your buck portions are filling dining area is small and really clean will be back .
grocery store sushi and not even whole foods got food poisoning nough said .
the best comfort brunch this is your place when youre hungover and need a fatty skillet full of pork youll leave happy .
mediocre food upscale prices the sushi tastes fishy not fresh and the servings are not generous nice vibe pretty place to meet up for happy hour bar is nice decor is great more of a get together place than a great dinner place .
ive mostly only been here to drink but we got snacks every time the crawfish mac n cheese and the deviled eggs are so good also the atmosphere is friendly .
if i could not give any stars i would i have been going here for years and recently the staff had been soooo rude and out of line i cant even comment on the food dont waste your time there are better places to go .
amazing burger great service with cheap beers and i heard rapoza drinks here so it must be cool .
the 15 godzilla roll looks like a calfornia roll in fact we ordered 3 rolls in that price range and they were small what happened bus boy making the rolls wasnt like that the last time we were there although its been a while .
try the pigskins and the monicarita you wont regret it everything else we had was excellent as well why not 5 stars its just not a 5 star kinda place thats all its friendly its satisfying and it certainly quenches your thirst its a pub with great food .
full of fat gumbas gross .
its a great location peaceful environment havent eaten here yet however the bar selection is decent they have lonestar the blue ribbon of texas brunch everyday and good snack selection for late night cravings finally its important to have wifi and they do cheers .
expensive place nice setting poor quality sushi id suggest yamada sushi in rutherford instead .
awesome place great coffee by cafe grumpy great atmosphere and food .
im not sure about anyone else but the buffalo chicken sandwich gave both a girl and me a horrible stomach ache it was good but not worth the pain i had to go through .
get the chicken biscuit its so good the cajun burger is meh .
12 price sunday wing special and sports good times .
i came here once earlier this year late night our bartender was very friendly down to earth and just overall pleasant it was laid back and casual i must say i had way too much to drink and at 25 a shot i should of known better lol .
second visit soggy fries ok burger cajun fries very wrongly seasoned we will not return too much competition for our food dollar .
great place to relax enjoy a beer on a hot summer day love the outdoor seating and staff food is fantastic and prepared by some kick ass staff bloody marys are delicious and beer selection is better than most .
they had just opened and the staff and manager had no idea what they were doing we literally sat there for 35 minutes waiting to get served we eventually walked out .
update took my mom here 2 weeks ago and they have gf buns for the burgers score and an extra star for the fact that i can leave here at too full now .
ive been here oncenot sure if its worth my while to give this place a second opportunity the only person working there was apathy personified my food wasnt memorable just okay .
austin the bartender is making a robot out of an empty jameson bottle service is good music selection is good decent selection of whiskey why not come hither .
douchebag central bring back the tritone .
my favorite burger in the neighborhood with pickled onions and spicy mustard yum chicken biscuit is also good reasonably priced relaxed place always have a nice time here good bloody marys and nice bartenders too .
cambridge was awesome until they cut food portions in half but kept prices the same overall food quality has slipped too bad rip off .
came in here for happy hour today only 3 for narangasett on draft and its like 2 for a pbr or miller high life i think great crowd great bartenders great for getting some writing or reading done love this place .
great service slow kitchen servers were polite and very welcoming which was needed to make up for the huge wait time to get our food when it finally came is was ok but not worth the wait .
i love heavy woods this is a regular spot for me from the food from tchoup shop to the best micheladas ever also a big fan of the coyote shot .
i usually get rigatoni vodka which is delicious today tried spaghetti with meatball and sausage it tasted like they made it yesterday and reheated it definitely taking a break from romeos for a while aljons and brothers is much better .
went here for brunch i had something thats basically an open reuben sandwich with eggs benedict on top i e toasted rye with corned beef and swiss sauerkraut pickles poached eggs and hollandaise basically the best thing ive had to eat in at least a year .
this place is straight up garbage i got a chicken parm hero and didnt even finish it and i never waste food there were only a few strips of dried out chicken in my hero i was so pissed that i lost my appetite .
cute friendly staff creative food options .
i got the gyro platter for lunch which was dry uninspired and nothing like a deconstructed gyro worst of all it came with vegetables which looked more like poop tasted that way too there are better places in fairmount for lunch and they wont serve you poop either .
good fare fairly priced kind service had the duck okra gumbodo get the biscuit on the side hard to tell by the menu if some items are entrees or snacks but at 20 i left feeling satisfied so thats that .
i was disappointed when i went here for dinner on friday night the food was just mediocre and the service slow i did sit outside which probably accounts for the slow service still i was hoping for better .
the best little gem in town the drinks and bartenders are amazing one word for you mandy shes too cute .
nothing that special food is mediocre and overrated went once and said never again .
heavy woods is a great bar with new orleans style small plates the drinks are reasonably priced and they have a large selection pale ales they serve the food on camping dishware the atmosphere is relaxing the lighting is dark and they have a great music selection .
its been a while since i ordered delivery from here i use to order here a couple times a week the portion size of the meat platter shrunk to 12 definitely not worth 17 now very disappointed .
bar cafe thats cozy and just the right amount of chill perfect when uncrowded .
meh food was ok place is cheaply decorated and not as appealing .
i unexpectedly had a pretty darn good meal here both of the po boys were excellent it was nice that they have ample outdoor seating its a nice low key hangout when the weather is good all of that and friendly staff means ill be back .
i dont know if its just me but pricey is what i felt after not being impressed like i expected 2 meat combo chicken and lamb over spiced and dry it tasted like it was reheated not really interested in trying twice .
five stars for the food ten stars for the beer this is an awesome addition to bushwick always good times .
the staff is friendly but the food isnt great i went there twice to give them a second chance but it was the same to make matters worse they prepared one of my foods with the use of a microwave 2 stars because the staff is friendly .
isabels irish coffee best thing ever tastes like unicorns riding the grand terrains of happiness to never never land coming back for this once again tastes like a coffee bean unicorn and jameson also their chicken biscuit is a deity actually all hail the biscuit of chicken .
i have one word for this place disgusting the meat that i ordered looked like somebody chewed it and threw up gross never going back .
amazing food also a really cool bar over hear in bushwick crunchy pork bellies catfish poboy grass fed burger they did for me noncajun style was off the chain .
ill give it a 2 star for the sangria cause the leche de tigre was terrible the jalea was too small .
the fact i an sit back and get an amazing coffee followed by an amazing beer all why getting some work done on their free wifi is amazing cool vibe and cool people the cherry on top of it all was the bald bartenderbaristas amazing music taste .
i dont get what all the hype is about this place their empanadas are mediocre at best the chicken in my empanada was still raw the beef empanada was ok i was not impressed my moms are better .
love this bar super chill always a spot available either at the bar or a table sick cocktails bartenders are always nice good pours on wine .
i was looking forward to going to stellas empanadas for the longest especially after seeing the yelp reviews i was so disappointed with the food i was really expecting authentic argentinian food and got american empanadas .
cool little bar laid back somewhat limited food menu but what it does have is done well very good poboys great addition to its section of bushwick .
good pizza terrible service after 35 min waiter came back said they lost our order oye vey .
awesome place day or night .
soggy delivery and really bland flavors ill take pix underground over this place any day .
im not often in bushwick during the day but i thought this was the perfect spot i love bars that also serve great coffee this place has a cool vibe and has plenty of space for working on your laptop .
rudest hostess saw her snap at several people in line luckily a nice gentleman seated my party the chicken sandwiches were awful it had no flavor at all and was strangely sweet .
this place is so cute i prefer coming here on a week night during the day is a perfect spot to drink coffee and kiki with the girls on wifi .
blah what crappy service took forever to get our drinks and the pizza was not memorable in fact i cant recall what i had probably the margherita hate when i am basically ignored and dont get my wine before the food .
awesome spot bartenders are super attentive and suggested beers that i may like based on previous orders im hoping to become a regular .
check your bill i ordered a classic pizza with two toppings by phone and they overcharged me 4 dollars hoping that i would not notice what a fucking ripoff .
love the mulled cider love sitting by the windows love the atmosphere and ross is a super nice bartender i need to go durring the day for coffeebrunch time another great bar by the jefferson stop .
the 1 star is for inconsistency with delivery its hit or miss and today it was a huge miss when they hit it isnt bad pizza but is it worth the chance of a ruined lunch no .
great spot comfortable nonpretentious inexpensive good music and youre made to feel welcome alex one of the bartenders is a total charm plus he makes some killer bloody marys kitchens supposed to be opening up in a couple of weeks so that should be an added draw .
4 stars nooo this place does not warrant 4 stars at all the pizza was edible nothing spectacular with all the amazing pizza places in ny this place does not even rank .
great new bar they really did a great job with the design and they bartenders are very friendly great addition to the neighborhood .
these people are jerks i called for a reservation to take my office to lunch and they wouldnt take my reservation or even let me talk to the manager it seems like a dumb business idea since i would have been spending hundreds and hundreds of dollars .
worth your time clean friendly great beer and scotch selection stopped there for a prebrithday celebration and left totally bonked because the bartender is a great guy and knows how to serve a bday drank lineup .
i dont know why people in my firm keep ordering pizza from this place the stuff is salty the toppings are not very generous the combinations unadventurous and boring the dough is too thick for my taste at least and its kinda expensive .
5 pints with all good beer on tap and the rustic wooden bar is enough for me to give a place 5 stars the bar staff is great and the place gets full pretty quickly and has little seating but i dig it .
mediocre pizza and horrible attitude by manager he was indifferent to the waitress bringing out the wrong food which i was allergic too would not go back .
great food and drinks pricing reasonable and atmosphere is great place nicely decorated too .
i used to think this place was ok but not worthy of all the best pizza in nyc accolades then i found hair baked into my pizza crust hair disgusting never ever eating adriennes again .
there are some very good authentic mexican dishes mixed in with your typical texmex fare the help is inviting and attentive the mole and fish dishes are very good great decor and we like the alcoves scattered around the restaurant consistent and inexpensive worth visiting .
its over rated the atmosphere is pretty good compared to a normal nyc pizza place but i would pick pizza italia any day of the week .
havent been here in a while the outside of the restaurant is not so appealing however the inside is very clean and festive the staff is great it gets a good crowd and the food was great .
too greasy not very fresh tasting mind you we got it delivered so it may not be 100 fair .
this place was crazy inside with trippy murals food was tasty and service was outstanding they offered us complimentary shots and desserts cant argue with that great place .
decent designer pizza given the prices good service at the tables but if you do take out you feel like an annoyance to them very surly at the counter ill stick to the neikghborhood pizza guys .
have been eating here for years love the food and atmosphere .
weird decor for a lake side location food was ok not good staff was friendly need to work out some kinks before i decide to ever go back .
this hole in the wall is the best place for breakfast in rahway great sandwiches compared to all the places ive tried nearby and the staff is sweet .
very bad experience the waiters always chatting with each other never refill my water i also found a bug inside my steam seafood pot this is the worse korean restaurant ever dont go .
this is the best spot in rahway nj for breakfast the place is small and cozy the staff is very friendly also .
i tried really hard to like this place i thought the idea of seeing food cook in front of me was cool it wasnt that great i didnt like having to cook my own food and almost got burnt preparing it .
this place is absolutely wonderful great food great prices and most importantly fantastic coffee service is fast and polite and the food is great if you want a good fast meal at a good price this is the place to get it .
not bad .
cozy and old school inside the prices food and service are all great make sure you bring cash .
pros bad service cons smokey .
very good food very big portions at a fantastic price been here a 100 times for the price you can not beat it .
interesting place but i think you really have to be korean to appreciate this place .
food comes out hot got to love good coffee .
cooking the live octopus by placing the octopus on top and not fully immersing it in the pot is like torture if its going to die let it die faster having it die slowly is like slowly being burned to death .
ive been here many many times i absolutely love this place they have good portions for a good price my favorite dish is the chicken francese best on the island .
the owner is a nasty women shes extremely rude and doesnt know how to speak to customers i regret ever giving her business .
great food and a fun atmosphere cant wait to go back with the fam food was amazing i wish i could give it 10 stars .
ordered a pie for delivery and the crust was charred black to the point we couldnt eat it i dont know how this place has any good reviews based on the pizza they served us i will not be ordering from this place again .
robyn the bartender is the best i only come here for her its a great deal for brunch too if your idea of brunch is leaving wasted which lets be real it is .
ehhhh came here because of all the reviews wine tasted funny found a hair in my salad limited menu would not suggest this place for dinner maybe brunch is better really not sure .
i love this restaurant they have great food that is reasonably priced there is always a crowd when they have bands it is always a great band a great place to eat and relax with friends .
eh thats all i felt when i left oysters were good but the two entrees we had were uninspired dull great vibe cocktails .
the summer burger is the best burger you will ever have .
this buffet is horrible its the worst ive ever been to food is disgusting if you are looking for crab legs dont come here one of the only chinese buffets that doesnt have them very disappointed with this place .
not what i expected our open faced ruben was pretty good kinda weird as they had 80s rock on the speakers and a fine diningish atmosphere .
undercooked pancakes cold ham mediocre coffee nothing about this place justifies its high prices go to any number of places in the hood as an alternative .
one of my favorite north shore restaurants food is consistently good and the staff is friendly dinner specials are a good deal .
had the eggs benedict and my friend had the quiche both were below average for new york total bill was 60 including 2 teas and tip definitely overpriced given the below average quality wont go back and would not recommend .
excellent food wonderful cuisine have eaten dinner there and their brunch is fabulous reasonably priced .
overpriced great atmosphere and service but the food was marginal you can do better for 60 for two people .
i stopped in hearing that one of my favorite breweries were on tap what a beautiful bar attentive staff great service even a free cheese plate with yelp checkin oh and music list too we will be back .
food looked good but 20 for eggs bacon and toast sorry too much for me to spend on a simple meal .
service food was excellent may try to go back for the double burger before we leave melt in your mouth .
if you dont mind spending a kings ransom for huevos rancheros pancakes no waffles im afraid you may think youre very hip when you go here if you do mind i do then pass its fine but not that great frankly i would rather go to fairways upstairs .
loved this place we tried a dish called fiddleheads for the first time they were excellent i loved the fact they give you a free cheese board with a yelp checkin if i return to vermont i will definitely go back to the bluebird .
1 told waiter of food allergies but he brought something that would have made me sick anyway then was rude about it 2 flies .
the drinks are divine youll drink yourself silly and poor here the concoctions are delectable and heady the food is juicy and bursting with flavor havent had a bad experience yet .
ive been here 3 times now and sadly i think im going to stop returning the breakfast options are just not that great the burger is bland perhaps i must be picking the wrong items but im not convinced anymore sadly looking for new options now .
always exceptional service professional without being stuffy the food is outstanding across the board .
good food terrible service .
i cant wait to try their new burlington venue about the food i had at their old locationi can only exclaim and make nummy sounds a little spendier than im used to i go to satisfy a craving for something different or to celebrate .
drinks are good food is average .
i have been a sampler of vermont food for three years and bluebird taverns double burger is hands down the best burger in vermont .
awful today wrong order twice sharp plastic in my salad disinterested manager never going back i brought my parents and i was totally embarrassed .
great cocktails very competent and friendly staff oysters go there .
one word overpriced got the abraham lincoln was good but not worth the price my wife and i could have gotten better food at less than half the price at the local diner right across the street from where we live skip it leave it to the hipsters .
food was local and tasty great summer ambience so wish wed had the cheese board i had the burger which was great but not over the top the waitstaff was incredibly kind they really added to the experience .
food was overpriced and mediocre at best had the chorizo and shrimp mess which came with burnt toast sausage was not chorizo more like breakfast sausage was not worth the 24 cash only .
good food fast delivery but i think thats not the number 9736772222 nice customer service .
the food wasnt great overpriced and to top it off the delivery man took way too long and was extremely rude when he showed up he looked disheveled and dirty and threw the food onto the desk complained about the tip .
i love crowns amazing food as a college student i am hungry at late times and they are usually open till 3 am which is amazing their food is cheap and tastes amazing .
been here 25 minutes finally got acknowledged took a further 15 to be asked if i wanted to order something i ordered decaf coffee and they have non how can a breakfast restaurant not have decaf its only half full at 8 30am i can see why .
loved this little greasy spoon tucked away in an apartment complex right next to the perelman museum classic breakfast foods as well as bagels and lox and deli sandwiches quick and thrifty i had a tuna melt and it could be split .
i love bbq but here the bbq was just ok the nachos were very good but you can get good nachos anywhere the pies were good i wouldnt ask my friends to go back here .
i love this place it is where all my friends and i get together for breakfastlunch and even dinner the food is true diner food and fresh they deliver and are good to their customers .
went for brunch and after a long wait got the huevos rancheros fine but unimpressive service was decent yet spotty couldnt locate our waiter to order dessert the red velvet cupcake however was exceedingly delicious .
spinach omelets are great anytime but dont pass on the special salads with fresh hand carved turkey or the hand made cheeseburgers cooked to order no frozen patties here .
just had dinner here with my wife and thought the food was ok but a little greasy .
simple delicious inexpensive breakfast food i went on a friday after an appointment in the area and was delighted to find that the breakfast special on fridays is scrapple eggs i was sold .
way overpriced biscuit was great and food overall was fine but definitely not worth the prices .
great nostalgic diner but not of the annoying 50s variety it has a 70s tom waits vibe the food was great and the service is wonderful sit at the counter the fruit salad is the best ive ever had at a breakfast joint .
crap service average food slow to come and overpriced for what it is bubbys owes its existence to the lack of midrange restaurants in tribeca id suggest landmarc instead .
the food is consistant and they are always open philly needs more of this eggs cheesteaks etc .
decor comfy food humdrum prices scandalous 19 000 restaurants on this island do yourself a favor and walk past this one .
waitresses were nice even if they looked like they got dressed in the 90s and didnt care that the world changed p food was ok prices were decent maybe good for a hangover cure i have since changed my mind the monte cristo is worth it .
i enjoy the bubbys in brooklyn and the menu items are pretty similar to tribeca however i thought the food was definitely overpriced 18 for breakfast not including coffeedrinks was a bit too much the food was good but nothing to write home about .
excellent food i had eggs benedict best ive ever had the eggs were cooked perfectly the hollandaise sp delicious we certainly will return here for breakfast next time were in philly the prices are outstanding as well perfect breakfast spot .
mediocre food way overpriced pretentious too loud to have a normal conversation 30 000 restaurants in nyc you can do better easily .
great diner fast friendly service authentic local clientele and delicious food dont bother walking around to find something better in the neighborhood like we did it doesnt exist .
this place was so so .
just what youd expect from a greasy spoon diner good cheap breakfast and fast service .
i had lunch there it was just okay the pie was very good .
just go and enjoy great service good comfort diner food what else can you ask for .
food was one notch above terrible our foursome all had different items meatloaf included and the only decent thing were the rolls uck such a disappointment .
everyone knows to go here for breakfast its obvious need i say more or whate anyone else has said .
this place is overrated overpriced and overhipsterified just because they give your kids balloons and they have a photo booth in the basement doesnt mean its worth the visit .
love it every single thing was delicious we had chicken kabob platter chicken shawarma platter and the supreme middle eastern combo which is a little taste of everything hummus tabbouleh grape leaves and falafel everything was excellent we cleaned all the plates highly recommend .
a little over priced typical steaks good sides large desserts portion size .
this place is amazing my husband and i tried it for the first time and we loved every bite the servers were great too .
this was our second time coming here and this time the service was very slow and food nothing special at all especially at the prices they are charging the steaks were not cooked correctly and did i mention the slow service definitely would not go back .
the food and service was great will be dining here again soon the hummus was delicious and the beef kebabs were on point .
highlights large portion of red snapper entree well seared crispy skin well salted shortcomings everything else was bland an amorphous green foamsauce fingerling potatoes some sort of fried garnish even the rolls were stale overpriced due to its proximity to bumblef the bartender was very nice .
im really surprised at all of the hohum reviews for this place the food is great i recommend the tabbouleh and hummus with meat fantastic the service is slow so call ahead or pack your patience its worth the wait .
i dont like this place at all their pizza sucks they were good many years ago but not anymore .
sahara grill is very delicious and the food is of great quality the prices are fair as well as the portions i recommend you come when you want a great meal .
ive only been here once and not again since i cannot believe how salty the food is here granted i only tried a pasta dish but i cant say im interested in trying anything else because of the salt content .
hands down the best middle eastern food in philly the creamy hummus is amazing and the lamb schawarmas are to die for i absolutely love this place and eat there one a week .
mediocre chinese takeout i ordered the general tsos chicken while i was surprised at the good quality of the chicken itself it was not very flavorful .
very good if youre in the mood for middle eastern i wouldnt say it wowed me but it was fresh fast and delicious .
my very first italian hot dog ever ordered the single combo which is 1 dog and 1 sausage with the works a bit messy but unique cheap prices loved the old school set up inside and wanted to love the food however my stomach couldnt handle the grease .
by far my favorite restaurant in the city you must get the middle eastern combo platter .
this place have been here 4ever its still greesy pizza still sucks bread still just ok but the hot dogs fries keep this joint making money service is not the best but its consistent .
solid service delicious food i tend to get the zucchini and feta platter i can never finish it but i prefer it over the sandwich because the hummus that comes with it is excellent i was there today and i might have to go back for lunch tomorrow .
never again .
all of the dishes here are delicious prepared well and the ingredients are fresh every time i come i order something different and im always pleased with my meal the service is quick and friendly too .
fresh healthy ingredients however not authentic bi bim bap if you want authentic korean food try out seoul bbq in new britain .
i lived in philadelphia for five years this place has the best hummus they always have fresh mint tea the service is quick and good baklava is amazing sweet rich yet light .
do not waist your time money or appetite on this place the rice was gloppy and the food was tasteless 1 star is generous .
plain decor but great food .
please note i have nothing against the people at the restaurant they are nice people it is something that i observed that is disturbing i am not trying to be funny i am being real .
this place is so delicious its the best grilled chicked greek salad i ever had the cooks are seasoning masters everything we order is seasoned to perfection i eat from this place every chance i get definitely a must try .
there is nothing to boast less make a testament about the food es simply disgusting and detestable but however the decor is nice .
this is our go to place for fresh lebanese food the best dish on the menu is actually several the combination of appetizers and grilled meats its about 50 for 2 people but so worth it the yogurt drinks are also very good .
do not go here unless u have a reservation we waited 2 hours and still didnt get seated i wish they would just told us there wasnt any tables available .
fresh food with lot of choice price is ok and cofee was just excellent .
its overrated the food is nothing special but the location is amazing the atmosphere is nice but the attitude of the staff makes me never to dine there again the food is mediocre have had much better nothing special but i guess try for yourself and find out .
dropped in for a weekday lunch service was a bit shaky but the falafel sandwich ranked up there with some of the best in the city and the hummus with a touch of lemon was sublime prices were reasonable as well .
i am easy going obviously i am about to be far from easy the food is not good the view is spectacular service is meh and they have way too many rules regarding attire and menu schedule pass .
excellent value and location food was very tasty never crowded definitely returning .
no bueno waited 2 hours 10ppl and we got charged 700 no liquor lol it was a crazy experience and what makes it even crazier is that my co worker owns the building .
4 6 stars the hummus was very smooth and tasted fresh it may have been the best i have ever had the chicken shish kabob was wellseasoned and perfectly cooked the spicy lentil soup was quite good my friends shwarma was dry and the baklava was small .
the worst place ever waste of manager extremely rude long wait with reservations made no accommodations according to the manager and chef they could not substitute rice for fries because of extra work never again .
short sweet i go to this place once a week my favs are the chicken salad and the falafel platter i dont go for the service or ambiance which is just ehfine but yummy all the same .
we wanted to have a coffee outside and they told us it was only for eating not for coffee we had to go to the bar for coffee not nice .
my staple has always been the couscous lamb get it .
as locals weve tried the place twice and really wanted to make monument lane one of our regular dinner places sadly the food and especially the service have been disappointing one star .
really amazing mediterranean food i loved the chicken shish kabob ask for the green sauce on the side if you like spicy and you wont be sorry .
given this place multiple chances but it just sucks the staff is slow and rude last night i went and the waiter reached over my plate rolled his eyes when i asked a question and then scoffed at his tip unreal .
the hummus here is really very good i tasted the first falafel i have ever had in my life here and it was pretty darn good i would love to come back here again if i get a chance .
i was excited to get over to monument lane it looked so cozy and delicious really sad to say i stopped in alone tonight and was treated so rudely by the bartender that i left maybe ill give it another shot at a table and not alone sometime .
its nice to be able to get takeout from such a nice restaurant the food is consistently yummy fresh and my sandwiches never completely fall apart while im enjoying them everyone is friendly and the decor is very pleasant and relaxing .
i went here a few weeks ago with my parents and i distinctly remember thinking this food is just ehh nothing more nothing less and for the price it was more towards the eh bad scale the drinks were good and inventive i wouldnt go back .
baba ganoush and shish taounk were delicious .
had a brunch there eggs with bolognese dish was pretty awful greasy the eggs were overcooked for this dish the pancake was pretty bad too the arugula salad was not that fresh either just ate a little and left too bad really wanted to like it .
fresh tasty and very good restrooms need better cleaning and a new paint job .
flatbreads are soggy flatbreads differentiate from pizza because the crunch this thing was as crunchy as soup .
amazing food and great service i highly recommend the mixed appetizer platter of baba ghanouj hummus tabouleh and marinated mushrooms and eggplant everything is fresh and very flavorful very attentive staff is cheerful and happy to cater to your requests love this place .
ive tried giving this spot a chance a few times because its so close to my work its mediocre at best the pasta dishes ive tried have been too salty to finish and the salads are overpriced for what is served .
rating 4 5 stars cost adjusted review for what we paid dinner was really good we had great appetizers and the kebabs for main course were a pleasure the decor is a bit shabby so dont use this place to impress a date otherwise good option byob .
came here for the first time since they were offering a groupon discount i was pretty disappointed their food is bland not like authentic thai food at all also its street parking only which is hard to come by on bloomfield ave .
delicious falafel hummus babaganouj etc i havent found falafel i like so much anywhere else and the prices are really good too service on the other hand is pretty bad but having grown up in philadelphia i dont really mind .
no egg no salt no oil no taste actually a strange taste not worth the ride to get them at 10 a bakers dozen it make it the most expensive ive ever purchased located in burlington vt .
i ordered the grilled lamb dinner and liked everything the salad and grilled vegetables tasted like they were straight from the farmers market the lamb was perfect and i loved the iced tea nice arabic music too when can i come back .
this is a neat little place at a great location but the bar tenders are the worst in the city their lack of attention to customers could only be matched by complete ignorance food looks good and i cant comment on wait staff .
very delicious and healthy food a little bit expensive but what do you expect for a restaurant in center city the owners are friendly and so are the waitresses and the chefs i really like everybody there and feel home when get into the restaurants .
this rooster is not happy and not friendly and this rooster has ridiculous expectations for drink prices get a bartender who smiles yikes .
i have been to the sahara grill two times the first time i had the shwarma and the second time i had the falafel with hummus both were good thoroughly filling and under 8 00 .
food was so badly prepared slopped on a plate burger was 13 the size of the bun waitress didnt even bring a glass for expensive beers and the booths are so low to the ground and so uncomfortable we couldnt get out of there fast enough .
so impressed this place has the best dolmas i have ever tasted perfectly balanced mint and creamy rice and serve delicious food all around i have only tried their vegetarian options so cant speak for their meats .
food was pretty good especially the buffalo shrimp however the waitress had major attitude perhaps because we asked to simply fix the wobbly table and didnt want to sit next to a smokers table for this reason stay away there are better places with nicer staff .
this place is solid atmosphere is weird and quiet but the food is great tastes fresh comes out quickly i wouldnt say i know a ton about middle eastern cuisine but this seems to be authentic try their special iced tea its good .
we just went for drinks on a saturday night service was poor drinks were overpriced and we got overcharged they had one bartender regina i believe and they were swamped womp womp .
i really like coming here when i want some sit down middle eastern near my apt the food is fresh tasty and never disappointing never had a problem with service either itll continue to be a place i frequent .
bad news order wrong steak cooked noisy place filled loud drunks nice waitress though and good onion rings .
great hummus baba ganoush and falafel went there with family a while ago its convenient a block off broadway near shopping and the arts and inside its clean with good food at a reasonable price definitely worth the time and money ill go back .
okay local dive bar .
good selection easy location decent prize whats to complain about seems like a great place for vegetarians even unintentional ones i ordered a beef kabob wrap and struggled to get through the whole salad that had also been crammed in with .
they dont deliver nuff said .
great service great food great prices totally unfussy quick and delish love it ps the waiter here is a hottie .
got take out ive had much better and paid much less .
i have never had a bad experience here i mean common its a buffet obviously some stuff that has been sitting for a bit isnt perfect but for the price and all you can eat i would choose this place over any other chineese place around any day .
ordered the italian wedding soup the menu pictured showed a large bowl of soup with lots of escarole white beans and 8 meatballs they brought me a small covered ramekin with three meatballs and five white beans i counted total rip off .
sunrise buffet really deserves more stars it is hard to find cheap food in this small town for 10 buffet i think the food is quite decent ive never suffered any symptoms of food poisoning after dining there and the food is actually served at a good temperature .
the place looks decent but the food was definitely not great we ordered the indochinese appetizers and punjabi food and it was upto the mark i will not recommend this place .
not bad for a small town worth the money i went for lunch once a week dinner once in a while .
really hit or miss first time there my husband and i thought it was decent enough to go back 2nd time the food was terrible 3rd time was forgettable much better options in the area .
not just for hipsters margaritas are a must by the pitcher go for the special of the day or mahi tacos are a standard .
i am a regulr and i expect high standards but i was dissapointed i ordered a chicken afghani to go and it was salty as if i was drinking sea water all the hopes of me eating a good hicken dish was wasted .
this place is outstanding goat tacos the bomb awesome patio mucho margaritas great salsas fantastic menu great brunch menu i highly recommend this establishment .
i ordered a large hot pastrommi sub what i got was a cold one and they wouldnt replace it .
one of my favorite places in the city for mexican their good is delicious and their margaritas are amazing definitely a must if your in the mood for mexican .
quality control inconsistencies may loose you customers when the food is made right it is delicious when it is made wrong waste of money also a ham an cheese sandwich on wheat bread should not cost 9 50 .
we had a great experience eating at the bar this is the sister restaurant to cantina dos segundos in northern liberties we love the vegan fajitas and the bottomless bowls of chips and salsa .
will never go back my favorite bartender is gone now off to a better job service sucks this is a 50 club anyway not a helpful place strange atmosphere do not recommend this place to anyone i hesitate giving one star .
so delicious great service great atmosphere and good people the food was excellent margaritas were delicious and great quality highly recommend the vegetable burrito and chicken quesadilla guacamole and salsa excellent as well .
very disappointing ordered a rare burger which came out well done and dry they seemed reluctant to make us new burgers the manager came over and i felt that he didnt care that the food was not being cooked correctly will not be going back .
great atmosphere love coming here during the day or at night to hang out with friends at the outdoor seating area they almost always have a long wait but its worth it for the chicken nachos and the margaritas .
ok great beer and the prices are good the chicken wings are soso get the california burger if you want to see the worlds thinest slice of avacado .
this is my favorite place in philly for margaritas they often are crowded and the seats area little close together so dont go expecting a lot of personal space but the food and drinks are excellent and reasonably priced i also really love the weekend brunch .
overpriced meat you can buy the same amount of meat with half of the price from shoprite or any other local stores .
hands down the best mexican i have ever had east of the mississippi eat your heart out rick bayless .
probably the worst chicken gyro ever i think i may have food poisoning ick .
after a long friday night i always look foward to brunch at cantina their brunch on a warm saturday morning drowned in a blissful combo of margaritas and mojitos is absolutely perfect .
menu is stuck in the 1950s they need to have a credit card machine and better seating .
a cool place my amigos i go all tha time i love tha margaritas frozen or traditional tha fajitas r great the servers r cool also i highly recommend this place .
how come when i got my eggplant parm sub home it turned out not to have any cheese on it disappointed .
fantastic nachos cool vibe environment i love it here their nachos are worth traveling to and their margaritas as sneaky at getting you druuuunk the oozing cheese and loads of generous toppings makes for a solid meal .
can do better elsewhere the pizza was lukewarm when served and the crust was soggy nice people there but they need to improve especially considering the stiff competition in new jersey .
great food especially if youre looking for a vegan or vegetarian option and pretty good drinks sadly everyone else knows it there was a 45 minute wait on a friday night no food is good enough for a wait longer than half an hour still mighty tasty .
i ordered stuffed shells from the menu for 8 95 when i was given the bill they were 12 95 they werent worth it i will never go back when l asked about the price the owner said well we have to wash the dishes .
great place for fun casual mexican texmex food margaritas are great and the chips keep flowing check out their daily specials board too brunch is the best though chorizo breakfast burrito and huevos rancheros .
cheap beer good selection bartenders were ok one guy was friendly the other one went ballistic at me for some reason crazy .
this is an awesome spot its located right by my apartment so if i decide last minute that i want to go out this is my go to place margs are great and theres a good selection of beer i love any dish with goat in it .
ah so this is a real jersey dive yup crowded with plenty of townies grinding to loud hiphop with the sounds of incoherent shouting and shattering beer bottles mixed in not a bad spot if thats the type of mood youre in .
good margs .
nice atmosphere but after sitting down for 15 minutes when it was moderately busy i was not approach by a server had a craving for some pizza while here for business .
favorite burrito in the city .
bland pizza slow service and overpriced drinks i really dont understand what others see in this place the wait staff seems more interested in each other than in their customers could put up with that if the food had any taste .
this place is awesome great burritos great drinks great staff .
not sure about the food called to make a reservation and they were rude and hung up on me they should consider accepting online reservations with that attitude .
awesome place to hangout and get food and the margarita pitchers are where its at the guacamole is good too .
the service of custumers is very shit .
very cool place with great specials nightly and fun margaritas they had a blueberry special when we went as well as tacos al pastor with cactus the bartender was not the greatest but food was great .
delivery was an ordeal and they kept missing us but what really rubbed us wrong was price 130 for four large only 12 inches pizzas with one topping max and a handful of sodas super overpriced for mediocre quality quantity and delivery .
my boyfriend and i love this place we go there all the time great tacos the chorizo tacos are my favorite and fantastic margaritas its a great friday night date place .
spongy crust sub par service rude host this is new york city not seattle hire a wait staff who has a clue or just close up shop since youre this far west anyway will never return .
great margaritas best margaritas in the city their ceviches arent bad either shrimp crab and tuna they usually have on the pricey side for the margartias though if its not happy hour .
just happened to be walking the high line while they were cleaning their ovens on a sunday morning can u say yummy hack hack hack cough choke chortle .
good outdoor seating area pretty good burritos the draw is really the outside seating though for authentic cuisine id go elsewhere but if youre looking for a place to get an outside drink and have a decent burrito its pretty much your best option .
good pizza slow and unfriendly service the pizza was quite good rs the service not good at all slow and unfriendly they were not even busy and the waitress was mia .
south philly hot spot they have a decent selection of tex mex and as well as beer and tequila it tends to become extremely crowded so plan accordingly when ordering drinks s .
cute spot didnt love it service was good but confused waiters couldnt figure out who was waiting on us my pizza was not a stand out loml felt pasta was just ok .
just try something new and enjoy .
absolutely horrible do not waste your money on this crap its disgusting i went on a sunday and had to pay the dinner price at 3pm for the buffet and a soda it came out to 16 and it was a complete waste of money .
fantastic margarita good food also very great place for hang out with friends and family .
i went here on sunday and i was not impressed the food was so gross and the soup tasted like dish water also the staff was so rude and it took them forever to get my drinks i got sick from this place so stay away .
very good food .
very slow service was waiting for food for over an hour food just ok not worth the money waste of evening .
happy hour margs are half price off pitchers and free chips and salsa verde and roja that topped with great vegetarian options and specials and really nice staff great atmosphere .
second week ive attempted to dine at calle ocho made hostess aware of our previous encounter with the establishment she passively listened to only say theres the bar and two lounges if you can find something there your more than welcome to have a seat lovely just lovely .
came here for the pre drinks prior to dinner we had pitcher of margarita and did the tequila flights bartender was very friendly and explained to us about each of the shots on the tequila flights .
be advised this is a review in regards to the reservation process be explicit in how they take your name down since a single deviation in how they take it down leads to severe miscommunication in whether or not they will seat you .
great spot for a date or just to hang out the margarita pitchers are great i just personally think the sweet ones are too sweet food is good too and they bring chips and salsa with everything definitely a great spot in south philly .
terrible service and food .
great place the food is always good the guacamole is great margaritas are strong did i mention the margaritas hahaha a big favorite of mine when ever i can get down to passyunk .
went there for dinner last night after all the reviews i expected a good cubanspanish style restaurant only tuna ceviche was anything to write home about i guess they need to pump you with sangria to hide lack of flavor in food especially paella .
everyones so gosh darn good looking here 3 stars for that and the margaritas 1 star for the food .
came here for brunch had my 2 sangrias and the latin benedict about 3 hrs later had projectile vomiting and some ahem other gi issues never coming back here again .
love the food love the margs love the outdoor seating love the specials just with service could be a bit faster .
bleh not good food unsavory the sangrias were pretty awful too go elsewhere .
food is pretty good and the outdoor seating is nice .
beware had a so called cuban sandwich it is the worst sandwich i ever had bread not cuban but a soft supermarket bread roast pork was cold and very small potions no cheese ham or pickles will never return to this so called cuban cuisine restaurant .
i love it yum burritos i love the vegan options and the staff is always so fun sometimes they disappear but usually its fine the place is always busy .
cuban it wasnt bad but it wasnt great service was kind but no rules of steps of service were followed in the smallest since the table beside us as well as my table were not greeted and served water for 8 minutes and so it goes .
quality food at a good price its not a frills place with the atmosphere they have a nice outdoor eating section and the inside is very quaint with the mexican decor my wife and i have been here twice and both times have not been disappointed .
this place has a big buzz and to be honest it was better before i went for brunch last sunday the service was ok the sangria was kind of cheap the food was cold at times was disappointing next i will stick to the dinner menu .
good place for food and drinks with friends good salads and vegetarian friendly .
i honestly dont remember much about this place and its been just over a week since i ate here i cant recall what we ate i do remember the sangria and the service which were both great so since i cant remember it was obviously forgettable .
went there last night for our anniversary it was yummy food fun outdoor seating great neighborhood my bly complaint is the outdoor seating allows smokers woulgo again and split a pitcher of margaritas .
was so much better in the old location .
my favorite mexican goto consistency delicious food friendly atmosphere hipster service .
free bad sangria terrible bloody mary bland food oh and if you want someone from the staff to steal your phone go here .
awesome nachos complimentary chips and salsa including salsa verde lots of tequila choices and great jukebox service could have been quicker although the food didnt take very long to come out .
the old calle ocho was really good however the new one sucks big time the food was extremely bland and even the sangrias were not good and i tried 4 different ones i was extremely disappointed since i always enjoyed the original restaurant .
good margaritas best steak and nachos .
very good mohitos otherwise disappointing if you care about quality ingredients this is not the place for you every dish is also overspiced so beware i overpaid and was entirely unimpressed .
the quesadilla vegetariana is handsdown the best quesadilla ive ever had i usually dont care for mexican food but i loved this add the 10 pitcher special on happy hour margaritas and youve got yourself a winner .
ok the sangria was good other than that the total bridge and tunnel crowd was a mess at one point i thought i might be in queens or perhaps harlem good times pass .
love this place awesome margaritas and mojitos and great authentic mexican food reasonable prices also .
overrated .
margarita pitchers are great burritos are huge tacos are delicious friendly staff never once disappointed .
extremely disappointed was trying to come here for brunch on a sunday morning at 1030 got there and was turned away because they didnt open til 11 .
you had me at 5 margaritas .
trendy overpriced fake latin food at least its yumyum if you want to do it you better like alcohol and should try the brunch where the menu is more interesting than the dinner menu there is a great allyoucan eat sangria bar and the price is right .
liked this place a lot has an excellent slow cooked pork dish and a squash type soup that was very good definitely like the vibe and hustle and bustle good service on top of good food makes for a nice night out .
overrated terrible service smallish portions and did i say terrible service .
one of my favorite places in all of philadelphia for the margs and the chicken nachos above all the rest im just always happy when im here because im getting amazing food at a great price and im among good neighbors and friends .
free attracts a certain type of crowd calle ocho wont fail you there uws denizens abound people drinking free liquor will eat tartedup latin themed food thinking they are at cafe versailles bargain yes authentic to what free means you are paying for it elsewhere .
try the blood orange margaritas as well as the chicken tacos .
the food had way too much garlic the yucca bread was good drinks ok the service was subpar i gave it a shot but wouldnt return .
this place is the best everything is great the food service drinks people no other even comes close margaritas are amazing .
never again rudest staff ever try goodfellas better pizza nicer people and better food .
i love their margaritas food is good too sometimes the service is good but thats hitormiss .
im not impressed with their pizza so many better places to go good outdoor seating available to enjoy the mediocre pizza .
awesome margaritas and fish tacos the rest of the mexican i have had better ambiance is great fun place .
grabbed a slice here left a lot to be desired it was the last slice of the pie though so perhaps it would be better fresh .
great margharitas and burritos we loved it we go there to lunch very often again love the margharitas they are the best .
came here with friends how disappointed i was to learn this is the same place as vezzo in murray hill just under a different name same corner location with outdoor seating same menu same wretched crackerthin crust i didnt like it uptown still not a fan here .
eat here goat burrito or mushroom quesodilla drink here tecante strawberryguava mojito or frozen watermelon margarita buy your bartender a drink here jameson sit outside and smoke here they sell smokes too bring your dog here outside of course and mostly drink here toto bien .
i came here with benj and i genuinely think this place is kind of overhyped i think the brisket at mighty quinns tastes so much better imho this place is tiny and everything was pretty dry i was pretty sad cus i love barbecue .
cantina is the best best margaritas best atmosphere great place .
the brisket was good but all the sides sucked the service kind of sucked too .
the cantina offers large portions for reasonable prices ive never left without leftovers for a couple of days they also have some of the best margaritas around i recommend the smoked tofu fajitas yummmm .
14 for 2 ribs in my take out container tonight never again and they were dry .
good spot for good food not traditional mexican but good drinks and great staff .
nothing special overpriced and low quality bbq with no on tap beer when other good places like fette sau are in few mins walking distance with much better bbq beer and whiskey selection there is no point of going to this place .
take it from this loyal barfly cantina is it sweetest staff and the best beards burritos and booze in town .
insanely bad delivery service dont bother ordering food from here it wont arrive .
cheap good mexican food and margaritas definitely try the blood orange margaritas sea bass tacos and tilapia empanadas .
i dont know what changed behind the scenes but this place has really gone downhill the food is now extremely oily and they take over two hours to deliver unacceptable .
fried plantains and fish tacos love it good margaritas too crowded on occasion have always enjoyed my hours logged here drinking and eating .
ive downgraded my rating because the owner sent me a message and i sent a reply but he never responded what good is offering a makeup meal if youre not going to reply and honor it not nice .
the vegan beef burrito is yummy and the servers are always friendly and attentive the vegan fajitas are subpar though they have a weird fake smokey taste love the chips and salsa .
byob brisket spot but the brisket is more expensive 25lb and not as good as fette saus the line is still long though .
great food with lots of vegan choices tortilla chips not at all salty and the ice tea which can b a big blunder at bars was delicious and ice cold .
if i could give them zero stars i would no stars surly service .
very good mexican place it has a cool look inside and the food was good i would return .
had take out new years eve 2014 the worst food i have ever had stay clear of this place .
a fun place for drinking they also have delicious food vegan smoked tofu seitan fajitas are awesome you must try the endless summer margarita its got a cucumber and jalepeno flavor the perfect suprising combination of spicy cool tart and sweet .
the service was so bad today it took a hour to receive our food it was just crazy then the crazy part that our water is warm not cold at all .
one of the most consistent restaurants in philadelphia food drink and service are good does not claim to be authentic mexican food i visit cantina way too frequently .
good for the price of the food but i def had better sushi .
great atmospheregreatdrinks .
ambience is good and portions are way more generous than you would think food is pricey but not as delicious we ordered the restaurants recommendation but it was not great we tried it because of the other great reviews in yelp but are disappointed .
great experience great staff i had amazing cheese quesadillas w a smoky sour cream the homemade salsas are bangin and it was very affordable go team .
food was excellent however service ruined our special time one lame waitress for 6 tables is not good no matter how good the food although it was a sunday night there should be at least 2 waitresses not in a rush to come back .
basically hot waitstaff yummy margaritas bangin chips and salsa the red salsa is better than the green one imho fun ambiance hot waitstaff thats all you need to know go .
oh hell no this place is really bad cheesy decor aside the food is overpriced and really tasteless yuck i think my chicken was genetically modified it was huge and had been frozen for 100 years because it was tasteless aside from the weird tasting bits .
ok so ive had awesome service over the last few months and the music seems a hair quieter food and drink still great love that the kitchen stays open so late hooray .
so maybe we ordered wrong we got a caesar salad and a pizza pretty deficient service was friendly but not super attentive i probably wouldnt go back .
notsogood people smoking outside gets annoying can get pricey good the bbq seitan tacos are awesome the seitantofu fajita platter is terrific as well servers are friendly and very knowledgeable about vegetarianvegan options freeunlimited chips and salsa .
the service was great the food was extremely salty but their selection of unfiltered sake was amazing i might come back but i have definitely had better .
while it seems the servers moonlight as suicide girls the food is heavenly starting with the plantain appretizers on to the mahi mahi tacos and with 24 mojito pitchers youll agree youve found your newest favorite south philly joint .
just so so in terms of a lot of high quality japanese restaurant in nyc not worth of waiting .
a waitress here told me the blended margaritas have the highest alcohol content shes right if you get the waiter with hard nipples hes a he just leave you will get nowhere due to his slothlike tendencies .
i come here at least twice a week for a couple of months now but the portion of cod fish i got today was minuscule literally half the size of what i usually get also the chawanmushi is tasteless so try to avoid it .
why im a fan 1 good tequila and beer selection 2 good mexican food 3 great juke box 4 cool servers the wings are tasty but on the sweet side burritos are large and in charge the fajitas are big enough to share .
the hostess tells everyone 1015 min without accessing the tables as the line gets longer and longer still 1015 minutes after 25 min i just walked away .
best south philly restaurantbar pros salsa verde happy hour pitchers steak nachos and carne asada yum yum and more yum cons it can be really busy and hard to get a table weekdays are the best option .
came here for lunch and was seated by the bar by a very curt waitress there was a good selection of interesting toppings but the soba was too salty and they overcooked my friends bowl that came with the lunch set .
amazing vegan fajitas best ive ever had worth it for that dish alone .
i was looking forward to eating here but i was very disappointed the broth was too salty here and i was mad thirsty after my meal i dont think the soba was worth the price .
we go here quite often good place to drink or grab dinner the vegetarian quesadilla and blood orange margs are delicious service is soso there are some great servers but when the wait is long it gets a little spotty love the outdoor seating and tequila selection .
tempura was very oily to the point where my stomach felt gross after a few bites this is probably because the kitchen is in a hurry to fry the food and the oil wasnt hot enough go a few blocks down the street to soba ko instead .
one night this drunk creepy dude was bothering my friends and i and the bartender happened to notice and totally distracted him from us so we could still have a good night .
this place isnt all that .
excellent brunch and like most places the earlier the better .
the broth is too salty .
fantastic great young vibe one of the first on the block to start the revitalization of south philadelphia great food margaritas and beer on tap i think people who vote this place low should stay in rittenhouse square or manayunk or margate .
disappointed at the latest visit they took away some of the best menu items and the service has gone down ill stick with cocoron at least it has character and tofu .
yum great selection for everyone including vegetarians and vegans great drink specials and service seating is a bit cramped but with such delicious and inexpensive fooddrinks im not the least bit surprised their sister restaurant cantina dos segundos is great too .
bland food beautifully prepared i am not the best judge of bland food as i like some flavor and heat in my food we tried the lunch box set as well as the daily special eel and just dont get it give me some flavor .
great happy hour good food good beer selection pretty good prices very friendly staff too my only complaint is that it is always ridiculously packed and the people that go there are way too hipster for my liking .
surprisingly expensive for decent food in a no frills environment .
bartenders always ready with your next beer or marg and the goat tacos are insanely good great beer selection and breakfast is ok as well .
it was alright the place was clean service was good but the food wasnt anything special prices seemed a bit high for what youre getting so i dont think ill be going back anytime soon .
great tequila and the one waiterbartender has a lot of knowledge about tequila the food is great lots of veggie options only bad thing is that it is often too loud to hear your dinner companions .
expect a long wait because the noodles here are really good thats undeniable no points deducted for the wait points awarded for yummy noodles i was very disappointed with our awful server overpricedunderportioned and the soso ambiance .
good place to grab a toasted portuguese roll and a coffee and sit amongst the elders of the ironbound nice ladies behind the counter .
mediocre food i had a salmon very dry and overlooked not good at all my colleagues had veggie burger and said it was very greesy .
good sandwiches portuguese style and peaceful atmosphere .
went to a bahama breeze in viriginia and had a great experience the location in wayne nj however has horrible service seated outside waited 15 minutes and left no one acknowledged our existence .
great breakfast kitchen sink skillet was out of sight amazing bf had crime brûlée french toast it was a foodgasm .
its what you might expect from a crappy chain restaurant blah food okay drinks its like the tgif of the caribbean .
food was amazing only knock would be thats its cash only but bedsides that the staff was friendly and service was fast i would definitely come here again i tried the shrimp and grits it was perfect .
horrible food slooooow service bland no flavor tastes like microwave food save your money .
my favorite place to go in philly for breakfast or lunch their chicken salad is amazing and their creme brûlée french toast is to die for their iced coffee is also delicious ive never been disappointed .
came here for dinner with family everything was generally flavorless or flavorbad i had the jumbalaya which was wayyy oversalted dont come here for seafood or caribbean food maybe if you really like chain restaurants .
ahhhhhmazing we bought the kitchen sink steak and eggs and their special apple pie french toast so delicious every single bite .
it sucks the bathroom is filthy slow service .
greatest breakfastbrunch place in philly its almost always busy but for good reason the food is great the portions large and wait staff are super cool take a woman there shell love it i promise you .
ok atmosphere fun sat outisde as it was nice day had a few drinks appetizers ok for what it is .
its always one of my go to place for brunch great service great food highly recommend the kitchen sinkits huge greasy and delicious perfect to cure a bad hangover cons cash only and they have an atm inside that will charge a fee boo .
over a half hour for appetizers never received our entres was told they lost our order in the kitchen was just told that we will not be getting food at all and the manager will void our order starving highly unprofessional will never visit again .
well executed breakfast with lots of options big portions little prices maybe 15 minute wait fast service the shrimp and grits was outstanding the broccoli rob and sausage frittata same scrap it was okay i still like habbersets the best .
worst service maybe of all time wasted two hours for food honestly terrible dont go food bad dont go dont go dont go left feeling sick and annoyed and nearly missed event 0 stars .
love it .
this place obviously only exists because of nj devil fans and ppl who are trapped at the prudential center this place has really strange hours and is mostly closed when i walk by it this place is only worth going to for a draft beer .
fresh creative and delicious this place always wows me and i love going here for something different from the regular breakfast food routine they even have amazing hot drinks their peanut butter and jelly latte being my absolute favorite .
great space and courteous staff the food is overpriced the food looks appetizing but the taste doses not match didnt visit the bar would give it another chance if i had no other option .
your food was incredible and i want to come back despite the photos of the rats leaking on the table did someone set you up your still one of my fav breakfast spot in the city .
quality of pizzas has taken a serious turn for the worse since it first opened less creative offerings and ingredient quality has diminished .
if you have a huge appetite you should definitely get the red velvet pancakes if not share with another person like i once did my favorite has to be the apple pie french toast great place to have brunch with a friend or a date .
you would think this place would know how to handle a devils pregame crowd by now staff is extremely unprofessional and they need to stop throwing profanities around in front of customers .
so this is the best brunch ive ever had even the eggs was super bomb the wait was looooong but i see why a must if in philly .
do not go here they treat wellbehaved sports fans from prudential center like dirt they threaten patrons and their foodbeverage is crap there are better places nearby that will serve you better .
okay where can i start this place 34 years ago was just okay but today i just wanted to give it a try an other chance and wow they just left me with no words ill definitely will come back for more well done green eggs .
dont even chance it the pub was uncomfortably warm the bartenders were slow and listless and the 9 draft beers were flat seriously the guinness and smithwicks were utterly tasteless bad all around go anywhere but here .
unique menu and well prepared we shared the chicken waffles benedict and creme brûlée french toast we could barely stop shoveling them in to talk to each other .
i continue to hate this place worst service of all time newark airport please do something with this .
luv green eggs .
pretty terrible .
i love this place the food is absolutely delicious not to mention the atmosphere oh my goodness this place is awesome .
if you have a long layover and wanna watch tv or free internet or have a drink or eat some food in the terminal then this is a good place for u again as with all restaurants in airports it is pricey compared to those outside .
all of their food is good red velvet pancakes apple french toast fresh beef bacon eggs were ok overall i love the food i just wish it wasnt always a wait .
stopped in for a beer and a sandwich place is ok for the airport seen .
listen i cant tell you what to do right but i can make a suggestion and i suggest you go if crowds arent your thinggo during the week treat yourself to fancy french toast and byob mimosas go ahead you deserve it .
high prices small menu slow service indifferent staff cant wait to leave slow with the tab do yourself a favor and avoid bad even for the newark airport .
loved their cream of mushroom soup as well as the creme brûlée french toast everything was prepared well and tasted great fast and friendly service think its safe to say ill be making this my regular brunch spot .
its a crime to have guinness in the title of this hell hole surly staff sticky counters and overpriced drinks hooray .
pretty long wait but not too bad got their famous red velvet pancakes and chicken and waffles we couldnt finish the pancakes but they were good i would recommend going when you are extremely hungry and have a sweet tooth .
ordered take out the place was crowded but the food was so so looking we decided to give it a try we ordered nachos naked burrito and chicken burrito it was all gross dont waste your money here it was less than fast food quality .
starting to be one of my favorite brunch spots the french toast is excellent my favorite breakfast food and their breakfast specials are to die for love the sugar cubes but it its not your deal then make sure you bring your splenda equal or sweetnlow with you .
i got here at 1050 and was told they were closed it closes at 11pm and was told sorry you should have gotten here earlier .
excellent food portions are huge kitchen sink is delicious i ordered the gravy on the side the figgy pudding oatmeal was like dessert .
not good anymore .
my first time visiting i thought it was just another over rated breakfast spot in philadelphia but the food was actually great friendly and fast service as well as a peaceful environment the food presentation is also beautiful i enjoyed myself .
mediocre at best ordered the arugula apple goat cheese salad and pappardelle togo the pasta tasted very bland and had a cardboard like texture to it .
the grilled cheese with tomato soup is of god .
the food is no good gave me food poisoning for 2 days i was throwing up 2 hours after i ate there beef kebab do yourself a favor and go to the spanish restaurant next door .
this food was delicious i got the eggs your way with the rosemary potatoes the wait was only 20 mins but the food definitely made up for the time i will always recommend someone to eat at green eggs cafe excellent .
the absolute worst service ever ordered online only one roll got to the place and the food wasnt ready for 30 min so overall waited for one roll be made for 1 hr .
i love this place driving by and decided to stop by im so glad we did french toast is amazing home made whip cream mmm mmm mmm potatoes with peppersonions are delish shrimp and grits it a must we will be back .
good but not the best i did a side by side of my 3 favorites coopers hobbys bragmans coopers is my 2nd favorite but bragmans rules at 1 .
the kitchen sink was incredible wait was long which was unfortunate but well worth it cash only .
local bistro fare is good but what the two french fellas and the food lack is any joie de vivre perfunctory service and no humour or smiles so may other places where they at least seem glad you are there .
all i can say is delicious the stone ground grits were amazing they are southern style much like i had in nawlens with shrimp the food was fresh and flavorful and you get sooo much for what you pay i cant wait to go back and try more .
went here for the second time and it wasnt as good as i remembered ordered the pasta steak frites mussel appetizer and two drinks overall just underwhelming total bill including tip came out to lil over 100 maybe people go because its the only bistro in the area .
well staffed even during the lunch rush hour food is awesome met a regular and he said everything on the menu is great and judging by the meal i just had crème brulé french toast id probably agree with him this place is packed for good reason .
it was my birthday and they did absolutely nothing to make me feel happyspecial they were fine aside from running about 20 minutes late theyre french in attitude and service the food is good this place is certainly overrated .
the atmosphere and service was great the food was amazing we had the creme brûlée french toast and the pork belly eggs benedict all delicious .
below average food and ambiance .
great coffee servings are very large and not low in calories but very tasty service very good .
kitchen was closed at 1015 so o early .
the grits and shrimp are out of this world .
scam alert be careful and check your credit card statement if you go here these guys charged me a 90 tip on a 15 bill thankfully i noticed it on my statement and amex will take care of it .
i have gone to the one off 13th and dickinson streets great food especially the steak and eggs the staff is great and always friendly .
food onion soup bland lacks rich caramelized onion flavor beet salad decent but nothing to rave about steak sandwich frites best thing out of the whole meal service okay probably wont go back .
i love this place the breakfast here is ludicrously excellent the service is good if you are heading to here bring cash does not accept credit cards .
bad service average food two visits confirmed this .
one word amazing im never eating breakfast nowhere else .
if i could give him negative stars i would i honestly think the only reason this place is still in business is because it is a great location the owner is an asshole plain and simple food is terrible and the drinks are weak .
i absolutely looove this place i had the eggs benedict and wow it was a party in my mouth my boyfriend had the creme brulee french toast and that was like a rave in my mouth go here you wont be sorry tasty tasty food .
food is ok love the tomato soup but worst service ever rude arrogant unprofessional and extremely claustrophobic oh and get your cash if you go there 2014 and they dont accept credit .
one of the best breakfast spots in philly period creative and tasty items to satisfy anyone this place is jammed every weekend for a reason .
went for dinner and their food leaned too heavily on sugar soy sauce garlic and butter for flavor definitely not worth the 20 price .
9 out of 10 definitely recommend steak and eggs were incredible a must .
tight space i feel intruding into other people space while brunching i got egg benedict the egg was pouched well but the hollandaise sauce was poorly done very watery and no taste to it it could be better .
there is always a wait for brunch and i happily sit in it brunch is great byo and the service is fast we are normally a larger group and our food comes out timely hot and delicious .
really nook after 3 great times you let me down when i came with 4 friends 45 min wait and the host kept saying 5 more minutes we left after 50 min to hit thai noodle .
yeah im feeling this spot im skeptical of a place that franchises but i ripped the hell out of that kitchen sink platter they offer best part no carbs in the entire plate no wait im kidding but its fantastic so go .
very disappointed i went this restaurant because the positive reviews on yelp the service was very bad even no orange juice at this restaurant i ordered salmon sandwich and soup they were just ok .
words cant describe how good this place is from the coffee to the staff to the insanely good menu and specials this is a once a week stop in for me .
this place literally seats 10 people at most the staff has no sense of customer service and no the food wont make up for it do yourself a favor walk two blocks down to riposo .
bit of a wait on weekends but delicious food great quinoa breakfast french toast is thick and yummy omelets are also tasty as is the potato side friendly service and modern decor .
i walked in excited to try to the goulash and was told he was fully booked with two empty tables horrible way to treat a customer just because he didnt want to seat one person .
this place has become a favorite if you want a fun and unique breakfast place look no further delicious i only give it 4 instead of 5 because the service has been slow routinely over my many visits slow not bad ill still be going back .
what happened service today was horrible im a pretty quick eater but was rushed beyond belief what happened to the old nook .
great place food is amazing and the coffee is free flowing marcella and angelica gave excellent service with equally amazing smiles this is a prime spot .
the service was extremely poorthe waitress was aggressive and rude .
awesome breakfast the red velvet pancakes are killer great staff too .
the food was excellent but the worst dining experience food was cold and sitting next to a vent that was ice cold on a cold day was not very comfortable the staff was friendly and said they would have changed it if we would have said something earlier .
i love the food here the atmosphere is nice depending on when you go and servers are friendly i highly recommend this location over the one in the northern liberties area food and service there is horrible .
their salchipapa was whack sorry but it was super greasy price was great but the food wasnt impressive and the place was too small it just wasnt what i thought for a four star in yelp .
a neighborhood gem come early to avoid a long wait on weekends it can be very busy and the floors are neglected with food all over the place come hungry .
sat there for 45 minutes they kept telling us it was almost ready and then said it would be an hour more we just left .
loved it service was ok ive been there twice both time i was very impressed with my meal definitely try the quinoa porridge and grilled cheese with the tomato soup yum grilled cheese is my fav .
very disappointed i order half of chicken and it had this terrible smell when i let them know they got offended telling me the chicken was from that morning which i dont believe it anticuchos were ok huancaina was mediocre definitely not coming back .
i love to take friends and family visiting from out of town here for sunday brunch the only thing that can be annoying is the wait but it is well worth it .
the worst falafal sandwich ever it is cold and half empty falafal hard to find i asked for hot and white sauce and it is hard to find pita is cold and broken .
awesome breakfast spot suggest by the aloft hotel staff the red velvet pancakes was great and enough for 3 people the kitchen sinks sausage gravy was the best i have ever tasted great service too .
i just dont understand why this place is so popular on yelp their food is simply aweful except the falafel i got sick every time i tried their food .
delicious fresh and innovative whats not to like did i mention delicious good luck gettin a table .
got the beef and lamb shawarma blah meat was dry and lacked flavor the rice was blah the salad had beets that looked like they were artificially colored maybe i should have got the chicken because clearly is their focus .
usually a great alternative to sabrinas and morning glory the food id great and usually the lines arent as long as the other places though that is changing i always go for the specials .
the chicken and rice is actually pretty decent the two star rating is because they have some shady practices theyll charge you 7 for it if they can tell its your first time when they charge others 6 read the recent reviews .
just about tried every french toast special they all rule if you are really hungry try the red velvet pancakes or share they are megahuge today i tried the lunch for the first time a cheese steak wfries it was excellent the eggs benedict are great as well .
anything that looks like this shouldnt be eaten wake up folks .
i love love this place the establishment is really small and cozy and has a home feel to it the food is organic and so tasty i go here for brunch anytime i want something really good try the steak and eggs special its really good .
not the best in the city whats going on with these reviews id say the place is slightly below average didnt like seeing the guy handle money and food with same bare hands over and over .
1306 dickinson st in south philly reasonable prices huge portions definitely splitable they always have interesting specials during the day street parking is easy nearby its one of our favorite places for breakfast brunch or lunch service is fine and the food keeps us going back .
the falafel is great every bite is perfectly crispy but the rest of the sandwhich wrap lettuce etc is totally plain hot sauce is a good touch though .
best breakfast spot in philly must haves crem brulee french toast the kitchen sink great food of the week cant go wrong herbs grown on the roof get your name on the wait list early best in class brunch overall .
i had a falafel sandwich from here that tasted like feces literally not sure how that happens how can you go wrong with fried chickpeasspices i also dont like the mess they leave behind on the sidewalk everyday yuck .
one of the best breakfast places i have ever been but overpriced and atm charges 9 dollars so bring cash .
if this place were not on the airport i never would have went now that i have i wish i hadnt was there for lunch service slow unattentive food was below mediocre .
food is good waitress jen is better she is friendly and always makes me feel at home ask for her .
not a fan onion soup had way too much bread and cheese barely any broth and onions omelette had absolutely no seasoning and homefries were very bland my local diner does a much better meal not bad simply average next .
great food today thanks al .
i was excited to visit this spot as its conveniently close to home service was awful food was nothing out of the ordinary ill stick to ruths chrisstk to satisfy my palette .
best brunch ever .
the service is always lousy and if you complain to the manager he really could care less so i wont be going back even though its very close to where i live .
the kitchen sink is everything you could want in one skillet home fries peppers and onions eggs cheese two biscuits and gravy on top what more do you need .
very disappointed two pizzas and a salad56 bucks including their old smokey shoulda been called old salty truly inedible and we eat anything at least the beer takeout store across the street is excellent .
the kitchen sink that is all .
nothing special save your money we ordered the plain red whole pie and were very disappointed tastes like a 5 rusty pie dough was tough to chew sauce and cheese were flavorless very saltysour .
this is my breakfast joint a block from my house and great food i have yet to have a bad meal here yet but i recommend the pork belly benedict and the kitchen sink if you are going there for the first time .
just simply bad pizza they use an american cheese or something similar on their pizza its dry and has no flavor .
great service i mean really great great food will definitely become a regular .
i had a dave panini and risotto balls and i was astonished at how bland they both were yet i still paid 18 with a drink .
great place service and food are wonderful only downfall is that its always crowded but they try to seat you fast its a frequent for me .
hair in our delivery order that took an hour to arrive mediocre food owner refused to refund any more than the one sandwich as though the rest of this isnt tainted as well avoid .
dont know what other people are complaining about sure the wait is long on the weekend and the service can be a bit short but the menu is fresh and original and not as overpriced as sabrinas cafe try the quinoa unbelievable .
ordered a breakfast bagel sandwich and a long roll breakfast sandwich got two long roll sandwiches and one had eggshells in it .
excellent food not too pricey service didnt wow me clean and pleasant atmosphere .
the food was decent some of the things i liked some were terrible my broccoli wasnt good and friends meal was cold its typical chain food restaurant service was poor too .
yayy for green eggs get the tofu scramble and add goat cheese thats all you need to know also the grits are bangin .
ive been to many fridays but this one is definitely my least favorite the quality of the food wasnt the greatest the service was not up to par and the wait was too long compared to the other fridays ive been to .
this place deserves better reviews starting with mine 5 stars you earned it .
charge 18 gratuity on items even if theyre discounted 48 service charge paid on a 120 meal .
yummy large portions outdoor seating i will be back .
the first greetings is you guys doesnt have a patience even im not raise my hand to asking for a server stay away from this restaurant specially for asian cause they treat asian all is same no patience lol .
4 words crème brulée french toast try it delicious i will be back for more of that and everything else on the menu looks delicious this place is great for brunch .
the menu advertises farm fresh eggs but they will only cook them scrambled hmm perhaps they are fresh from the powdered egg farm homefries seemed to be a boiled potato that had been diced service was quick and price was right .
most delicious tender juicy chicken around ratatouille was amazing small space big flavor dont miss this place .
looks like a diner everything but waitress at counter is in a rush to nowhere food cannot be made to order and as mentioned in other reviews .
so good so easy so affordable just got into my hotel from the train and chicken provence was exactly what i needed to revive had the chicken provençal bowl with rice ratatouille and rotisserie chicken i couldnt finish it the portion was so generous .
ordered egg sandwich with fried potatoes the fried potatoes were stale our server was not so well mannered would recommend to try some other restaurant than this one at ewr .
i ordered the chicken provençal the chicken is great but the ratatouille it comes with is fantastic the folks behind the counter are awful nice too oh and its very reasonably priced .
good food bad service .
i literally never write reviews on places but this was absurdly good i had the rotisserie chicken bowl over roasted potatoes with gravy try it immediately .
the server was pretty nice but the food was pretty awful the home fries were soggy and bland the melon they offered me to make up for it was tasteless at least the sausage was tasty .
no time now love this place for rotisserie chicken on french baguette just right perfect little place .
not a real diner the 3 page menu lists about 6 breakfast items the hash browns were undercooked and tasteless the eggs and sausage were fine go instead to the garden state diner which has a more complete menu .
update got the quarter of a chicken with rotisserie style potatoes so good remind me of my moms potatoes yum and so affordable .
floor was greasy burger was just okay service dont expect any .
had their signature chicken sandwich last week and their soup today pro knows chicken looking forward to trying everything on the menu .
take airport food and put it in a diner pricey bad food tuna melt was basically a bread sandwich tuna was very thin .
absolutely delicious cant get enough of the quinoa salad with chicken perfection .
this is a good place to stay if youre waiting for your flight go for chicken sandwiches avoid the burgers unless you want to pound lots of beer the expediter is hilarious .
best kept secret in ny the most delicious food ive had in ny made and served by the most sincere and humble french couple in the city authentic simple delicious .
how can a diner in nj mess up something like an egg sandwich and home fries in the diner state well just come to rubys and youll find out limp english muffin chewy brittle bacon and horrific home fries await .
amazing food have to try the cauliflower and the carrot cake .
if you must then you must it did feel like you were removed from the airport so thats a plus .
good place and tasty food .
ok food as most airports high prices 10 for a hamburger .
great meal chicken gazpacho and the creamy cauliflower were fresh and fantastic owners are lovely and helpful the common table was fun a great find we will definitely return .
back area smells so bad i had to get up and leave smelled like my cats box on back front smelled okay .
this was great find in murray hill small but puts out a great product i always find an unexpected gem while in ny and this may well be it any its priced right too .
typical overpriced eastside restaurant pasta was cloying service indifferent only saving grace was helpful busboys .
this is roast chicken at its finest well seasoned moist chicken roasted potatoes and sautéed spinach perfection best deliverytake out in midtown by far owners are passionate about their product and its evident in their products superb taste quality and selection .
to order a cappuccino u wait more and less 5 minutes and the waiters are totally unprofessional and rude they want the tip also if u take a cappuccino to go but forget about it these waiters need to learn how to be professional for getting the tips .
wonderful place for lunch chopped green chicken salad is perfectly light but filling service is both fast and friendly .
had their tiramisu not a fan .
chicken provence is a great addition to the area staff is super friendly and the food is fresh and amazing the homemade salads are a must have .
absurd and disrespectful i was there for coffee and tiramisu about 130pm im not served because according to gentleman who works at this cafe i have to have lunch otherwise they are not be able to serve dessert and coffee ridiculous .
the carrot cake looks unappetizing but amazingly good moist and fluffy with a perfect balance of sweetness for me ratatouille is tasty and chicken is tender and moist .
horrible service the barista was unable to manage the orders of a line of 5 customers two lines were formed and people besides myself were visibly agitated orders were taken of people who just walked in versus those in line .
such a wonderful new spot in midtown the staff are very friendly and the food is amazing i had the chicken baguette with a small side of ratatouille both were delicious .
a 16 oz takeout iced coffee for 4 bucks shouldve asked first so shame on me but never again .
fantastic chicken cesar salad for dinner for 11 love it great service too very nice people .
cramped slow service over priced food on the ues my melon proscuitto salad totaled 18 iced cafe latte tastes more like milk than espresso what more is there to review about done never coming back .
omg thank god that i found this place yes the owner is very nice and kind the chicken i ordered with two sides were awesome please try you will like it so much .
this is not a coffee shop its for stuffy stuck up upper east side old ladies who want to drink over priced weak coffee thats ooo la la its italian so basically if youre looking for any kind of latte type drink turn around .
order takeout half chicken 2 sides so good and so fast chicken is very juicy vegis are fresh and well prepared side salad had a nice light dressing owneremployees are very nice .
ok food was not impressed had a panini and tuna salad for lunch the tuna was out of a can mixed in with lettuce and one piece of tomato on the side nothing special and way overpriced for what it is .
walked in when they were closing and the owners gave me and my friend their last chicken and sides of the day they were extremely friendly and the food was delicious .
ive never been asked to move so that another customer could have my seat that is until i came to via quadronno today even good coffee cant make up for service like that and i like good coffee .
attractive authentic frenchrun spot for fragrant rotisserie chicken and comfort food sides one farm table available to stay delicieux .
this is an overpriced cafe with rude cold service uncomfortable seating and no soy milk plus i think the neighborhood rubs me the wrong way as well i will say however that my latte was pretty good and my coconut gelato was delicious .
truly lovely people atmosphere and thankfully comforting delicious food best of luck looking forward to stopping in for a home cooked meal again soon .
the new bald bartender completely ruined my experience at this place if you like to drink dont come here canoe club has better service .
the best chicken ever had the roasted potatoes with a whole chicken quinoa salad tastes like heaven just a great place to eat .
god i dislike murphys the books cut in half to fit into the walls the pretentious motto polished casual the horrible food just go to mollys .
had the 14 kitchen and creamy cauliflower and it was really great delicious and fresh great addition to the neighborhood .
i had dinner here last week and the food is something any novice cook could definitely create in their kitchen serving size is small definitely have to order appetizer if you want to be satisfied for dinner price is expensive for the serving size and the neighborhood .
what a nice surprise when we decided to have some grinders here for dinner last night the food was very good the service was great and the prices where very reasonable we work nearby and weve found a new go to for italian .
food is mediocre pricey .
very good food but quite small portion the environment is very beautifully decorated with a lot of red roses so the restaurant is very romantic sangaria is good too the main dishes are relatively small portions .
the food might be good but i wouldnt know because they turned me away at 840 when it says that theyre open until 9pm thanks for nothing from the parking lot of your poorly decorated establishment .
what a great restaurant it is a hidden gem on 9th avenue the flowers and decor make it very romantic the food and service is great .
i dont know what happened to this place i ordered a buffalo here and i got really sick from it i cant come back here again .
if youre wanting great tapas with a unique atmosphere this place is a must .
the original steak and hoagie was once a really amazing place after a series of ownership changes and a location change it is just ok its still worth dropping in for a quick lunch but its not nearly as good as it used to be .
this place is absolutely amazing the decor the food and the ambience are all on point .
beautiful place but the bartenders are rude completely rude among the worst ive seen if they dont like the customers find another place to work .
you have to love this place perfect for couples extremely romantic it has to be one of the most romantic restaurant in the city delicious food great for a date night or dinner with friends .
this place used to be great not anymore they used to make the best cheese steaks but now they dont put any meet on them its actually kind of joke how little steak they put in a cheese steak it looks more like a grilled cheese .
delicious food the ambience was perfect it wasnt too loud or too quiet and the decor was extremely well thought out id go back in a heartbeat great for a date night or dinner with friends it was easy to linger over many dishes and bottles of wine .
ive ordered from them twice and twice the pizza was like soup on a piece of wonder bread the people there are also big grouchy pants .
great tapas restaurant wonderful ambience the food was very authentic creative and delicious we did dinner here and were very happy we did the paella is delicious worth the wait flowers all through out the restaurant very good spot for a romantic dinner .
im very sad to say i dont think ill be coming back to el cafeito after my experience with the new management .
best spanish restaurant in the city hands down i grew up in spain and have been here at least 20 times for the extreme high quality delicious food keep up the great work .
if you like waiting for brisket that is 95 sinew 5 meat this place is for you by waiting i mean over a hour in a completely empty restaurant the sides were mediocre at best too bad mighty quinn in clifton much better .
very nice setting amid chelsea vibrant scene with low lighting and jazz in the background savory and beautiful dishes such as the razor clams to the oatatas bravas serve by a very attentive staff one of my favorite spanish restaurants in nyc .
ordered family meal 1 for pickup when we got home opened up containers all the food was charred black dry burnt chicken ribs coleslaw tasted like it was from a supermarket tub and mac and cheese had no flavor grossest bbq ever .
delicious .
this place is outsources their deliveries and doesnt deliver without a 75 min ridic .
great wine tapas joseph is great knowledgeable and awesome oscar del mercado the bartender is not so great pretentious and rude and insulted my friends spanish .
manager was rude delivery for a party came an hour late and side dishes were missing .
beautiful space potato and chick pea dishes are outstanding eggplant crudo and artichoke dishes are exquisite great sangria ambience and food make for an unparalleled tapas experience .
food was not that great place needs a good steam cleaning also tried to overcharge me and when i brought it up they made the correction without an apology doubt ill go again .
great food and killerkiller drinks but the ambience is what really makes this place special .
the owners comment is true to some extent i tended to only write reviews about places i do not like i have added some comments on bbq joints i did like this is just another in a series of reviews by walter a blorch thespian and food consumer .
intimate place full but quiet enough where you can actually have a conversation food ranged from the exquisite raw mackerel to the juicy branzino .
i see two other people who feel the same as i do i have had better maybe we all caught them on a bad night not much more i can say try for yourself .
this is my favorite restaurant in this city decor is amazing sexy enchanting super romantic dozens of roses dim lighting beautiful lighting accents creatively placed around the restaurant food is great service is personal love love love .
stay clear they have a threatening bartender he seems to have a screw loose and he is big and dangerous not a safe place stay clear .
second time here as good as my first time great food in an amazing beautiful restaurant cant wait for next time .
the one good thing i can say about this place is the atmosphere but my husband i both had fruit flies on our plates we both had burgers that werent anything special we most likely will never go back .
great had artichoke app and the rice and crab dish my wife had the special branzino all was terrific .
the buffet was sub par and the room was dingy the party was a success because of the people who arranged it as i said before i have had much better not the spanish tavern .
excellent i love tapas and this place was phenomenal it was not one element that made it great it was the sum of its parts i am shocked to find such an absolutely perfect restaurant .
the food turned out okay until we ordered pineapple juice for our daughter her kids cup had a fly in it so upset .
the decor is beyond gorgeous there are beautiful flowers everywhere heaven just thought the food was overpriced the portions were a tad small .
well theyve updated the brunch menu but i wouldnt necessarily say theyve improved it .
amazing food wide variety of unique dishes we had the seafood paella and it was outstanding the staff was wonderful and made great recommendations beautiful atmosphere although we didnt get to see the outdoor seating as there was a private event taking place .
le ptit house of framed stock photos of the eiffel tower emporium where the food is bland and over priced .
service staff are professional and warm ambiance is exceptional especially in the enchanted garden food is really good and portions are generous .
decent french fare nice staff clean dining room slightly over priced limited menu nice wine choices .
ended up randomly having dinner here and couldnt have been happier with it the atmosphere is amazing as is the food .
went for brunch coffee was terrible eggs benedict was mediocre not worth the ten dollars .
first of all the atmosphere there is really really nice perfect place for a date or hang out with a couple of good friends but the food is even better we shared the paella and some tapas everything tasted great and staff was also friendly .
the roastedchicken i had wasnt warm and the portions are small i can get a great meal at a bodega that cooks puerto rican food and other hispanic dishes .
this place is amazing coming from las vegas ive eaten at many great restaurants this place may be 1 of my favs decor beautiful service was great sangria done right and the paella was hands down best i ever had make a reso and enjoy some great dishes .
they were shut down by the department of health for obvious reasons i actually miss the coffee the oatmeal was very good as well i dont see myself going back theyve lost a customer .

the sangria the beautiful fragrance of fresh flowers and the tapas make this place a totally unique magical wonderful experience plus my family has been able to get in within an hour of calling both times that we went .
not good beans tasted like they heated them up right out the can no seasoning the mofongo was boiled plantains mashed up and 2 little piece of crackling never again next time ill stick to places in el barrio .
the ambiance was magic the outdoor space in particular is really special the food excellent flavorful well prepared thoughtfully plated the tuna ceviche and patatas bravas were particular standouts the combination of food ambiance and service makes this restaurant a success it .
the food was cold service was bad my pork was really dry this place is not for people who know good cuban food .
very romantic great food nice staff .
just found a lugnut in my pinto beans i would recommend not eating here unless you like that sort of thing wow .
one if the most pleasant restaurants in the city best spot for a romantic dinner if the whether is nice they will uncover the rooftop its simply gorgeous paella was to die for .
how upsetting that this nyc puerto rican institution has fallen this place always reminded me of home cooking pr hospitality i hope they regain their mojo it will be a long time before i come back suerte .
just get the seafood paella by far the best i have had in the city .
eggs benedict was very good hollandelaise spelling was real hollandelaise dont get the corn beef hash though its more like the inside of leftover sausage .
this restaurant is on the expensive side but would be a good date spot the place is full of flowers and candles i split the paella with my sister and it was definitely good overall i would recommend to someone looking for unique spanish food in chelsea .
not the quickest service by any measure also a little pricier than other diners in the area the food was pretty run of the mill all in all an underwhelming experience .
awesome vibe great date spot .
great food watered down beer prices are outrageous 6 per corona good college crowd good place to go if you wish to overpay for watered down beer and overpriced drinks in general .
simply amazing food ambiance decor and service were awesome definitely a must go cant wait to go back .
awful too cramped too loud too much white trash if this place were to be accurately advertised i would call it skanks rus .
very good tapas place food is a little different from other tapas place would be 5 star if i didnt think it was a little overpriced sort of expected given the decor and area good service .
eek unless you are ghetto fabulous dont bother coming here the guys are pigs and security is horribly rude a little trashy for my taste but you are in clifton i can say the drinks are made quickly and not too expensive .
the drinks the ambiance and the tapas are all done perfectly alcochofas fritas are a must bring your favorite date .
good god this place is awful if you like having terrible top 40 garbage blasted into your ears while having a drink with the trashiest of jersey trash this is the place for you .
amazing ambiance the flowers are absolutely gorgeous i ordered the paella and it was delicious i will definitely be back again .
highly recommend tomato soup sangria suggestion passionfruit service is slow but friendly .
amazing atmosphere and delicious food highly recommend coming here for a romantic evening or date .
the food was greasy and plain it seems that the costumers were here to get drunk if you are going to the ironbound for great meal do not go here .
me and my girlfriend went here for our 5 year anniversary the service was amazing and we were treated very well tables are very comfortable food and drinks were delicious no complaints at all the owner very friendly and welcoming .
apparently not so good they closed quite a while ago maybe if they had used real butter not margarine and real cream cheese theyd still be there .
we loved our experience here great atmosphere food was delicious drinks were great will definitely here again .
tasteless burrito was almost completely white rice dont know what everyone is raving about i was super hungry and it still didnt taste very good vegetarian burrito was extremely bland guacamole is extra nachos were covered in fake cheese and were soggy .
amazing restaurant great staff and service food was incredible paella was awesome had a very romantic dinner and will be back again soon .
expensive for what the quality of the food is i am shocked that this place has received such high reviews i tried a variety of menu options none of which stood out for me .
love the interior design and setting especially the pink roses all around .
flavors are so mild both breakfast burrito and steak tasted like nothing mexican ever came out of that kitchen cheese on breakfast burrito is gas stationesq nacho cheesecheese wiz .
ive been here twice its really lovely and the food is really good but a little short of great both times we had to rush a little for other events but id like to come back here sometime we have time for a little more leisure .
was a solid spot then they decided to half the size of their portions my burrito just now was less than half the size as a standard portion used to order 2x a week now never again .
wow this place has got to be the most romantic restaurant ive yet to visit so far i had the free range chicken and it was so delicious the retractable roof was the cherry on top of a fabulous dinner and the servers were so nice and helpful .
i placed my delivery order well over an hour ago ive called the place back three times and the person on the phone has been totally apathetic i still dont have my food this place can rot .
that squid ink vermicelli omg the wife and i absolutely adore this place .
stopped here with a friend for a brunch we ordered granola and omelette the food was not as i expected after seeing here 5 stars asked for a fresh orange juice they served me with bottled juice the granola was very disappointing i definitely would not come again .
phenomenal tapas and drinks .
hubby and i find their food pretty heavy on the stomach a lot of repeating for several hours later their menu is pretty boring as well their atmosphere well lets just say there is no atmosphere brunch is nothing special again change the menu .
the octopus loved it the pork chop was very fatty and okaytasting very romantic and dark atmosphere with great flowers and candles .
underwhelming .
great food a beautiful place great atmosphere the sangria is wonderful i gave it 4 starts because of the desserts those that we tested were o k not beyond that i think that they need to add cream brulea to the menu we will come back for sure .
dry dry dry stay away the baguettes are stale plenty of other delis in the area to try wish we had planned better .
went for a friends birthday lovely room pricey but good wine list excellent service standout dish short ribs also loved the artichokes anchovies grilled country bread with tomatoes seafood paella .
only 2 stars for not having the option of ordering brown rice as opposed to the unhealthier white .
mmmm love tapas here more catalan style food so just a tad bit different than the normal spanish tapas im used to liked it alot .
the worst inedible food ever dont eat here they should be ashamed yuck .
wonderful food service and atmosphere could of asked for a better experience the pork belly is amazing i would definitely come back again a lot of candles and very romantic decor loved it perfect for a romantic night out or just getting together with friends .
if the goal is to stuff as much grease and fat on a bun as possible this place wins hands down you just cant call it good food that said rjs rocks though .
excelent place the service is very attentive the chef came personally to the table to see if everything is fine the food is just great you have to try the octopus we payed 80 per person with wine included .
we went here last night having had fond memories of this restaurant in the past every dish that we ordered we found to be mediocre at best this restaurant is not up to its positive reviews we couldnt even finish what we ordered as nothing was really good .
i never write reviews but ill do it for salinas went there this week for the first time the ambience is fantastic the food superb and the service first class .
all dishes are very very oily and too much sugar not authentic at all one dish even has sand in it .
delicious beautiful decor .
popular place with almost every table taken everything was fine however the salt content in everything is off the charts for that reason alone id never go back .
i went here with a group of eight about a month ago great food good service outstanding atmosphere in the back dining area with the open roof and lighting i would definitely go back .
maybe if i wasnt vegetarian i would have been more impressed not much to choose from that wasnt salted or fried tofu satay appetizer was dried fried tasteless tofu smothered in heavy peanut sauce not tempted to take the leftovers home .
dark and beautifully conceived drinks will run you 1520 per but expertly made and conducive to long conversations cozy bar seating area upfront and full service restaurant in the back great for girls night out date night alike .
food was alright but that rude ass lady kicked us out that very moment we all finished our food so she could let other customers in because of that one star for you penang .
service was very good here as was the ambiance small but exceedingly comfortable bit make reservations via open table if you want to be sure of seats also a large back room area with a retractable roof eat under the stars .
i went there last night and ordered beef curry and rice to go just now i took the rice out and want to reheat it but there was a wine plastic cap in the rice i took a picture .
this place is truly amazing interior wise but food goes beyond that i have to say its a must try location the razor clams left me speechless amazing the interiors are beautiful and serene and calming .
the thai food in this place sucks my mom can make better i have tasted better from other restaurants .
this place is a gem its absolutely beautiful our waiter was amazing the wine and cocktails were great we shared the paella for three it was so delicious will definitely go back love it .
everything is good until we got the fishhead claypot its so fishy that we couldnt eat any of it .
this place is absolutely lovely and the food is on point hostesses are a bit vapid but waiters and bar staff were friendly and professional its a new addition to my short list .
was in search for good arepas food was ok wait was extremely long had to practically grab a staff arm to get her attention for a takeout order place is too too small will not be returning not worth the wait .
great tasting food esp the patas bravas and the grilled octopus and the jamon serrano the place was filled with fresh cut roses and the service was excellent loved the sangria as well as i had both red and white .
overpriced and the food was just okay .
great place interesting food and they did a great job at waiting a group dinner love the decor and the ambiance it was fun .
salty and greasy food service is ok in restaurant but ordering is dreadful usually a wait of 1 hour 15 mins and no bilingual phone operators .
for special occasions luxurious feel to interior lots of nice details with lighting flowers etc food was very good but expensive with small portions service was below expected would like to eat here again .
we got seated all the way in the back of the restaurant received bad service and the food was greasy and gross .
a little dark but real and yummy spaniard food and good ambiance nice bar too .
good food but they raised the prices too high for a cachapa its a gringo price now for those yuppies moving in found a new place different area aint saying where .
amazing food decor and atmosphere just celebrated my birthday there last night and everything was delicious im definitely coming back here .
prices should be 24 less than what they actually charge 7 for chicha drink come on man .
yummy tapas yummy paella yummy sangria good service cozy beautiful setting very satisfying meal .
the arepas were the best you can get but lately the quality of them has gone downhill very disappointed in my last visit yesterday .
such good food and cocktails .
the sushi is ok not bad not great but the prices are extremely high at the prices charged unfortunately its not worth it in my opinion .
the coziest space with authentic servers and delicious food i found myself in a bubble a true escape i highly recommend salinas it was a seamless experience from the moment i made my reservation .
i do not recommend this place if youre going for a quick bite because they are stingy and will not give you good service .
i had a great dinner here we had tapas and split a main i love their drink menue i will be back great place for a date .
went to this place on a recommendation from a friend i wont be listening to that person again this place is a dive its small and the sushi was below average .
delish everything was perfect the service and ambiance is top notch .
did the restaurant change owners ive been going to this restaurant for many many years and the last 2 times the food just didnt taste the same it was good but not at the same level very disappointed .
delicious tapas great ambiance .
nice dining room in back kept worrying about my car because this is the ghetto everything was salty and just bleh waiter offered fresh cheese and placed on table found it on the bill for 8 in the end thanks wont return .
just discovered salinas and glad i did the space is beautifully designed the food was excellent and the staff and owners couldnt be nicer we didnt want to leave and look forward to trying the garden once they start opening the roof .
tourist trap go anywhere else for quality portugese food .
the suckling pig is a must try it is truly the tastiest the place is so warm cozy and modern with an abundance of flowers truly an experience .
so i normally dont rate places ever but i just pulled a crazy long hair out of my macn cheese needless to say i wont be back ever .
good food great ambiance would go back .
lovely place nice decor pretentious waitress with bad attitude food without much creativity they were tasty impeccable but lacking sparkle the pan seared sea bass was cooked to perfection but the sauce was less satisfying will not be going back to perry st .
my new favorite restaurant the food is so amazingly tasty the service is great the room is gorgeous will definitely come back .
carpet why .
seriously delectable food excellent service yummy cocktails we couldnt stop gushing over the food though .
went here for my wifes birthday i over expected from reviews and stories food was average and i had to remind them of birthday dessert many times which took forever disappointed for a very special occasion .
the restaurant is a professionally run operation the staff seemed point on the menu and food are foodie level of quality we had a great meal a great time a place to recommend go back to and impress others with .
i just dont get it whats all the hype about this place must be one of those its all about who you know situations to receive such high reviews i did not find anything spectacular about our dining experience here at 150 a person i expect to .
two friends and i enjoyed a great brunch here generous and flavorful dishes fresh juice and comfortable seating had some energy but not too crowded the server helped get lemonade for my friends three year old a good preposthigh line spot .
wow major letdown awful gave it 2 stars bc of the decor and dessert .
the decor of the restaurant is one of a kind my boyfriend took me to a romantic dinner here and we had the best time great place to have a conversation while having exquisite food and the best service .
had lunch here a while back service was definitely suspect our bald middle age waiter thought that maybe he was working at a 3 star restaurant instead of a quaint west village eatery past its prime food was mediocre at best and not priced accordingly .
great tapas in a fashionable setting .
terrible the menu is a piece of paper yes just a piece of paper the food was nothing more than average and the walls where they placed the candles on tables are burnt i usually dont hate on restaurants on the internet but this place sucks never again .
excellent place for a date went here just prior to valentines day with my girlfriend and was very impressed with the atmosphere menu and taste pricy even for a tapasdinner place but you get a quality meal in return the staff was friendly and attentive i recommend .
sandwiches are good but the prices change every time for the same sandwich we have a lot of snow but the owner has not cut paths to parking lot its terrible and they dont sell bread n wont sell a single roll .
worth every penny delicious richlyflavored classic tapas as well as some new twists gorgeous decor perfect for a date or anyone you want to impress or treating yourself .
use to frequent until i found a roach in my food this was several years ago and maybe theyve exterminated but im not willing to chance it .
an old favorite i have been coming here for over 30 years and it never disappoints the neighborhood is not that bad maybe it doesnt bother me so much because i grew up around there just go and enjoy .
we went here before a game it was so loud you could barely hear the person you were with the food was mediocre at best .
i really enjoy this place they have the best calamari the garlic bread is amazing a must try .
every time im here im struck by how its overpriced with disappointing food i think lets not come back why do we come back because its the only place of its kind in the ironbound .
very good italian food went here for my birthday dinner waiter was very nice bread was good and everybody loved their entrees the place was not loud which made it very enjoyable .
they put lettuce on their tacos nuff said .

absolutely great food and atmosphere been dining here with my family since i can remember everything on the menu is made to order and made just like your mom or grandma made it .
great food but the last three times we ordered from here they took well over an hour and a half to deliver to fairmount that is the reason for me downloading the yelp app well at least somebody made out yelp .
this italian restaurant serves traditional fare with flair the food is consistently good and service is always excellent this is our goto place for family get togethers bar drinks are yummy we always get appetizers main course and dessert and we are always happy .

i love librettis and have been going here since i was a little kid the food is always delicious although i tend to get the same meal and the staff is amazing .
used to love this place but they need to clean the oven properly tried two pizzas recently and they were coated with ash or charred too bad because the chewiness of the olde world apizza thin crust dough is to die for .
food was delicious and very flavorful staff was very attentive and kind i definitely will return again .
my boyfriend likes going here for pizza since its close to our home but i personally dont like the pizza here its too thick for my liking and its too doughy left me feeling heavy and bloated .
been here forever and a good not fancy red sauce italian place always consistent and never changes while certainly not the best place to go for italian always comfortable and enjoyable .
olde world was great pizza when they opened and have gone gradually down hill since i know they can make a good pizza they used to make a great pizza now its just average come on guys up your game .
great italian restaurant surrounded by abandoned buildings you cant believe this place is in this location but food is great love the chicken franchisee here .
not good more like the korean version of arbys big boy or dennys thought i could avoid the trek from western morris to palisades or ridgefield park when i get the urge for korean bbq but this place is more fast food than authentic .
this is simple old school italian at its best this is where the real hearty italian eaters eat one of my favorite restaurants .
never ordering from here again the food is terrible yukk .
the food is amazing and the restaurant staff provide excellent service i had the gnocchi bolognese terrific i cannot wait to go back wondeful ambience good for either a date or a large group of friends and family .
ive been ordering from here and i just so happened to find a big eyed mosquito in my lo mein noodles throwing this menu out .
great spot with good people watching during the summer we had great food and good service .
slow service with 3 servers and only 3 tables sushi was subpar yellowtail wasnt fresh and spicy sauce on the roll was unappetizing .
one of the top 10 burger joints in the us you need to order the rouge burger .
not a good experience .
everything is delicious you cant make a wrong choice service is great and the place is cozy just a tad hot .
stood at the entrance for five minutes without anyone bothering to even acknowledge us much less seat us we ended up going to pepes across the parking lot which was fantastic .
we had dinner here last night our first time here it was a good choice we had a burger and some wine burger was very tasty but overpriced overall great place with good ambience and super friendly service .
if you ever leave anything behind which was my sweater in this case they tend to throw it out the next day that was what i was told that they found it but threw it out .
just came here for predinner drinks great ambiance and service at the bar .
ill keep this short and sweet the food is mediocre at best the drinks are like juice the service was the worst ive experienced enjoy .
you can eat at midnight and excellent tacos .
guayoyo continues to go downhill the decor has gotten a rehaul in recent months but the service has lost the warmth of the days of yore enough to make me wonder what the folks at caracas are up to .
cool spot great for drinks apps and light dinner etc burger is good but overrated mostly good for outdoor seating on the square .
the portions are really small for such a price the food wasnt great salmon and trout were good soups carrot and asparagus were mediocre crispy artichoke was bad streak frit really tiny but ok also its also super dark in there .
food was awesome at this place and price was great just needed a better waitress to make it perfect took a girl there for a date and loved it .
stopped in today for a bagel never again there are so many better choices out there i ordered an everything bagel with cream cheese but there was hardly any cream cheese on there it was a little layer like how you would butter your toast not worth it .
the bloody mary is very good and quite spicy the burgers are a good choice the fries are good nice venue and locale but a bit on the expensive side .
i went there this morning ordered a bagel with cream cheese kid behind the counter says you want coffee with that i said no thanks he then says cmon spend some more money i dont think ill be spending any more there .
they are always so nice with great service and delicious food its awesome to sit outside on a warm day and people watch while eating delish food and having a good beverage love this place and recommend the fish tacos .
place is dirty and pricey for bagels .
nice place for a date very intimate ambiance i like the dim lights and french decor its a small space so its hard to move around i didnt try the food so i will definitely be back to check that out .
utterly filthy omg look around you you may as well go scrape garbage off the parking lot ugh ugh .
rouge is fantastic been going since they opened love the intimacy of the place if you want more lights and action you can go next door this place is fantastic grab a table out on the sidewalk and watch the world go by .
been here several times and food is awesome but service game sucks went this sunday morning at 11am was told a 20 min wait an hour and a half later im on my way to burger king .
absolutely amazing love their fish taco def going back for more .
the foods pretty good wings but the place lacks any charm it used to be hopping but now seems a shell of its former self too bad .
best burger in town perfect fries on point entrees and apps ditch parc too disney and sit on the square at the og of al fresco dining .
service sucked i had a completely rude server last night when i came for dinner never had a problem with one of new havens best before this incident but i can assure you i wont be going back thanks for killing it .
delicious cocktails not too sweet .
i have been standing here for 1 hour just to be seated i am so hungry and i wanted to eat so fast .
loved sitting outdoors for drinks appetizers on a warm fall evening .
dont get it this place is very ordinary and the food was disappointing i think this place gets better reviews because its priced well but i thought one could get the same quality of food than any run of the mill bar in the city .
excellent fries were fabulous loved the apps and lunch entrees the service was phenomenal .
the concept is great lots of fresh veggy sides you can pick and choose from but the execution is more cafeteria than restaurant not much care in the preparation of the veggies and everything lukewarm only if you are really hungry .
beautiful location with a few of rittenhouse square this location is a great place to relax and enjoy great cuisine on a hot summer day i agree this place is trendy and chic highly recommend it .
had the fish and chips was disappointed always had good food here just avoid the fish .
great ambiance great food .
gg .
very gay very awesome .
this place gave me food poisoning it frankly wasnt that great even before i realized how sick it made me if the food poisoning hadnt happened it might have earned 3 stars .
ive been to rouge several times and it has always been a pleasing experience with great cocktails good food and wonderful service im particularly fond of the cocktails that are spiritforward and herbal which they excel at .
i want to like westville but the food is nothing special i recently had a very negative experience with the delivery person i wont be ordering again .
i had rouge burger w caramelized onions and gruyere bottom bun soggy so had to consume with knife and fork tasty .
worst chinese food in ironbound their steam dumpling tasted like a dog food .
loved it this might be my favorite restaurant in philly i had the duck fetticcuni which was excellent the scene is comparable to dallas del frisco or the ritz .
i ordered the falafel sampler for delivery when it arrived the bag was completely drenched in oil i took the falafel out of the bag to find they were all completely smashed broken apart and crumbling not the delicious falafel balls i wanted but a flat greasy mess .
great spots for drinks with the girl or a pretty decent meal cant beat the view of the park .
unreal food but the delivery experience is atrocious they constantly leave you on hold for over 510 minutes when attempting to place an order so i generally hang up online delivery absolutely needed here .
in case you havent heard already rouge has one of the best cheeseburgers around succulent tasty and yummy superb and worth every penny .
strawberry pear water smoothie cant imagine this being worth 6 but well see it was unmemorable .
this place was heaven our waiter peter rocked and made for a nye to remember definitely try the braised rib chestnut gniochi did i spell that right the drinks were stiff and just how i like them .
the food is fresh but pita is too heavy salad has cucumbers which ruin the overall taste and the babaganoosh is yellow and is tasteless no garlic so if you like another yuppie nonauthentic place then this is the place for you yuppie price included .
a place to see and be seen great bar lots of eye candy for both sexes good food too .
i had the mixed falafel platter the falafel itself was yum but the tabbouleh and the israeli salad were okay i usually love hummus but it was just disgusting same with the sauces my go to for falafel was always and still is maoz vegetarian .
really good food here and the service is really good too it is pretty pricey though but the visitots are typically professional and classy and not trashy like some other places in the city which is nice .
i like their food from the truck better and last time i visited they didnt offer the quinoa salad here no go .
came here for brunch and lunch love this place great place for people watch dog friendly for outdoor seating i come here for brunch with my little doggie on the nice day great food great service .
not enough breathing space in this place .
shrimp was an excellent late night snack wine selection was good have a seat at the bar .
okay but frankly the falafel balls were raw inside raw chickpeas are impossible to digest and taste like walpaper paste with crunchy bits thrown in if all you make is one thing do it right cook you balls until done i dont care how busy you are .
the ribeye i had was cooked perfectly to my liking the ambiance was upscale but not stuffy the location in front of rittenhose square was the best for people watching while enjoying a nice heavy glass of jack .
annoying wont even deliver 7 blocks away even though they clearly advertise their delivery service please remove from delivery function .
the classic philadelphia spot great location good atmosphere and simple dishes down well .
when we went to taim today they were closed .
delicious amazing burgers of course delicious fries or frites if you will great beer selection it can be a more upscale clientele a place to be seen and sometimes i just want to eat delicious food and not have to worry about how i look highly recommended though .
this place has nothing on mamouns i tried it and found myself gagging .
stayed around the corner from this place for a couple of months and became one of my favorites in the rotation you must try the rouge burger with their pommes frites if youre lucky they might be serving the truffled frites yum .
your runofthemill cornerstore good selection of snacks drinks and tobacco products average coffee over the past decade i have consistently found the staff to be helpful but also rather rude and belittling toward customers .
love the burger im a sucker for gruyere cheese they have a refreshing lychee drink .
very slow service and the food was soso .
the food here is phenomenal it is a great place to people watch and see how the other half lives not somewhere id go everyday but i like to treat myself to lunch here once in a blue moon the burger and fries deserve the hype .
i have no idea who reviewed this place but it was mediocre at best nice friendly staff but i wont be returning .
i love this place especially in the spring and summer great people watching ive seen and chatted with everyone from gerard butler to sam rockwell the burgers are darn good and i do enjoy their cheese plate its a cool place to see and be seen 0 .
our waitress never put in the order then lied about it i asked straight out if she put in our order and she literally ran away after 90 mins of waiting our food came out and it was pretty tasty .
i love love love this place simple menu and awesome atmosphere i love that they have fresh new vegatrian specials every night i had the best pumpkin soup and rosoto this is a must try they also have a nice brunch and view of rittenhouse .
waiter took my phone while clearingsetting our table when confronted waiter acted confused and asked was this in my hand i didnt notice taking it although i can not be a 100 certain i think he tried to steal it do not recommend going there .
the rouge burger is definately as good as youve heard pommes frites are possibly the best ive ever had .
been here several times and tried a variety of options on their menu nothings that great at all all just barely okay sorry but only gets 2 stars .
rouge burger was very delicious and the pommes frites were perfection kinda stuffy atmosphere and service could be better but the food is amazing .
i have been to this place many times in fact i use to come here regularly sadly over the last few years the quality of food has decreased the food they currently serve looks meager while more pricier as well compared to other sang kee places .
i had the most decadent roast chicken here ever it was sinfully rich with creamy spinach and mashed potatoes i know youre supposed to get the burger which my companion did but the chicken was excellent plus great vibe view and everything else .
dont need to many words the service and food are horrible dont try to get there and experience it you guys can get better chinese food in chinatown .
rouge is red hot decor and food rock burger mac cheese and martinis are my pick .
disappointed with the food and the service ordered 4 dishes and none of them was tasty the waiter wasnt familiar with its menu wont come back .
pretty much a pulp fiction moment here a 16 burger well with the carmelized onions and the gruyere cheese ill have to admit i dont know if its worth 16 but its a damn good burger .
super awful restaurant the waiters attitude is bad and it always take 90mins to deliver a noodles soup incredibly nasty bad overall .
this place has some solid grub dope scenery also including rittenhouse square park and high end escorts dining there usually for brunch on the weekends .
to sum it up the food is ok but waiter and waitress are rude some dishes is too much salt .
really enjoyed this place i had a lunchtime eggs benedict and a super delicious cocktail both were fabulous our service was also good and the location couldnt be better i highly recommend eating your way through their menu if i lived in philly i certainly would .
food sucks with the same price you can have a lot better food the only good thing about this place is its close to the university city nothing else from time to time therell be coupons that makes the meal cheaper though .
i just moved here and love this little bistro we sat outside and had lunch great spot .
meh ive experienced better .
good place to go for dinner drinks or even sunday brunch favorites have to include their burger fries french onion soup and eggs benedict .
really really disappointed definitely not as good as its sibling location in chinatown or even the location in wynnwood the skin on the wontons were thick the taste bland and most importantly the soup itself just was not as good i wouldnt go back .
i take my outoftown guests here for the peoplewatching opportunities that the window and outdoor seating afford i heard the burger here was good so i tried it i was not disappointed .
i easily get disgusted with chinese food when its done halfassed either cook it right or close your restaurant .
i love this place seriously makes one of the top 3 burgers ive ever had but thats not the best part the mac n cheese is phenomenal i ate til my belt burst open this place is pretty pricey but oh so worth it .
its like a semifancy version of the small cramped chinatown restaurant but higher prices just a bit and bland wonton noodle soup .
always a great time food is tastey expensive but worth it because its always an experience a staple in this town .
good food but the service is really poor .
superb ambience on the square for a drink either outside at the window at the bar or in the corner good spot for cougar hunting .
overpriced and underwhelming tom your feed and drinks at other places much better very limited menu food ok long ticket times skip it better places in the neighborhood .
i still dream about the opportunity of eating another rouge burger its no wonder it made maxim magazines list of best burgers .
youve got to be kidding me pretentious inedible menu ridiculous saucecovered dogshit at 200plate prices stay away .
ate lunch here with my wife during the week we each got a burger and sat outside watching all the people walk around the street and square a little pricey but hey you are paying for the experience i guess .
wow this place is not that good to have an attitude as big as theirs the food is average want great food and great service stick with raymonds on church st .
havent dined here in awhile but i hear so much about the hamburgers been going here on the weekends to have some drinks really nice place the people seem a bit pretentious but not as bad as the place used to be i like it here .
this place is too noisy and the kitchen smoke takes the entire room the food dont even get close to compensate for the bad ambiance oh and they dont have proper wine glasses .
i have so many fond memories here the food is great the people are great its just good old school homemade italian fare love it .
im in from across the country and stopped because this place looked and sounded new and delicious unfortunately they couldnt accommodate a single and werent exactly the model of hospitality too bad went down the street to a delicious and customer friendly italian restaurant .
mr joes cafe reminded me of going to my grandmoms house for lunch the food was out of this world and youll never leave hungry .
minimalist decor sterile feeling for restaurant ok service overpriced food would not go back .
none better enough said .
i dont care for audrey claire lights are too bright the walls are bare and puse and the kitchen is wide open and loud no atmosphere at all the food is not very good or compelling and the service is lacking .
the best nothing negative to say soup is amazing the food here is absoultley the best i wont spend my money for lunch any where else well worth the money .
i came in here to try the duck forgetting that my go to place is closed on tuesday was not impressed by food actually pricier than my regular spot and it was quite salty looked good and smell good but it turned out to be meh .
the price seems steep until you realize you get a glass of wine bread salad and occasionally a special treat on the house very good stuff .
waited 20 minutes for menu then another 20 minutes for a drink lots of excuses for poor service good bye so disappointed .
bread and butter comes first and a glass of complimentary jug wine if you desire then a plate of salad to start your meal what else can you ask for bon appetite .
it was a delicious meal but my car was broken into and i lost a gps and iphone take a taxi if you want to eat there .
what a great italian american place its too bad the hours are so limited 11430 monthu 11530 frisat the gnocci set meal with salad bread and wine is a wonderful deal .
so many expectations but so disappointed in the end the place have a great atmosphere and a cool design but the food is just really simple and not really taste like it looks in the picture .
oh mr joes cafe i love you if you ever just happen to want dinner for lunch then this is your place its a full meal and a true south philly italian experience .
i get that there is a long wait for a table however telling me that i have to wait outside in the cold is ridiculous food keeps people coming to your business but customer service will help your business grow .
i love it here the kids love it as well its their favorite place .
havent had the food yet because ive been waiting for 2 hours when they said it would be an hour wait they need to fix their management and learn how to seat tables correctly its not rocket science too bad as i had high hopes for this place .
i love this place and is a favorite for lunches it has a great homemade taste i also like the neighborhood feel .
dont waste your time here they say 45min 2 5 hours later they were still telling us 45min for something you could get pretty much anywhere in new york .
cool low key spot to meet up with friends .
the food was whatever i can honestly say that i have never seen a worse waitress then the one i had tonight im furious even typing about it .
best breakfast burritos ive ever had make sure to stop here if youre in levelland you will not regret it .
meh ive experienced worse in the neighborhood .
this restaurant is our favorite restaurant period the decor is beautiful in and out the service is fantastic and everything that comes out of the kitchen is wonderful highly recommended for special occasions romantic dinners birthdays and lunch .
loved the look and feel of the place and the beer selection is quite good however the veltins pilsner tasted skunky and the duck sausage that i had with chili was terrible the sausage wasnt seasoned and the chili was watery disappointing at 13 great concept poor execution .
albeit a bit pricey blue delivers quality mediterranean asian cuisine with flare and an intimate ambience .
dear spritzenhaus i want to love you but im sorry 40 for two sausages a beer and a root beer is price gouging great space but alas thats all its got .
very nice dining experience delicious food and nice staff they specialty drinks are delicious .
they charge too much even for gourmet sausages and theyre not as good as the other place a few blocks down on bedford avenue great beer selection though .
the food is amazing i will definitely be back .
my first visit was more than a serious disappointment all of the glasses that were served to me were incredibly dirty with layers and layers of grunge i dont understand how the bartender or waiters didnt notice .
awesome gem on staten island sit out on the beautiful outdoor terrace and watch the tugboats go by its simply gorgeous out there the wait staff is excellent the food delicious lots of vegetarian options i highly recommend the avocado carpaccio and the blue vegetable terrine yum .
wuz good until they got rid of the table service and killed their brunch on sundays i say if you are in the neighborhood stop by if not give it a pass .
i really enjoyed this place the food was delicious i ordered the steak unbelievable the place is by the water theres an outside eating area very pretty the service was great and the drinks were very good alittle pricey but with it .
meh overrated .
i was told i would like blue and boy were they right started with delicious thai calamari and almost licked the plate then the shrimp dinner and it was just as good skipped dessert but will be back to try more items this place is a keeper .
decent but typical beer selection bartenders are attentive but soulless vast majority of crowd are condo dwelling twentysomethings dressed in business casual dickhead attire and sunglasses slutty girls getting way too drunk way too early and trance music you can build your anger to french fries are killer .
amazing the food is so different from anything else youll find on staten island great atmosphere great drinks and excellent service i will be back again and again .
nicely laid out venue but the food is really second rate we ordered 6 sausages each of them was lukewarm pretel rolls were nice but dont make up for the mediocre sausages better to hang out play scrabble and have a beer .
love this place so much we had a post elopement dinner here dinner is great amd julian has the coolest and nicest staff cana was wonderful and spent a few minutes talking to us after dinner .
this place was pretty cool until they decided to hire a dj that plays top 40 music pretty much destroyed what would have been a great atmosphere also they stopped serving the decent german food they had dumb pointless now .
ive only be here twice lunch and dinner the food both times was amazing and so was the service i highly recommend this place to everyone .
slowest and worst service ever .
price fixe menu mondaywednesday for20 good date location low lights good views attentive service .
nice space plenty of room for groups big or small the strange thing about this place is that the 6 drafts they serve are a tiny 14oz pour its like a tasting glass fix this please give us a proper pint or 20oz draft .
the appetizers were great but the baked clams were just amazing we ordered 2 orders and couldnt stop eating them could have just ordered 5 dozen and been happy .
food poisoning seafood special explosive diarrhea .
great restaurant good food very cozy nice people .
i was excited about this place and wanted to really love it food was below average and hubbyi were disappointed our server took note and took care of the bill hence 2 stars .
been here a few times the menu changed and i love it had a vegetarian dish that was awesome cocktails were on the money also highly recommend .
food was poorly made decor is weird and the they played the same four songs from the 80s in a loop come on .

pizza was meh i dont see what the hype is about .
place looks great food is good app dish portobello mushrooms and avocado was awesome .
definitely not a fan of this place my dog could barely eat the food rice had no flavor the pernil was greasy if you are going to go for fast spanish the dominican place on forest is the spot .
i highly recommend blue especially for lunch the food is fantastic and the location by the water is really nice .
food is okay but too expensive 7 maduros as a side drinks are also over priced the waitstaff were a little awkward and somewhat rude the service was slow and they forgot to bring out a couple items would not recommend it .
went to blue this evening with family the food was delicious the outdoor dining area is perfect the view of the boats passing by is beautiful enjoy .
this is a fine spot for a drink drinks are good not amazing but good food is really an afterthought not a dinner spot .
wow really good food great service had a blast with my family me and my sis shared the grill for 2 it was great prices are great wines of bottles variety is awesome dessert and the kahlua mexican coffee was great kid friendly too .
totally empty on a wednesday night at 8 staff and owner very sweet but food not very good we had empanadas gaucamole the tamal with lobstrt quinoia risotto and tostadas the tostadas were especially bland and greasy the rest was just ok and overpriced .
it is now open tuesday through saturday for lunch the food they serve for lunch is fantastic and the atmosphere and service are also very pleasing if you have gone their for dinner definitely stop in for lunch .
their menu is very eye catching but the food does not deliver notably the duck confit carbonara was not a carbonara sauce in the slightest it tasted like a watered down alfredo and the duck flavor did not carry through all dishes we ordered were at best mediocre .
delightful pizzeriastyle pizza nothing fancy but just solid and cheap my favorite is the white pizza with tomato ricotta and broccoli by the slice also you can order a chicken parm pizza its offmenu but they will make it for you upon request .
came here today for brunch their mimosas were so weak and food was nothing to rave about service was slow waited about an hour for our food i will not be back unfortunately .
i come here a lot they have good slices but the best is when you get a whole pie as everything is fresh absolutely delicious the prices could a bit less for the pies to better compete with the other pizza places around there .
another pretentious so called gastro pub to open in the east village well worth skipping service is terrible and the food is average if it even comes correct the first time .
always my usual takeout place love their sandwiches and slices especially the buffalo chicken and bbq chicken order is usually accurate and the food always hits the spot .
loud loud loud and unfortunately now a jock bar big mistake for a date pls move to sullivan street in the west village .
perfect pizza is the best french frice is amazing love them the best food sells there i always buy french frice there and other mealhighley recommended .
good crowd good location bad service never sure who or where my waiter is always discrepancies on my bill always charged incorrectly meh .
i think its the best pizza in the art museum area besides the high end resterauts vetri pizzeria osteria fiesta pizza is great .
this place blows i really cant decide whats worse the douchey customers or the douchey staff they both suck and the place itself isnt much better it looks like someone went to designarestaurant com and picked choice c the rotor pass .
the bread that comes with the salad is fantastic always fresh and warm i assume its freshly made on site .
nasty take out looked like someones left overs my pad thai noodles were all different shapes and sizes and they looked chewed up i will never go here again .
the chicken cutlet hoagie my god so good however i hate the trash area near their restaurant its like a horror show every time still good pizza my boyfriend and i nearly live on it .
chicken pad tai was meh if you like vegetables make sure you ask and also ask for a little heat if your into spicy it was super bland the waitstaff was very friendly and service was great though maybe i ordered the wrong thing .

yikes this food all tasted processed all soups sauces tasted out of a can wait staff non existent after we were served no one ever checked in on us next well sick with brookdale thai .
love this place we always get takeout since its only a couple blocks from our house but the food is always hot and ready after we order it the pizza is awesome but weve also ordered the steaks which are great as well definitely recommend this place .
super oily scallop pancake average penang curry slow service .
this place is great and open late and its always consistent awesome .
green vegetable curry w tofu broccoli huge eyewatering chunks of hot pepper tasted fishy very meager portion of rice service was fairly prompt blandly upscale decor .
only speaking of the pizza and breakfast delicious decent prices always ready on time .
horrible strange weird uncomfortable food is not quite thai if your looking for good thai food go to the place that didnt spend all their money on decor and none on ingredients tuptim down the street .
a friend took me her and i have to say the its worth the trip the pizza is just right on the money didnt know they did breakfast so thats .
the place looks very nice but the food was terrible and the service was just horrible i dont recommend this place at all the location and the decoration makes it attractive but was very disappointed with the food but wouldve liked at least to get good service .
work near there once a week and have the best lunch food quick and always fresh and delicious pizza is off the hook anything that i ever ordered was nothing less then delicious .
the food is good but really inconsistent they didnt honor yelp check in said its good only before 6 pm i thought that was a bit unfair it should have been mentioned clearly .
i love their pizza when it is fresh this was my go to spot when i use to live on the same block still try to go back once in a while when i go to philly .
terrible service the waiters just jump on you every minute to try to get your order fast and force you to leave very rude hated the whole experience momos are good but service was the worst .
its good pizza and stromboli everything else is pretty commonmediocre but who the hell orders chicken and shrimp scampi from a pizza place cmon .

a friend picked up some pizza for us from here and we all liked it a lot the pizza was just what i want for drinking with beer good standard pizza .
the food was cold the people working there dont know what there doing the price is cheap but i guess you get what you pay for i dont know why people would keep a place open when its being renovating there dust all over the place .
always fast and get the order right everything on the menu is solid online ordering makes it easy too you get 10 off your first online order too best wings in fairmount hands down .
i went back here again and did not like the food this time my food was way too salty also they started serving their awesome chutneysauces in plastic squeeze bottles now i dunno that kind of killed it for me .
best pizza in the fairmount area turkey burgers are are especially good always consistent .
im not a big fan of this place i know the food is cheap but they over do it with the spices i need to drink a gallon of water after eating there .
i love love love the pizza here unfortunately i moved out of the fairmount area recently and they dont deliver to where im at now but i enjoyed our time together while it lasted the dinner options are not my favorite but the pizza is really great .
horrible food and service writing the company .
i work right across the street so i frequently order lunch from here its always ready within 10 minutes the sandwiches wraps and salads are awesome the white 2 pizza with mozzerella and ricotta is delicious just dont order strombolli its a greasy mess .
we ate there few times and we never had a problem the food was good and it was cheap so no one was complaining until we saw a cockroach running across our table the waitress brought it in with the basket of chips .
it is becoming increasingly difficult for me to drive by here without stopping for a slice of bbq chicken pizza however i suggest you steer clear of the tuna melt its open face and i believe they use swiss cheese and its just all wrong .
tooooooo salty use to be good .
i love the pizza here i got a tomato pie which wasnt too bad it was a bit too spicy for me but their other pizzas are really good my hubby loves their white pizzavery aromatic with garlic quick delivery .
insane wait always rude hostesses we cant take your name unless everyone is here extremely loud cramped mediocre food only upside is that its cheap but you could just eat in the mall food court .
this pizza is everything good pizza should be cheesy greasy thin cheap just like your mom .
no restaurant is worth waiting 1 12 hour to eat will never go back the service was bad they brought the appetizers together with the dinner i had to get up an ask for a manager in order to get our drinks .
chicken cheesesteaks with grilled onions and extra ketchup slobber .
the place is crowded which gives the impression that the food is good its not this place is good for cheap large fun drinks and maybe a few tex mex appetizers however the food is very mediocre .
friday night adventure with happy hour at reds tavern followed by laser tag and bumper cars it was fun protip get one of the bumper cars that has headlights they go faster also i am a skee ball champion in case you didnt know .
horrible quality sushi the fish always looks dingy and doesnt have any signs of fresh fish also saw rat droppings all over the restaurant .
fun .
the place looks horrible dark ugly and out of touch furniture waiter looks like he hates his job sushi is ok but based on looks of the restaurant im not sure i can trust the freshness of the fish out of control roll is my personal favorite there .
mini golf .
food is ok great bang for your buck but the waiter is very very rude .
ive been here many many times since i moved to burlington the curry is fantastic naan is hit or miss depending on the night the service is about what youd expect at a small family run joint and ill keep coming back .
disappointing im a big fan of the vermont locations this feels like a poorly decorated hotel lobby service is bad and the flatbread is way off point id not waste your time money here theres much better pizza in new york .
we took the whole family here girls from 412 it was a hit the food was fresh and expertly prepared waitstaff was attentive and friendly i suggest the naan chicken pakora .
nothing special at all blends right into the town of numerous mediocre restaurants food wasnt terrible just not a stand out food experience bbq luso in perth amboy is much better imo .
great food great service definitely a familyowned restaurant was able to accommodate us and made us an okra dish .
i ordered a slice of plain pie to try out because i was considering ordering pies for a holiday party needless to say i did not order my pies from them the plain slice i had was black on the underside how can you burn plain pie pass .
great indian takeout love the chicken saag and garlic naan a little pricey but the portions are good and its always delicious my goto is the chicken saag and garlic naan i dont know why they arent more busy .
just ok villa victoria much better .
i have consistently enjoyed the food and experience at shalimar the staff is sweet and considerate although not always the fastest that aside i would recommend shalimar and its funky n winooski atmosphere to anyone in burlington looking forward to trying the sunday brunch .
overpriced sloooow service not worth it .
shalimar of india is burlingtons premier indian cuisine be sure and hit up brunch on sunday .
pretty average tasting pizza and definitely overpriced i suggest you skip rays and go down the road to anthony francos pizza in the pilgrim shopping center near the kings grocery store theyve got cheaper better tasting pizza and much friendlier service .
best chicken burrito ever wish there was more seating .
staff is rude and pizza is just your average greasy slice nothing special about it the food is far from average for the staff to be so obnoxious youd think they were the soup nazi with canned soup .
great quality especially considering price came here with a friend she got tacos i got the carne asada nachos the nacho portion was ridiculously huge steak was flavorful and good quality meat highly recommend .
way too dense and chewy a large pizza with pepperoni and mushrooms was a whopping 21 50 never again will i stray from naunas in montclair .
hole in the wall but the best burrito in manhattan id recommend the plain rice and beans one but add sour cream and guac literally the best .
not worth the calories you get what you pay for .
al pastor is incredible tacos or burritos this is my go to mexican spot in the area come here for flavor and substantial portions i swear by it i also appreciate that its a small business working hard .
food was pretty good ordered the veal but 4 a sunday night the service was sssssllloooowwww the oil vinegar containors were sticky the tables are super small wobbly the waitor was curtalmost rude not a place ill return to .
if you happen to be waiting in line for ramen next door feel free to jump in here try their steak taco thats exactly what i did wasnt disappointed at all the place is a typical ny hole in the wall with good food no bs attached .
very dry lamb platter even after adding extra white sauce its probably better to order on grubhub than actually going to the restaurant since the fluorescent lighting and black painted walls make you feel very closed in i would recommend the mango lassis and wraps they make .
from the west coast and frustrated by awful nyc mexican food this is the place that will rescue your lonely taste buds delicious .
surprised that this place got such good reviews here my food was well below average and i wouldnt order again .
really delicious tacos and nachos im sure everything else is great too awesome on delivery time too .
while the hours state that the place is open until 3 am they will hang up the phone on you if you decide to question what time they are open until while standing outside at 230 am great service 5 stars .
quesadilla suizas are a little greasy but good nachos are delicious nothing beats their chips .
pretty flavourless biryani and they wouldnt even give me tap water the bad pop music didnt help .
this place is really delicious and being a vegetarian its a great stop the burritos are incredible .
poor crowd poor management the food is a copy of the nyc food carts and it is more expensive than nyc lack of seating space the hot sauce is watered down version of sriracha .
um the cheese so good you know that one type of cheese that you always hope quesadillas have in it this is it loved the salsa collection quick bite to eat good for in and out .
whatever you do dont ask for simple glass of ice water they insist on maxing the aguaprofit and forcing you to purchase bottled water kinda makes you wonder could they be cutting other corners to max profits suck an egg spice end .
i ordered a burrito and the nachos i ate the nachos first and barely finished them i was full for about 2 days straight the food was good but its definitely more of a take out spot because there is not more then 2 tables to sit at .
overpriced teeny tiny portions of so so food i had the salmon which was the size of the bottom of a wine glass my boyfriend had some sort of shank which he said was fine .
its really all about the nachos at taqueria diana legit calimex all they need now is a ridiculously huge bean and cheese burrito and french fries because its not super legit until there is a carne asada fries option on the menu .
we were hugely disappointed with the food service and decor pretentious attitudes of the staff is what really made eating there almost unbearable overcooked filet mignon and dry risotto coupled with bottled water yeah righttap water made for a very dissatisfying experience .
as close to cali mexi as ive had incredibly tasty big portions but also insanely greasy all in all makes for excellent hangover food .
overpriced pretentious spent 100 for four tiny dishes the food was interesting but nothing spectacular eat before going if you must oh and byob even though the website shows a bar menu and doesnt say it .
best mexican in east village .
too pricy the dishes are fine with super small quantity just doent worth that much money .
great tacos order them with the guac sometimes a little dry without but still really good limited dine in space like 6 seats def a take out spot or grab on the run .
i want to open a tapas style restaurant ill give you an appetizer portion and charge you entree price oh and make sure you order 46 items to share and still be hungry after the meal best concept ever .
home away from home needed a taco badly since i had been away from mexico for a while and this did the job .
food quality was good unfortunately the service was very rushed and the food was very overpriced .
simple amazing heavily delicious went chicken nachos and the flavor on the pulled chicken was well balanced and had a true authentic taste portion too big for one but since when is that a problem .
i would comment on the food but i called for 20 minutes to order take out at 5 oclock and no one would pick up the phone horrible customer service .
small hole in the wall but food was cheap and tasty convenient location for bar hopping i prefer this place over five tacos as the latter uses flour tortilla instead of corn ps no rest room .
would get no stars if i could .
yelp does if again in nyc for a couple days and my wife and i were looking for a place to eat a late lunch we stopped in and had a few different tacos and the pork nachos very good food and cant wait to go back .
90 minute wait for a greasy overcooked pizza first time last time go to pepe or modern instead .
best nachos in manhattan vege option with great cheese beans guacamole creme fraiche and some tasty mexican sauces so very yummyh .
another new haven staple famous for what i dont get it it tastes like a basic pizza nothing spectacular .
great service very friendly fast and efficient it small with only 3 tables in the back however the food is spot on deliciously flavorful .
floppy sloppy soupy pizza .
the food was simply amazing but delivery took an hour and 5 minutes i will order again well before im actusllu hungry .
this place sucks so bad i wont even elaborate .
carnitas taco amazing rajas taco mouthwatering deliciousness queso nachos heck yes its got limited stoolonly seating byob probably my favorite new place in east village and worth the walk from union square .
the pizza was good but it took forever to come out on a night they were not very busy and the service was terriblehow terrible im talking we never got plates .
little restaurant food the typical mexican like hidden gem in the wall yummythe carne asada the tacos and so on food made of rich flavor and rich motive .
no air conditioning this place is a dump i barely could swallow the pizza because the setting was so unpleasant i dont think theyve done anything to redecorate since the 1950s ugh count me out .
amazing great tacos my personal favorites are the carne asada and the carnitas friendly staff clean and punchy atmosphere jtaime .
terrible sauce terrible presentation the worst pizza ever in new haven only reason i went there it was because i had no cash and i saw their visamc sticker but i regret it .
best burritos this side of new york the atmosphere is like a mexican drug house but the taste of the food really makes up for it the green sauce is awesome .
horrid a threehour wait yielded a burnt stale pizza pooling with grease our sneering bowlegged waiter told four people to leave if the wait upset them there were ten people in the restaurant inedible pizza oversalted .
these tacos are phenomenal perhaps the only place in nyc where i find the chicken tacos to be better than the alpastor thats insane i didnt even have time take a pic of the chicken taco .
not sure what the fuss is about the wait time is ridiculous the place is dirty and the kitchen has piles of trash and old can goods on the counters service is the worst and the staff is rude stay home and eat a frozen pizza .
quite honestly ive never had tacos as good as these next time im getting the nachos huge portions not much room to sit but the food makes up for the lack of space .
pizza is awesome it truly is one of the best however one star for terrible service rude and slow they only have one oven i waited in line for 2 hours then waited another hour and a half once i sat down go to modern instead .
oh my gosh their nachos ive had basically nothing but beef fajita nachos and thats completely okay with me they deliver quickly and its delicious my displacement from texas is relieved by taqueria diana .
not a fan the service is terrible the wait is excruciating and the pizza is just average i think people love it because they have to after waiting for an hour .
the most amazing quesadilla loved it .
no idea what the hype is about the pizza is just not good the only good thing i can say about sallys is that the crust is perfectly thin .
this place is closest thing i have found to socal mexican food in nyc we got that carne asada nachos and chicken burrito both very tasty and i will come back for more i heard their carnitas is fantastic will have to try it next time .
bleh the pizza i got there was nasty the dough was chewy thick and the pizza just tasted old the ingredients werent fresh either canned mushrooms the cheese was also pretty bad and the delivery took more than an hour .
best nachos ever no joke the burritos are pretty tasty too get it to gothe seating in the back is kind of cramped .
omg this place was my absolute favorite i ordered the chicken and rice and veggies i was rushed to the hospital with food poison i will never ever ever come to this place again i dont recommend it .
a hole in the wall but the tacos are amazing .
had there shrimp and yellow rice a d the shrimp in garlic sauce tasted like it had sand in it maybe they didnt wash it before they prep the meal i wont eat that meal from then ever again .
some of the best mexican ive had in new york if only there were more room to sit love the horchata and the nachos are the best in the city .
grilled calamari not bad but thats it noisy nasty asian hostess not even close to authentic greek food much better greek places around this was our second time eating here so it must be the norm .
everything here is amazing particularly el pastor .
this place used to be pretty good but tonight the food was almost tasteless ive never had worse hummos and the grilled seafood platter was mostly rubber .
cilantro spices chicharron guac fresca real corn tortillas my lord these were good inexpensive and quick but not fast enough that its cheaply made full of flavor .
a really bland and forgetful meal their menu options are quite boring and the food was pretty much the same our waiter although inexperienced was very nice .
amazing vegetarian nachos we were on the hunt for good nachos and this place delivered im not normally a huge fan of nachos but these were the best ive ever had .
can you really call yourself a greek taverna if youre serving frozen gyro other highlights included fishytasting shrimp and bland overcooked chicken kabobs needless to say we wont be dining here again .
awesome pork tacos yay there are finally some good mexican restaurantstaquerias in nyc the opened store front lets the wonderful smell right into the street and makes your mouth water cant wait to go back .
the cafateria enviroment was a turn off at first sitting i should have left at first sight the food was mere low level diner food i have eaten at better diners in jersey greek owned it sucks you will not see me again .
great and amazing mexican food for a cheap price friendly and kind staff only bad thing about this place is the location its very small who cares when your eating great food .
the crab rangoons are very good and the portions are huge but the pork fried rice is so bland with no flavor and the chicken with cashews is not good either also lacking flavor too bad .
best mexican food ive ever had and im a mexican food junkie i looove their carnita nachos this place is a mazing and the guy at the register was very nice and friendly i would definitely be coming here often since i work a few blocks away .
got food poisoning many of my friends have gotten food poisoning from a broad variety of their dishes do not go here unless you want to play some dysentery roulette .
best tacosquessadillasnachos ive come across in nyc so far portions are large food is delicious cooked to perfection space is cramped but thats the only down side so far eat here its the bomb .
went here based on the reviews here on yelp and was not stoked greasy chicken limp veggies and overcooked rice maybe we caught them on an off night .
this place is absolutely divine best mex ive had since i left so cal not fancy at all just delicious freshly made tacos and nachos one order of nachos is literally more than enough for four or five people .
decided to try a new place for chinese takeout was severely disappointed it took doctoring at home to make leftovers edible .
best al pastor tacos in the city the freshly pressed corn tortillas won me over along with the homemade salsa 3taco is a bit steep for a holeinthewall joint but im happy to pay it given that everything is fresh and homemade .
wasnt thrilled service was meh and food was just okay prices seemed a little high too for what you got in return only been here once so maybe it was an off night .
delivery was quick and quesadilla and tacos were on point just remember to order salsa cause it doesnt come gratis .
this place deserves a pass ive had better ribs better service at the union location i should have went to don pepes or bonefish grill down the street .
best taco place in the east village al pastor omg heard the nachos are supposed to be awesome cant wait to try .
terrible service never again tried it 3 times 2 out of 3 they lied to us bad service and my clams were rotten .
finally a mexican place in nyc thats comparable to the delicious mexican options in california do yourself a favor and get the nachos but also share them because the portions are huge the tacos are also delicious you really cant go wrong with anything here .
have given this place several chances and will never be back again the service is absolutely terrible and even after speaking with the owner he still has the same lazy slow staff sad .
our local favorite amazing quesadillas tasty tacos definitely add the fresh guacamole and crema to the quesadilla .
mediocre food and horrible service kept waiting for over half an hour to get the check and leave .
try the pork quesadilla with black beans and all the fix ins pretty delicious could be cheaper and could seat more people but hey its nyc .
went there for new years eve with a reservation only one waiter for the entire restaurant one bar tender after waiting an hour at our table to order food we blew this dump best advise stay away eeeeewwwww .
went back again the other day and tried the carne asada burrito i usually get the carnitas and again mind blown delicious high quality perfectly cooked beef mixed in with delicious and fresh ingredients wrapped in a warm soft tortilla this place is quickly becoming my graceland .
yikes this place was rough you can literally just point to what you want by the pictures posted and thats weird everything seemed dirty skip the salad bar wish i could recommend something .
best vegetarian taco in nyc get it with the works .
very poor selection of main entrees on the buffet had to ask for new plates to go back up to buffet otherwise was under the impression that you used the same plate .
hands down best chicken taco ive ever had its so good i feel bad ordering any of the other tacos except for the lengua when they have it dear taqueria diana please make the lengua a regular taco much love chun .
let me put it in a simple way a fast food steak house with low quality food but huge quantity to make you feel you had a good deal .
tasty and authentic mexican food friendly service perfect for a quicklate night snack very reasonable prices very small place claustrophopbic .
awful steak asked for medium pink got extremely well done steak poor quality buffet items all dried out cheap basically stay away from this steakhouse and go to the others down the street .
this place is pretty fantastic really small ive only taken out here but the food is great typical little place with tacos burritos the whole deal ive had the chicken burrito a few times and its 100x better than a place like chipotle .
got the food order wrong twice had to go back and harrass them to get the order right since they already charged us worst customer service ever never coming back if they treat their customers this way .
i cant get this burrito out of my head the rajas corn and poblano was a vegetarians dream no frills just great food im trying to find excuses to be back in that hood asap .
got the grilled chicken platter tasty but why was everything cold my friend swears by them so ill give them another shot .
this meal was unbelievable the best mexican food i have ever had the chicken nachos were superb and my wifes carnitas tacos were even better i literally woke up the next morning thinking about this food wish i could eat here once a week .
i orders general tsaos the chicken pieces were very small and rubbery which it means that they are pretty cheap here typical bad chinese if you want great chinese food i suggest head across the river to glastonbury try wangs palace .
amazing tacos friendly staff reasonable prices cant ask for more my friend from texas said theyre just as good as the ones there .
not good food i make such food at home .
best mexican ive had in nyc .
service was great certain pieces of fish were not very fresh presentation was unimaginative given the price levels my wife and i will look elsewhere next time .
love the nachos .
extremely proud and irrespect to customer once i didnt make reservation and they just said sorry we have no seat then just walk away immediately without saying any thing i dont see why i should tolerate such kind of attitude when i am paying that much money .
this is my go to spot for mexican food deeeelicious .
too expensive for that quality and quantity comparing with other sushi places do not order omakase because they just pick up from a la carte menu and charge full amount of it nothing special .
randomly walked into this place and tried their pollo burrito it was amazing by far the best burrito ive ever had definitely going back there again and try their nachos next time ive seen people eating nachos and they really looked yummy .
this place to me was just ok just regular sushi nothing too impressive although its not horribly bad virtually no japanese customers which is a bad sign i much prefer soto and michelin agrees none of my friends love this place either .
stopped in late to sample the tacos which are my obsession had beef pulled pork and al pastor not bad beef was really nicely done but something was slightly off the other two were decent would def come back here .
its ridiculous that id been canceled the reservation by this restaurant because i didnt make a phone call before the booking date i dont know why i should call them to ensure i will be there even though id made a reservation awful policy .
ordered the nachos 10 buys you a mountain of incredible shredded meat cheese and fixings stuffed and absolutely satisfied .
you got to be kidding me there is nothing special about this place food and service is completely not worth it if you want to try actual sushi try sushi yasuda or morimoto .
amazing i couldnt walk away from this place best tacos ever .
the sushi is very pure as this restaurant sets out to be however the dishes lacked a little imagination some of the fish was not the freshest i would expect which was very surprising nonetheless the food was excellent atmosphere reflects the menu a little bland .
salsas are so so good surprisingly find the chicken better and more flavorful than the al pastor which is unusual nice people working here .
huge disappointment come here 930 with reservation the fish is mediocre but thw sushi rice sucks way too much vinegar to overshadow other flavor sushi azabu is much better .
very satisfying some of the best carne asada ive had in a looooong time and the carnitas was tender as all get out well be back .
disappointed totally not live up to the hype went there at 915pm and the quality of fish isnt good at all .
inexpensive delicious fast great for a last minute meal pickup if you spend your commute wondering what will i make for dinner tonight then remember that you cant in fact whip up nachos and a burrito quite like theirs .
befuddled by such high reviews food was eh and certainly didnt match the bill needed real food afterwards and i love sushi and sashimi which is just better on the west coast .
best mexican ive ever had its an awesome little hole in the wall i expected good food as soon as i walked in .
really disappointed with the service here sushi was good but we were rushed through our entire meal given how much we paid this was completely not ok not returning .
these are really really good tacos better and cheaper than dos toros i dont want to be one of those im from california so that makes me an expert in all things taco people but i am from there and these taste like theyre from there so there .
save your money and time the wait staff was unfriendly and would not help with any recommendations we spent a load of and left with empty bellies and a bad taste in our mouths for the rude staff .
great food and low price nachos were the best weve had in awhile also highly recommend tacos with carnitas too bad the place is small so we cannot come with a big group of friends .
nyc review after seeing the reviews on one of the cooking channels i expected much better .
funny several people here have said it too just like a san francisco mission district burrito and that means its good tasty meats wrapped up with all the goodies the free horchata was a nice touch .
dont know why everyone loves this place thought the sushi was just okay .
everything is great particularly the carnitas .
menu extremely confusing as if it wasnt difficult enough trying to hear let alone understand the waitress food was nothing to rave about much better places around the city def not worth 150 for 3 people oh forgot to mention the small portions too .
excellent burritos and tacos actually everything ive had has been superb super friendly folks to boot affordable and quick and continuously exceeds my expectations dont even think about going across the street to san loco id rather lick the sidewalk .
incredible food but the maitred and phone reservation manager i think are the same person are incredibly rude not sure if this place would be worth revisiting once chef yasuda returns to japan .
delicious tacos .
horrible service charges for iced tea in a can .
fantastic authentic mexican style tacos the asada and pastor tacos were fantastic i imagine being back here many time to try the whole menu .
somehow razor thin slices of good sushi at crazy prices doesnt satisfy since eating an experience doesnt replace filling my belly .
excellent excellent excellent tacos the chicken is my favorite which is rare for a taco place im usually privy to fish or al pastor but their chicken is made from rotisserie chicken so juicy and flavorful genius my new favorite taco place in the city .
i have found that sushi of gari has the best freshest sushi in nyc gari is so much better than yasuda for a much cheaper price theres no point for me to go to yasuda anymore .
the food here is soooo good ive been stuck on the burritos but my buddy got a super suiza quesadilla and it looked so bomb do yourself a favor and come hit this joint .
restaurant is beautiful but run down and dusty smells of mold too menu looks good but food served is not well executed on service is stellar and views are great better to get a drink and enjoy views then do a full meal in my opinion .
finally a real california taco spot in nyc the tacos from the rotisserie chicken were amazing and i love the added touch of mexican sodas if only they had horchata .
i had thanks giving dinner here once it was boring nothing special we were disappointed and not impressed .
i enjoyed their french press coffee and the space was always bright and clean sometimes the music wasnt my favorite but it was a really coffee shop im sad that it is closed .
overcooked omelettes brown and chewy pretty terribleweird service and when you ask me if i want fruit or potatoes with my eggs and dont tell me fruit has an additional cost thats not cool bad food bad service wont go back .
finally a quiet place to read study or just be and its a coffee lounge that knows how to treat tea drinkers with mad respect nice tea selection .
they just pulled a latte for me in about 13 seconds did they even steam the milk even starbucks takes longer than that drinkable but they arent trying very hard to justify the 3 50 .
i go here to work regularly the workers are friendly its not too expensive and theres usually a spot to settle in its like the perfect distance from penn .
say what extremely expensive with very very little food on the plate i would not suggest this place as an ethiopian restaurant .
great service nice baristas relaxing atmosphere the quiche can definitely make you feel full enough to go but not too heavy i would say it is a ideal dish for either breakfast or brunch i like it .
the food is overpriced for an average taste the portion of food is very small compared to other ethiopian restaurants in new york the kitfo was missing some key spices and didnt taste authenticate the ambiance is pretty nice with a nice decor .
good coffee and decent pastries lots of outlets for phones and computers comfy couches as well as lots of tables .
grease grill had the fries with hot dog pieces and mayo sauce heart attack inducing menu i considered it slop the shakes are ok but nothing to write home about .
awesome soy latte and served with a smile this is a really nice coffee bar i tend to order old school pour over or french press but today i wanted to be different and had never been there before worth a visit back next time im in town .
incredibly mediocre food edible but would not eat again i went for brunch and everything was incredibly bland and unappetizing i am frankly shocked at the high ratings service is fine but food was not .
my favorite cafe in u city yummy biscotti and hot drinks with a super comfy atmosphere great place to keep the coffee flowing while you study or even just to grab a hot cup of tea and relax .
i ordered food from this place from seamless web i called after a hour because seamless said delivery time would be between 3045 minutes the gentlemen on the phone said it would be another 2030 minutes no apology terrible customer service never ordering from you again .
3 5 stars the biggest appeal s for this place is their cozy colorful interiors comfy couches and wifi coffee is ok their quiche is good the premade baked goods are fine too but nothing too special .
food was alright but seriously yo im sick and tired of going to cash only restaurants let alone traveling down to alphabet city to go to a goddamn cash only restaurant .
very good little coffee shop in university city sandwiches there are also quite good although its a small place plenty of seating .
combination of brick tile music sonorous kitchen and cramped seating makes for an awfully cacophonous setting but the food was good and would have been enjoyed on the patio where one could hear ones companions witty banter .
good coffee served traditional small cups which is just how i like it service was nothing to write home about slow deliberate neither friendly nor unfriendly .
yelp has great reviews so i figured i gave them a try interior nothing special cozy home feeling service was good bread plain and not good rissoto was descent but too salty 2 5 stars 20 for rissoto is all way too pricey .
best coffee in the area it is french press with low acidity also good friendly service and a pleasant atmosphere the kiesh is excellent here .
pricy and very dark lighting food was okay .
if you want the best latte around the university city area this is where you should go a cup isnt cheap but its at a nice environment where you can hang out or study .
pretty decent food on the cheap i recommend the polenta holy mmm was absolutely unimpressed with the pesto minestrone soup which sounds like it coulda killed it fried chicken cutlet and pastas were decent place is adorable would probably go back just for some drinks .
best and strongest drip coffee around made with a french press i think comfortable setting cool scene but not too cool friendly staff they also have amazing gluten free brownies but wildly overpriced bananas .
horrible service and mediocre food hostess named zina is truly dumb and has no sense of customer service .
so to the green haired barista with the bangin latte art both cups of coffee that i had looked amazing and tasted great i will definitely be going back soon .
im sorry but the food here is not good never coming back btw after 20ish min my stomach got missed up .
id be back here my brother and i sat and hung out here for a little bit one afternoon they had a decent tea selection and the pastries looked pretty good the prices were reasonable and the shop had a nice decor .
i just want to echo some other complaints about this place good food lousy service .
best cup of coffee you will get in west philly the counter girl flopped two bags of coffee on the counter and asked which one i wanted dripped doesnt get fresher than that .
the fish was very good however the portions were not only small but more pricey than comparable sushi restaurants in the city also the menu selection was rather bland .
french pressed counter culture coffee and ample power outlets make this my favorite cafe in the area usually fairly quiet as well can occasionally be a problem to get a seat though but its nice as a meeting spot and the coffee makes working here a pleasure .
ok so im not a big fan of fancy rolls but this place was just awful all of their rolls were sweet and salty and over priced in addition im still trying to get used to paying for the green tea 3 for green tea you kidding me .
this is simply the best place for coffee in west philadelphia and probably the whole city i love the staff and i love their french pressed goodness lovers and madmen will you marry me .
got taken here a second time and it was just as pricy and awful trust me never order the edamame from them bleh oh and in my last review i meant to say reservations damn iphone spelling corrector thingie .
pretty good coffee .
would have given them 1 star but they warrant 2 since i have such great memories from my childhood here other than that its now completely lackluster food is meh alright hours are absolutely stupid .
great place to study and definitely a gem in west philly penn area it has character and its quirky the drip coffee is not really worth it though pay the extra 1 and get their hand pour .
i dont get the hype pizza was too greasy and salty as you pick up a slice grease will cover your hand when you bite grease will drip from your chin sausage topping was like salt shavings with no hints of spice or sweetness .
spent a rainy afternoon here lots of light pleasant staff foods not bad cafe seems comfy and chill but i wish they had more couches .
a decent bar with a pretty good bar pie deserving of 3 perhaps 3 5 stars but last time there were a bunch of black charcoal things stuck to the bottom of my pie hey pizza guywould it kill you to scrape out oven once in a while .
good place they serve different counter culture coffees and the baristas are very good they also offer cookies brownies and what not the atmosphere tends to be a bit claustrophobic and its be nice if the hours were better .
most mediocre pizza ever overhyped bland and not worth your time if youre in this area of jersey take the extra 15 minute drive and go to santillos in elizabeth their pizza is worth writing about .
decent coffee place very relaxing take a book take your laptop take whatever you like ask for a cup of coffee you like maybe with some croissant and enjoy a great afternoon .
wayyyyy over rated service sucked too expensive for a small pizza people say they startavern is good pizza clearly they have mental issues and i will not take any advice from the people who say startavern is best pizza clearly they have not been to other places .
nice place lots of big open windows comfy couches a bunch of tables no shortage of outlets free internetwifi and delicious coffee i had a redeye i only hope i have more occasion to be in university city in the morning so i can come back here .
i spent 40 on takeout and was still very hungry after i ate the portions were extremely small and the sushi wasnt anything special disappointing would be the word id use to summarize my experience at yummy .
the coffee is good the staff is friendly and the environment is peaceful i just wish they had slightly longer hours .
not yummy if you like true sushi dont come here for example the tuna roll was made with what seemed to be canned tuna fish if your in the area kenji fusion is better a little more expensive but worth it .
i love this place heck just walking by it makes me happy came here with a friend for brunch the espresso drinks are delicious and definitely made with care and love i really enjoyed my chocolate croissant too .
ordered takeout from this place twice disappointed both times just not very fresh at all .
i am sitting here now updating my review with their improved free wifi same friendly staff and casual open vibe now pardon me as i enjoy my ice coffee and croissant .
below average sushi there are better options .
love it they close kinda early which is understandable since phillys no nyc but its sooo close to dormsapts wifi available cozy not too loud not too quiet perfect i recommend their exotic teas theyre all loose teas and as tasty as their names imply awesome study spot .
really 8 50 for a pint of guinness now 5 around the corner at mcgoverns and the service is a little better most time i guess that is for the better interior decorating here still a decent place for newark .
its cute the staff was sweet i like coffee .
terrible food terrible service lackluster beer list but always a good time with good company not a date place but its somewhere in newark to go after a day of work or class where you can be loud as a group .
i loved everything about this restaurant the service was prompt and courteous great wine selection enough variety in the seasonal menu to satisfy all members of our dining party the food was delicious and there were a lot of vegetarian choices im looking forward to returning .
while the food was average i had the mac and cheese with pulled pork the waitress here was incredibly hospitable and friendly not much else to say .
this place was great loved the service and the food the waiter conspired with my date for her to pay the bill and that wasnt cool other than that my tummy was smilin all the way home .
cmon elis on whitney is okay not enough to franchise .
great seasonal food and wine at a good price its a little loud but very lively fun place to go for a night out will definitely keep coming back .
this place is gross it used to be better but latley pizza always taste like beersour dough just nasty they need to step it up big time papa john needs to crack down on these indian investnent operations this aint 711 or subway .
just an all around great meal expected a corporate experience but was surprised by level of service and creativity in the menu all four at dinner were quite impressed .
most messed up order i ordered the works onion bacon tomato 3cheese they completely reversed my order with lots of onion and bacon and no tomato they didnt even put mushrooms and green peppers which by default should come with it so bad .
very nice meal good service interesting items on the menu nice portions ambience is very nice with good sound system and lighting definitely will be back .
terrible customer experience walk up to the counter you place your order and logically go have a seat only to be kicked out of it because thats for dining guests only if you accidentally gotten online to order something to go .
food and service are excellent fish was perfectly cooked they offer small desserts at a reasonable price i dont often find that ill definitely be coming back .
do not eat food here just go to the to go section and get your order there because thats what the wait staff delivers .
first time checking out the spot got the pho tai to go and was very pleased fresh clean nice portions def going back .
service is awful unfriendly cashier with bad attitude the black female cashiers name was lakida printed on my receipt too slow even for a to go order .
pretty delicious vietnamese cuisine not bad for new jersey compared to the vietnamese restaurants ive tried in nyc the plating presentation is excellent too friendly staff glad to have another option in the area and something different other than the usual chinese takeout places .
the service is pretty horrendous very slow and with attitude i ordered the barbecue chicken salad it was edible i suppose this is an airport and i shouldnt have the highest standards regardless i was disappointed .
pretty good pho and rice entree also good spring rolls not as good as the other spots though but is local they left the oxtail in the pho .
its not that great sadly there many other options i got the roast beef sandwich and parts of it still treated cold .
the best pizza i have ever eaten great restaurant and very nice people five stars .
horrible service messy restaurant not respectful to customers just not a good experience at all .
had their regular pizza with onion and hot pepper toppings it was delicious and tasty their service and quality was great .
they had nothing available in the menu besides the sandwiches very impolite and unprofessional service they get by despite the bad service because this is the only restaurant available in terminal a .
excellent food with very friendly ownership it has no ambiance and a crowded seating area which is why it didnt get a perfect score they need a better washing machine for their glassware too .
great sandwich however had a horrible experience waiting 4045 mins for a simple order that was screwed not once but twice before i had to catch a flight proceed with caution .
awesome food if you are hungry for italian you need to try the stuffed squash flowers .
food not that great for its price alcohol is way to high i got charged 12 for a mixed drink if u have the time between your flights go back to terminal c much better restaurants there .
amazing tacos might be my new lunch spot really quality stuff .
worst ever food is incredibly slow give yourself over an hour but if youre there that early just eat before security instead of at the gate .
simple well prepared tasty tacos the lamb taco is one of my favorites friendly staff too .
the only thing worse than the food was the service .
ate here tonight with my girlfriend absolutely delicious food had the guacamole and the enchiladas the mexican owner was so nice and describes the authenticity of the food just a great place .
are you kidding me 9 for a 16oz beer skip this airport all together especially concourse a .
my go to place for mexican in morris county best tacos around authentic and consistent can be expensive though .
this is the only sit down choice in a overcrowded and cramped terminal a i had zero expectation from my meal but with 3 hours to spare there was nothing better around surprisingly mediterranean salad with tuna was very decent and service was passable .
good selection of tacos and delicious guacamole seafood soup and ceviche use frozen supermarket grade seafood dont even bother good chicha traditional peruvian drink made from corn ill come back for tacos only next time great service .
meat in sandwich was still frozen for the price you think they would get that right .
the food here is amazing seems to be a family owned business must try enchiladas and tacos if youre into spicy food get the guacamole with habanero peppers warning you will need plenty of water afterwards .
anemic overpriced salad terrible weak coffee and a waitress with a major attitude mean i wont be returning to this place any time soon .
excellent a huge interesting menu of very tasty pizza and peruvian and mexican foods low prices good portions friendly staff and now tablecloths on my most recent visit the ceviche mixto was superb and huge this place deserves to be crowded but youll get a table easily .
the sandwich was a good quality however the waitress was rude and disrespectful plus i had to wait 20 minutes for a take out .
i had the steak eggs rice and fries combo it was absolutely amazing and wasnt that expensive im pretty sure they have more wonderful dishes .
my girlfriend and i split a bbq chicken sandwich here before a flight we have both been very sick to our stomachs for days now do not eat here .
little hole in the wall expizza shop now turned peruvianmexican joint that has good food the tacos are very good as are the enchiladas and cactus fries ingredients were simple and fresh and the food was well prepared very large and varied menu .
this place is going down the hill the dosa is cold every time bland they now give the lentil soup sambar for free but its like having flavored hot water as there is no taste the rice that comes with the chef special was semi rawuncooked .
very good loved the tacos lots of options i was in the area on business and found this restaurant through yelp i was not disapointed super tiny place but great food and good price all that matters to me .
if youve ever had a halfway decent dosa before this place will be a great disappointment my dosa was served tepid and not crispy the masala was bland and the sambar was really really bad .
just had dinner here last week and this place has the best tacos ive ever had comparable to miami caliber and the owners who also serve you are really nice the chorizo taco and spicy pork taco were my favorites and definitely try their horchata .
just a different concept of indian dosa not great food samosa was prepared with bad oil some people might like their concept dosa not authentic though limited menu .
excellent restaurant food is tasty and service is prompt and friendly ill definitely come back .
not worth my time or evening .
the best tacos .
the dosa wasnt anything like dosa the gobi manchurian could have been better sambar given with dosa was okay nothing extraordinary like my american friends recommend they probably havent tasted good indian food .
love this place not gloppy cheesy mexican but simple flavorful authentic dishes i have only tried a few of the many dishes on the menu but will be back often .
blah flavors blah food blah decor just blah not worth it and better off just going somewhere else .
the tacos here are so good try the alambre and the pastor tacos they also have great traditional peruvian dishes if you are in the area its a must .
food is alright nothing great the fact that you have to pay for chutney and sambhar pissed me off kathi rolls are just about ok again nothing great .
excellent for the price and huge portions the food is excellent and has a home made taste to it any entree feeds at least two people i have been there a few times and love the peruvian food the mexican food is good as well .
have been looking for a place in philly for good dosa unfortunately my search continues .
one of my local favorites for mexican food tacos empanadas soup salchipapas and that spicy peruvian green sauce i love to put on everything someday i might actually try their pizza but so far have been drawn into the latin food every time .
really pathetic food none of the menu items were upto the mark the food was bad the irony is that the name of the restaurant is chutneys and the chutneys were the worst probably the worst i have ever tasted no taste whatsoever avoid at all costs .
pork enchiladas with red sauce and chicken tostadas great .
dont go here the uttappa or whatever was alright but too much pancake and not enough filling for the 11 i shelled out and i didnt even get a drink the cilantro chutney is almost flavorless spend your hard earned cash more wisely at minar palace .
great food reasonably priced with friendly service just say no to taco bell people and come here .
pizza is good but thats the only thing worth ordering aside from that the 1964 decor needs some major updating .
i used to frequent the indian place next door not anymore this place is as good as it gets i had the quesadillas as well as the chorizo tacoes totally impressed go here .
normally love red robin but this time around the service was horrible and the gourmet burger made my friend throw up they didnt even offer to remove the burger from her bill after she told them i will never go back to this red robin again .
brazilian pizza of as many flavors there are .
unfortunately it has gone downhill over the years uneven service by waitstaff a red sauce menu that lacks creativity or1distinction sorry to see .
food is good not great risotto lollipops were very good as was the pizza the management william is very very attentive and accommodating only 4 stars because it shares a building and bathroom with fuddruckers weird .
there is a reason why this restaurant is always empty .
the food was really good but it didnt come out all at once and the server was slow despite our telling him that we were in a rush to get back to work we ordered nachos pulled pork sandwich caesar salad and red stone salad all great .
whenever im in ironbound i find myself back at cafe opcao for hookah i enjoy the atmosphere its really laid back the patio is my favorite spot i havent tried anything off their menu as of yet their service is slow and can definitely use some work .
my wife and i ate dinner here tonight the red stone tavern lollipops are awesome portions are big and delicious well definitely be returning on a regular basis .
the food use to be so good when i ordered the cheese platter there was barely any cheese and the chorizo wasnt even cut all the way when i tried picking i one chorizo a whole trail would follow .
guys stop being retarded and tarring this place on their salmon or their shrimp its a pizza joint have their specialty brick oven pizza it will blow you away .
the drunken noodles were not fresh it looked like they just warmed it up in the microwave and served it to us and the scallops with garlic sauce barely had any scallops i would give it 0 stars if i could .
ive gone here twice on sundays ate at the bar the food is fantastic servers are friendly owner always walking around checking on patrons typical bar and grill food but great quality for the price .
while the food is ok the fact that we saw a cockroach making its way to the table next to us makes me never want to come back here .
grilled lime chicken is a good dish especially for the price salads were nice and big there appears to be a good selection of craft beers and a decent wine list given this place doesnt seem too fancy friendly service at the bar for lunch .
great dinein experiences always however when i ordered delivery it took over an hour and when i called they hadnt even placed my order to be made yet very disappointing .
their chicken piccata salmon risotto are delicious they make great martinis too youd never guess theyre attached to a fuddruckers its a very nice restaurant the service is great as well i would definitely return next time in town .
the reviews here are way over the top i ordered hash and it was out of a can no way you get more than 2 stars with hash out of a can .
great food with a nice vibe atmosphere definitely worth checking out .
my husband and i have been wanting to come here forever and finally made it sad to say i was not impressed long lines average food thats overpriced there are way better brunch spots located throughout queens that id choose over this place any day .
nice decor had the roast beef sandwich best sandwich i have had in a long time would get 5 stars but they need to train the staff better on the finer points napkin silverware before the meal arrives prices reasonable i will be back and recommend .
been here couple times and wasnt all that impressed and not to mention the place has b for rating overpriced for the quality of the food and it takes a lifetime for the food to come .
went here in september and enjoyed the sazeracs i ordered they were made well and definitely strong i love the cozy interior and hope my husband who is also a fan suggests it for our next date night .
came here for lunch mediocre experience we ordered appetizers service was slow my fried calamari came out barely warm and tasteless my friends chicken fingers looked good tasted blah that sums up my lunch the end .
im not a big yelper but this place is special beautiful ambiance inside and great cocktails try the barrelaged mezcal negroni i could drink these all night .
not a fan brunch was not brunch hollandaise sauce was more like mayonnaise food was cold poached egg was not poached yolk was rock solid in the middle better brunch spots in astoria .
im raising my rating to 4 stars after several outings ordinary has replaced 116 crown in my mind for best cocktails in new haven their drinks are outstanding fresh juices the right amount of liquor intriguing concoctions wish i could go more often than i do .
didnt love the best sandwich in nyc maybe theyre better for brunch but dinner was not so good for the price and reputation of the restaurant slow and un attentive service also .
pleasant ambiance friendly and attentive staff as well as a creative and varied selection of drinks and food .
pretty sure the ham egg and cheese sandwich i just ate is going to give me food poisoning the ham tasted like rotting fish food safety is questionable at best this was a to go order .
my friends and i went here on a tuesday night for someones birthday and it was great the drinks are really creative fairly priced and delicious our bartender chris was really friendly and very knowledgable overall wonderful little spot .
did not like it at all the food and service were way below standards i do not recommend this place .
a really great place to hang out the bartenders are friendly easy going and helpful they have a great selection of beers the pulled pork platter is our favorite its just a nice new haven place to get a drink and some good food .
our waiter was rude and we were rushed also they play crap music really loud even during brunch the food was ok but there are definitely better options in the area .
great selection delicious gin and cocktails 12 bottled wine on tuesdays cant beat that bartender matt is wonderful and always carries a brilliant conversation with us can get really crowded on the weekends so get early theres coat hooks everywhere doormen are always kind .
tried it three times for brunch and dinner never had a good experience food poisoned twice .
service is excellent drinks are excellent but pricey food is also very good and reasonably fast this is probably the best place downtown for classy wellmade drinks from exceptional bartenders highly recommended .
besides for breakfast this place is useless they yse very low quality meat i dined here a few times but last night was def my last my meals have consistently been mediocre to gross also dessert portions are tiny .
amazing drink selection and of course food selection swanky cocktail lounge with a local gastropub infusion craft beer handcrafted cocktails local artisan cheese and charcuterie righteous felon jerky sixpence handmade pies best grilled cheese ever highly recommend for any night of the week .
id give it no stars if i could the mexican workers are slow and were having a full convo at the bar must have forgot they were at work food came 30mins later and honestly was very salty and the prices are overrated for a diner .
great bar i just discovered in downtown new haven so refreshing to find some place interesting and hip to hang out lots of great cocktails and craft beers on tap check them out .
im sorry but i dont get the hype the line is so long but there a million better places for brunch in astoria ive been three times and always left disappointed .
bourbon meat pies and some of my favorite bartenders in town .
brunch take forever to get serve .
my husband and i were visiting for the day a friend took us to ordinary our cocktails were great all around and the atmosphere was really cozy .
breakfast one sunday morning the quesadillas were ok but quesadillas are so easy how could they not be awesome the waffle was fresh yet without soul the tiny jar of maple syrup was real at least .
loved the butt sandwich and the cheese platter beer choices were either very heavy or canned craft beers service was 5star i would go back hope they might add a few more beer taps and menu items .
must have been an off day the waffle was over cooked the pancakes were too big and dry the eggs were also over cooked the momosas sucked also and they didnt take it off the bill so the waitress didnt get a tip .
awesome craft beers amazing cheese boards crazygood meat pies you cant lose this place used to be richters and the old half yards are still available but the new owner same as caseus has broadened the old menu into some great options try everything including the cool cocktails .
really we have to charge you extra for caesar salad so damn stupid it fewer ingredients than the regular salad .
decent little take out sushi place in the shs food court prices are reasonable and the food always tastes fresh its nothing fancy but i actually prefer it that way definitely a welcome addition to the work lunch rotation .
this is overpriced diner food at a renovated diner that plays loud house music simply put its not worth the 12 guacamole appetizer never again .
food here is great the people that work there are very friendly bagels are made in the store i definitely prefer this over the quick check or dunkin donuts .
i was not impressed with the pulled pork sandwich their other meny items for dinner looked alright i wouldnt say its the best choice for dinner in the area but ive heard that their brunch is excellent .
came here for the first time with my wife its christmas day and we just ate breakfast we ate egg omelettes with whole wheat pancakes food was perfect and service was top notch i will definately be back .
the food is actually pretty decent with a good brunch offer but its epically loud .
sister restaurant to flap jax in wallington serving the same menus and specials good breakfast choices and less expensive than the chains .
too dark makes me think what they are hiding food is not that great maybe they should of focused on approving the food the renovation of the place .
great place really good pancakes and coffee its a little loud but overall the place is great .
dont buy any muffins here purchased one and when i got home and unwrapped it it was green molded .
i have been going to the stack for over 30 years never had one complaint about anything always a great experience and the staff is excellent .
not the best idea to have one person working the counter at 7am i walked out man i miss new york .
if paula deen ate here she would have a heart attack because their butter is to die for my favorite breakfast spot hands down i usually order a couple some pancakes some eggs meatloaf and coffee yes i finish everything .
very disappointed we frequent this place weekly and just asked them to help out with an event in their town for our foundation haydensheart com and they denied us so upset wont be going here again based on principle .
went for breakfast on monday the service was fast food was even faster it was delicious i will def be bringing more friends here when they visit reasonable prices too .
decent bagels but the prices are too high and the deli food is old and rancid in fact pretty sure i got food poisoning from eating a sausage egg cheese platter from here do yourself a favor and drive the extra 2 minutes to bagel bistro for breakfast .
a great place to eat ive only had breakfast here but it was tasty and the service is wonderful .
very expensive and the food does not warrant the prices they are asking go elsewhere .
the stack is a famous diner for buttermilk pancakes the best i recommend diner because breakfast is served all day the owner and his team are very friendly and hospitable super bowl 48 visitors will not be disappointed .
the bagels are made fresh daily but the workers act like theyre the bagel notzies there are so many other places in the area in just a few blocks with better food and friendlier service id give them a 0 if i could dont waste your time .
had the hash browns with eggs and pecan pancakes was fresh and delicious the place had a log cabin feel to it found a new breakfast spot .
overall food quality was poor pasta was not cooked long enough and portions are very small .
large menu to choose from everything is good food comes out quick and hot portions are generous staff is always courteous i have been going here for years and never had a bad meal only bad thing is their desserts are limited and stale .
the portion is very very very small its like ridiculous for the price seriously taste is not bad but not good enough for its price never choose this place when you are starving i am not coming back to this place never ever .
freeking awesome food cools staff from so cal so had the country fried steak eggs bacon and hashbrownzers it was bomb my girl loved it too .
cons hectic crowded hh food is way overpriced korean fusion menu but nothing special no restroom on the main dining floor upstairs pros nice decor cool atmosphere friendly but not warm staff .
this place is great for a consistent breakfast come on the later side for breakfast if not u will be waiting on line .
food was decent service not so much there are too many places to eat in nyc to suffer with bad service .
two words pancake adventure ten silver dollar pancakes made into 5 stuffed sandwiches stuffed with fruit filling and add whipped cream on top coffee is excellent not 5 stars simply because this is all i have had first timer but i will go back .
eh the wings were good the service was terrible our watress was a little ditzy but she was so adorable that we couldnt stay mad with all of the hiccups there are too many good restaurants in this neighborhood i could definitely skip this place next time .
best place for breakfast hands down beware you will wait on weekends .
the ambiance is great the decor is cool but the service food and cocktails are not worth the trip very limited menu with not many appealing options i would not recommend this place or return there .
awesome breakfast coffee is excellent and dont miss the pancakes or french toast be ready for a long wait if you come for breakfast or lunch but well worth the wait and time .
not a fan weak on the toppings pie had way to much sauce to cheese ratio which made it like a tomato pie and the price was high i have no problem spending 28 for 2 personal pies as long as the they are up to par .
great potato pancakes nice early american decorum friendly owners pam is a cute hostess .
got two pies takeout they were small for the price and were skimpy on the toppings there are local options .
best pancakes on earth period .
overrated maybe ive been here for too many functions but the place feels like it serves decent wedding food not quite cafeteria but definitely mass produced somehow .
gsc is my go to breakfast spot before i fly to some inferior state cough cough california cough that never figured out the whole diner thing .
really expensive i work in the industry and i have to say that this was a poorly thrown together menu food was meh idk ive have much better .
awesome employee only spot at ewr food is always hot and fresh and the price is right .
the food is pretty bad we had a sea bass a halibut and duck breast the fish was quite tasteless the duck undercooked dessert is good but it doesnt worth the price talis is much better or zinc .
a very good value for the money combination of american and asian food the breakfast was great we will come back the cappuccino was ok but less than perfect .
yegods the food was terrible we were so disappointed so overpriced so mediocre save your money and go somewhere else .
the food is good its cafebuffet style where you can order anything i ordered the chicken bibimbap which unexpectedly came with a small miso soup there are a few tables in the front where you can people watch additional seating upstairs .
good food but overpriced and service is only average for his kind of money in a small city like new haven you could do much better .
perfect .
it hadnt occurred to me at the time but i am asian perhaps in consideration of recent events that better explains our treatment .
i like this place for lunch solid salad bar good array of options but im giving it 4 stars instead of five because how are you a gourmet deli without having pepperoncini as an option for sandwiches still irritated about that one ill be back regardless .
we show up with a reservation on time and waited close to smother hour the staff was not friendly at all for the price the restaurant was charging i was expecting too much the food was good but not worth it .
food as absolutely delicious and quick service too .
the food was good but i thought the service was odd have been to 3 michelins stared restaurants before the other restaurants truly make an effort to be courteous and professional didnt feel all that welcomed at this restaurant certainly not worth the 400 per person price .
tasty healthy wellpriced food for a quick lunch in a clean open space .
its an ez wait for an open seat the decor is splendid the food well its pretentious to the point of cliche but entirely edible nice and quiet .
great gourmet food fast service and affordable prices cant really beat that for lunch in new york when you want a quick bite .
blah not really much to say here other than the meatball subs are a solid standby the pizza is not ny style more like greek style this is basically a take out place where you can grab a grinder and hit the road .
my new office is surrounded by overpriced limp salads i miss you fork spoon the salad station always had extermely fresh ingredients and a great price for the small .
the pizza is good for a late night snack the chicken park sub is not bad overall nothing too exciting here .
this is great place for lunch in working day and hangout with friends on weekend the place is clean and bright you have many options japanese korean salad bar sandwich etc the food is great with reasonable price .
wont deliver outside of walking distance hard to call yourself a true delivery service otherwise .
i took my motherinlaw for lunch and we both loved it almost too many choices i wish i lived nearby to try all of the stations .
ive certainly had worse pizza but ive also had much much better pizza for what it is this pizza is overpriced it should be a dollar for a slice of this kind of stuff sorry to say it .
we had a good experience here read where staff looked confused by the order which they did but they got everything right and it was fresh tasty and for midtown very reasonable clean bright place would go back again .
tried calling to see what is the wait for brunch so we can decide if its worth going there was told they dont give the wait time over the phone why makes no sense not going there .
if youre looking for a good deli in midtown this is your place very clean tons of options from noodles sushi sandwiches to buffet and comparable prices i dont usually eat from buffets in this area because theyre always disgusting but this one looked pretty good .
nice decor but the food was nothing memorable i was quite disappointed coffee was terrible pancakes were poorly done .
omg bibimbap nuff said .
they doublecharged my credit card this is sketchy as hell and im not going back the drinks were good but how can you go to a place that tries to cheat you .
the usual morning thing for me coffee buttered roll they were fast and the food was predictably good and there were even a few open seats in the little cafe area up front maybe next time i will try some real food .
food is good location and styling are excellent front of house is hit or miss wait staff is rude overrated .
solid deli for lunch simple bright and airy i stopped in late one afternoon after a meeting in the area and picked up a chicken parmesan panini granted i missed the lunch hour rush but the place seemed impeccable and clean good find in the area .
beautiful restaurant but if you come to freemans you should know that you are coming for the ambiance not the food i came in a group and we are all unanimously disappointed in everything we ordered the service was fine but nothing exceptional .
this is a great place to get a quick bite thats fresh and healthy atmosphere is bright clean and spacious with tons of seating and a second floor which over looks the first i went for lunch with a few friends and we all loved it .
the sauteed venison is really just an oily breaded panfried piece of meat accompanied by burnt cauliflower overall disappointing food the decor is cool though lively place .
great korean deli big salad bar good soups sandwiches udon soup bar .
just experienced some of the rudest service i have ever encountered my partner and i were having dinner at the bar and the bartenders approach to her customers was appalling we will not be back ever .
when i begin a a review with forgive me father for i have sinned i am in food heaven it has everything for everyone and is in an excellent location my favorite was the make your own pasta bar this was my first time but not my last .
dinner was nearly dismal entrees served before drinks overpriced steak was small chewy and tasteless and the entire experience was an excercise in being rushed out the door cute wait staff and lively ambiance kept this from being a single star wont be back .
clean extremely friendly staff and the food is of high quality and is reasonably priced i like to get salads for lunch and the salad bar at fork spoon is significantly cheaper than pax i certainly wont go back there now that this place has opened .
after a 2 hour wait the service was horrible the food was ok expensive for what you got i read the drinks were amazing it was eeeh wouldnt go back again .
the cashiers are incredibly friendly the place is spotlessly clean and the salads are delicious and wellpriced for the amount of toppings you get and only 1 more for soup i go there every day for lunch .
completely dont understand the fuss about this place the food was okay the service was terrible i was left thinking the entire wait staff were on a postecstasy downer the price was too high .
very good place to go for breakfast or lunch the neighborhood lacks food locations that have this many options in one place not your typical nyc deli not only is the food great but the interior space is designed well and very clean .
went here for brunch they were out of almost every signature dish on the menu the service was pretty shoddy each dish 4 top was well made however none of us were too blown away the atmosphere is really cute and i bet much better at night .
found this little gem after the philadelphia marathon w some friends great décor with some cool people who let you enjoy yourselves if you are looking for a great bar w some good food this is the spot for you .
artichoke dip w french bread app yum inhaled it and burnt roof of mouth leek and asparagus hash main dubba yum vibethat polished shabby chic rustic barn feel attitudesevere and pretentious which totally ruined the experience .
pleasant surprise really great potato soup and bacon wrapped meatloaf fries super good too staff was also very pleasant .
everything was cooked competently but i could not find flavor in either the appetizer pork sausage on corn pudding or the entree roast chicken on spinach barely above cafeteria food not worth the price sorry .
highend bar food at good prices particularly for old city and fantastic cocktails had delicious sazerac and vesper last night the crowd is mellow without the skeezy vibe of the rest of 2nd street .
beware the restaurant which thinks it doesnt need its customers while the food and ambience are fine here i can think of many many other places around here to eat without the speakeasy bullst so kewl attitude barely even worth commenting on .
this place is wonderful truly a historic gem cozy lighting old wood bar ella nina and frank singing perfect for acozy date escape from cold weather attentive bartender try the fried pickles .
ive definitely seen this place hippp when wandering around the les with usually some girl we wander up this alley see the crowd laugh that we are not these people in the least and then leave .
cute little place good food service a little slow but thats because it was pretty packed will visit again .
the food was decent but not worth the wait on a sunday brunch we waited 2 hours for a table we wouldnt have waited so long but the hostess kept telling us we were about to be seated and going somewhere else means waiting somewhere else .
i love the music at sass on the week nights its a great romantic getaway that changes up the typical happy hour feel even if youre not hitched up its a classy yet relaxing vibe definitely reminiscent of the prohibition era but damn is it pricey .
prepare to be annoyed the food is unremarkable the decor is lacking and too many bloody hipsters .
wondering thru the local streets of philly and my buddies brought me here to try an absinthe cocktail in a word awesome thanks guys .
dank ass raw sausage it was so soft and mushy that i instantly gagged ruined the rest of the already semi gross food for me nothing felt right after that loud icky people at the table next to me were also awful just awful .
always love going to sassafras what a bar should be great bartenders good music and the food is always on point .
slow service average food sausage was raw asked for things and never got it burnt coffee loud patrons at the next table were the worst ever .
great for a date intimate and usually have good live music during the week bartenders pour good drinks and there are decent food options .
ordered pizza and breadsticks prompt delivery but after having one bite my girlfriend and i both agreed it was the worst pizza we have ever had i was incredibly disappointed and tossed the rest avoid at all costs .
great live jazz thurs thru sun and some other music on monday although have not made a monday night yet bartenders are attentive good and make great drinks wine is pricey but where is it not food fantastic .
pizza and sandwiches are ok and price fairly .
great spot for a special reunion dinner with my friends the food was great and the cocktails were worth it service was relaxed and attentive get the pierogis to start just do it .
food is ok i use to order from here but as of lately the staff owners have been very nasty and the food is blah .
awesome bar great innovative cocktails bartenders are very informative and friendly .
overpriced limited options seem to be paying more for atmosphereconcept than food which is mediocre dessert was delicious though .
i loved this place its classy and romantic i had a wonderful time sipping on cocktails and enjoying those amazing sweet potato fries oh yeah and toulouselautrec .
food ok service seemed a bit off and definitely pricey the pork sandwich was moderate no particular taste drinks v good .
lovely and they dont mind if i sip a manhattan while sketching for an hour or so .
the bread was burnt it took 35 minutes to get our drinks the portions were small and everything was very salty impossible to get our water glasses filled very confused staff and slow service needless to say will not be going back .
great burgers good beer selection on tap friendly waitstaff and cozy atmosphere my only complaint is that stairway to the womens bathroom is a little windy intimidating after a few beers other than that it was great .
i wouldnt recommend any one to come here i did not try their food yet i just went in to get a hot coffee for my friend there staff were so rude and give me a unwelcome feeling .
i always stop by this bar when in the area neil is super charming and completely hot upstairs bathroom is very female friendly .
had the pork sandwich and the beef navel soup the broth was great but the meet could have used some seasoning .
fantastic little tucked away cocktail bar with amazing music and what looks to be a wonderful food menu .
the food was ok but the service was terrible the roast pork dumplings were really good and the beef pho was tasty the rest of the dishes were nothing great rude and impatient staff ruined the experience a little .
the drinks ambiance and service were all excellent we were constantly entertained by people confused about how to enter and exit the establishment an arrow or sign might be helpful also the womens restroom is a must .
cute shop but no credit card machine and the worst flavorless broth for almost 9 pho will not return .
nice place to stop in they have a friendly bar crew and a good ambiance .
the service was so rushed that we were asked 3 times if we were ready to order food we were not finished eating was taken away and we were hovered over awkwardly after we paid the bill the food was not worth being treated rudely .
great atmosphere there was a little live music i was so happy i went there food and drinks were awesome had the steak sandwich w sweet potato fries and my husband had the ostrich burger soo good .
the waiters suck the attitude is so bad we paid more than the bill and wait for the exchange in order to give them tips but they take the extra as granted so bad dont recommend this restaurant .
we live in the neighborhood so we tend to avoid the neighborhood bars because so many of them are so obnoxious this place is for grownups excellent cocktails and burgers served up by very classy gentlemen i wish we had more places like this in old city .
consider how the waitress treat you the food doesnt really worth the price and the tips they ask for they have the say on how much tips you should leave no matter what you can get much more delicious thai food near chinatown jus few minutes walk away .
i used to be vegetarian until i discovered their ostrich burger its amazing .
the waitress came over and asked for more tip what the f oh did i mention hair in food usually people give 15 tip this isnt enough are you asking for more tip yes you dont ask for more tip .
decent atmosphere efficient bartenders sometimes music and acceptable prices combine to make this place probably the best chill bar in the old neighborhood .
the food is pretty good great atmosphere and a great location but it was disappointing because their staff forgot everything even when we reminded them twice staff are friendly but by the end of our night we still didnt get what we asked for .
delicious veggie burger hummus wpita plate they had good beers on tap and the bartender was very knowledgeable highly recommend .
just officially had the worst pho of my life maybe it was a fluke but the soup was nearly cold beef stayed pink sprouts stayed raw didnt come with basil either left the beef for last and it was still pinkish gray blech .
holy cow the ostrich burger and sweet potato fries were great excellent and unique beer selection i recommend getting a seat by the fireplace red drapes .
terrible pho accompanied by lukewarm service .
great drinks i recommend the sassafrass float 2 of those a martini and some sweat potato fries cost us 40 .
nothing special for beef pho too crowded on a thursday they squished 3 groups on one table and you had to share surprised at 4 stars cheap though .
this is a beautiful bar the last time i went they had a fantastic violinist serenading the patrons of the establishment live violin music while you drink .
still incredibly rude i popped in for takeout and gosh i cant believe id forgotten how awful the waiters treat you the quality of service here is unbelievable never ever coming back .
lamb burger i mean do i really need to say more .
rude and rushed service from the waitress beef pho was average at best and was served warm not hot grilled pork was pretty good but it was not worth putting up with the waitress unbearable attitude .
im a big fan of the sass great food great beers friendly service in the olde historic philly .
staff is extremely rude wont be back .
best burger .
ugh another yelp let down maybe offnight but whatev classic banh mi was extremely forgettable service also blew rude counter person find another job if you exude bitchiness .
my wife and i love this placewhenever were down there to catch a movie and every other place is overflowing with people we can almost always get a quiet table in sassafras by the fire place great beer selectioneven more so considering what bars surround it .
quite an americanized establishment food was below average .
fantastic bar fantastic staff fantastic patrons whats not to like .
does it matter how good the food is if youre denied the opportunity to eat in a 23 full restaurant whose patron youve been since its inception bummer guys .
went to sassafras the last time i was in town and it was a great quiet bar nice ambience good beer selection and a chill atmosphere .
i think its a bit hypocritical to pride yourselves on healthy wholesome heirloom farm fresh food but cook it all in blended soybean oil gross if you ever change your cooking oil to a non soy non gmo oil let me know id be happy to return .
sassafras is open again a real bar for real people in old city what a concept a large variety of beers to choose from and good whiskey too friendly bar tenders .
i dont get the hype its confusing overpriced however clean the location is ideal i believe its another emperors new clothes syndrome place .
awesome no other italian restaurant can match this establishment .
unpleasant experience waitress rushed us while ordering i dont understand why she was in such a hurry because it took us 45 minutes to get our california and spicy tuna rolls for better service timing and overall tastier sushi we will stick to daikichi from now on .
great food cozy place super nice hospitality and service and thats coming from an italian .
the food may be great but i cant say much about it as i didnt get a chance to try it their website gives a specific closing time we arrived 15 mins prior and they wouldnt serve us even though we knew exactly what we wanted very misleading .
highly recommend this place i have been numerous times and each time is just as good as the last cheap prices for large portions chicken parm is delicious and big enough for two staff is always friendly and welcoming small cozy atmosphere surrounded with brick walls .
the ramen had no flavor you cannot taste any miso in it the pork buns were dry and not tender i am never going back again it did not taste authentic id rather go to mitsuwa in edgewater any day .
delicious great service where they make you feel like part of the family shout out to dominicko .
ok if youve never been to a noodle house but if you had the real thing youll be disappointed service is slow and soup was not authentic i had high hopes since i just moved to the area guess ill keep looking .
old school are your parents old school brooklyn italian then go here and get some classic italian food everything we had was delish large portions .
way overpriced for vietnamese food they have one in edison but back then it didnt cost an arm and a leg .
i love this place is a family restaurant small but u dont need a big restaurant to show ur love for food and people we coming back for some more food and wine .
had the pho dac biet pricey yet small portion taste was about average very stingy with the beef .
this place is awesome food is unbelievable and the people are super nice i highly recommend eating here but make a reservation oh and dont forget to try the toasted almond tiramisu .
worst steak ever .
tried the lobster cannelloni and it was good only issue was that space was a little right looking to try the meatballs next time .
i had their burger ok wings nothing special and a duvel i experienced the slowest service ever it took 40 minutes with no exaggerations to get a burger on a saturday afternoon at 3p .
just happened to pass by and went in for some food it felt like being at a friends house for dinner had the pasta carbonara and it was to die for .
i did not like the calamari owner spent about 40 minutes kissing my butt but the food and prices are not in sync food essentially sucks .
great food service not too good and extremely loud very limited beer selection large portions and reasonably priced l .
ate here food isnt that great especially for the price do not eat here drank here a few nights why is the owner drunk and trying to pick up young girls the owner is very fake .
customer service was friendly helpful for outoftowners food service was quick meals were tasty and plentiful .
these people have no clue the beef kabab was tough he is using a cheap cut and the falafel was like mini hockey pucks if you want the real deal travel 15 minutes to paterson and the worst one there will put this place to shame .
two words lobster rollatini holy shit wait thats four words this is the kind of dying breed italian restaurant that makes your toes curl when you eat because its so good go .
just saw them drop a falafel pick it up and put it in a pita disgusting not to mention that i think i saw the owner take out the garbage and go right back to the grill without washing his hands never going back there again .
great food lovely atmosphere excellent service the pesto was my favorite .
sucks on friday night dead tumbleweed city didnt wanna go all the way over there for no reason so i got a white russian pretty solid 1 star .
love this place we have to go back to try everything and make it to desert next time yummy .
used to call it katmandont now ill just call it nho .
great neighborhood family style italian place non pretentious what the olive garden wishes it was .
we surrender i work in the same complex as rho and several of us really wanted a close option for lunch consistently we have been underwhelmed by the food and frustrated with the slow service .
the food was great i would give it five starts but the place was hot we were all sweating and they decided to not turn on the ac for some reason .
awesome food but the food cart has reasonable prices 67 arepa the dine in prices are out of control for the exact same food 1519 this place cannot command a 18 entree i was offended .
love this place great food friendly environment everything you could want in a little italian restaurant and the meatballs are as big as my head yum .
its almost a find very amiable service and the entrees while promising seem oddly sweet and to a strange extreme maybe its the region where the owner hails from .
very well cooked familystyle italian food in a cozy atmosphere the meatballs are very good and just big enough to fill you up for about a week definitely recommend not expensive kids friendly .
we ordered at 718 and now its 852 with no delivery in sight i called them two times for the delivery this is a little ridiculous .
brilliant food place is crowded and too loud .
its been a nice place for me to have lunch but today its noisy the waitress talked loudly near us ignore the feeling of guest i do not to tip but finally i gave15 .
simply delicious the wine the appetizer the meal and the dessert were all top notch .
worst delivery ever 107 minutes from taking my order to final delivery seriously .
excellent food and ambiance .
i am faked everything was way below the average .
italian food to its finest the pumpkin ravioli with the nut sauce is the best ravioli ive ever had cant wait to go back already .
it doesnt matter how great the food is when the wait staff and owner are horrifically rude even by nyc standards its simply not worth it at least not for italian food which this city has in relative abundance .
simply put this place is awesome dont come here if you dont value small places and with big atmosphere it is very small .
why were you closed both times i tried to come here during listed operating hours i dont like that .
love this place its a tight fit and loud but thats part of what is great the food is amazing it was one of the best lasagnas ive ever had cant wait to go back .
waited 1hr for appetizers at the bar they never came lady bartender was unbelievably rude a shame because the menu looked good .
great old style italian the food was on point and the service was excellent a family clearly runs the restaurant dad was cooking i had the most amazing manicotti .
the cook here was really aggressive with me i have no idea what i said or did but hen was so nasty really not cool .
best service best menu advice best homemade northern italian lobster cannelloni or bust super mom and pop literally grandma greeted us at the front door love it .
fyi no strollers which im sure many of you nonbreeders are jubilant about but on a tuesday evening before 9 when no ones even in there and i wanna take my mom for a burger with my sleeping baby gimme a break good luck sea witches .
best italian anywhere yes including italy puts those folks to shame .
smallest portion of lomo saltado i ever saw at a peruvian restaurant plus theres like 7 peruvian restaurants in west orange so it makes no sense .
highly recommend try the meatballs .
the most overrated restaurant ever cold average testing food rushed ordering line system and weird menu .
excellent food service and atmosphere highly recommend .
smaller portions higher prices colder ribs this place used to be great but its on the highway to crap .
great italian food the owner is the sweet older man hes great his son who has been taking over well sadly hes kind of not nice not friendly rude and insulting its such a shame the food is amazing .
tried it again still not impressed with the food not the tastiest or most tender meat ive ever had just felt overwhelmingly full at the end of my meal still prefer hill country bbq .
i had the lobster canelloni it was delicious .
food was not good at all fed the leftovers to my dog and she got sick too its hard to find good bbq in ny but this is definitely not it .
just like eating with family authentic consistent been many times when in ny delicious and reasonably priced just go its small so if your going before 10 have a reservation or youll wait a bit mangia .
this was my favorite place until me and my boyfriend each got food poisoning from the ribs different nights they must not be cooked correctly .
piccolo is now my favorite italian restaurant in nyc unpretentious check affordable check huge portions check owner who greets you personally check garlic everywhere there should be in generous portions check cozy atmosphere check .
ok but no one came to greet us nothing special .
i love this place go back in time and get home cooked italian food .
family friendly wouldnt let kids sit down at open tables while we waited in line to order their food .
house red wine lobster cannelloni with vodka sauce nutella cheesecake almond tiramisu all made for a memorable saturday night great family style neighborhood italian cant wait to return .
mighty quinns a bit overrated the food was just ok really stingy on the side dishes so you need to buy extra side dish for 6 and change for medium size will not go again .
piccolo is like walking into my grandma rosies kitchen and knowing from the glorious smells and open arms that im home its the most perfect little corner in new york city if you havent eaten here you must go now .
bad service slow and rude better places else where the waitress wouldnt let me sit down when my husband was ordering even though my back was killing me there were plenty of chairs as it was 6pm going else where for bbq .
the only place that i have been to that has been able to reproduce my grandfathers tomato sauce grazie mario renato call ahead for reservations folks this is a tough one to get into without them .
the brisket was very dry and lacking flavor im curious as to why they throw rock salt on top of the brisket when its served good bbq should rarely need seasoning .
great food usually a line def recommend .
yeah i just heard this place doesnt serve customers at smorgasbord until theres a long line so basically fuck this place .
great food decent service meh for the wine selection the food hands down is a five star situation they have a goat cheese ravioli that is out of this world the waiters are nice enough a little slowish worth going for the food enough said .
here is a haiku baked beans are the best fette sau is better on meat dry bread is too big .
excellent service food and atmosphere feels like a small town restaurant i ordered the lobster cannelloni with vodka sauce which was absolutely amazing very nice selection of wines too .
just had lunch here food was just ok and the surely waitress never really came by after delivering my food i would go elsewhere .
this really delivered good red sauce italian and quality service had meatballs and lobster cannelloni both good enough to go back for their house wine was reasonable in pricing and went well with the meal will return for sure yelp you were right .
ah cha cha cha cha wheres my sheleleh an irish bar that doesnt play irish music i prefer vaughans but this place can be fun when its packed .
like everyone says the lobster cannelloni with vodka sauce is to die for the bottle of house wine was a bargain and the bottle was huge and the service was great even at 1030 at night the waiter offered up his iphone charger to boot .
the place has really good drink specials and for pub food its not bad but i really wish they had fries on the menu service is eh .
gigantic meatballs and house red are total comfort items and we love taking out of town guests here for a real neighborhood experience we even spent a new years eve dinner here with friends same friends who introduced us to the spot a few years back .
the service is slow but the portion are small mediocre food bottom of the top ten in queens .
we were here with a large group the food was very good but its the staff that will bring me back theyre friendly and efficient and they made the evening more enjoyable go .
was there last night and saw a roach crawling on the wall .
this place is great .
if you want a frozen bubba burger with brown lettuce then this is your place enjoy or not .
try the chilean sea bass it will change your life .
3 beers smithwicks and a burger 37 not a good value the service from the bartender ryan was excellent the burger was ok but overwhelmed by the size of the bun fries and slaw were good overall okay but not worth the money .
for very authentic italian dish and atmosphere piccolo angolo comes very close just make sure you make reservation days before your desired date its pretty difficult to get a table on the day of .
great beer selection and service however was disappointed with my fish and chips fish was over fried oily onion ring basket however was great low marks on food but great beers and atmosphere .
great local diner food is fresh good coffee friendly staff i frequently get an omelette which is always cooked perfectly no complaints here keep it up .
great beer weak food menu .
all i got was wings the sauce on these wings were fantastic best sauce ever traditional mild .
international food fest stand in front of their bm location no service whatsoever to start an even greater travesty considering this proximity looking beyond this unforgivable shortcoming i got the only fare a pescetarian can garner at a gastropub and it was mediocre at best .
the montville diner is a stop whenever im in the area they make very good omelets and have high quality service .
i avoid this location like the plague there are always people selling junk in front and beggers who approach you as you enter and exit who needs this stuff when trying to dine .
best diner in the area worth driving an extra 1015 minutes to get to great food excellent prices .
ive been wanting to go there for two years but havent made it yet i did want to give a gift certificate to someone for christmas but ive called three times in one week and cant get a call back if this is how they treat their customers .
what is a period of time in montville without a visit to the diner i enjoy the food but like lauren had said you are certainly bound to run into tons of people that you dont especially want to see .
this star no longer shines bright food was mediocre as was the service the place needs a facelift and a power washing if you really are in the mood for diner food there are better places to go along rte 206 .
the food and service are still a big wow but ive never liked the combination of claustrophobic ceilings and stratospheric prices .
terrible service our waiter had to be called every time we needed something waiter must have doubled as chef coleslaw must have been sitting for weeks was pure mayo water food was eh wouldnt return needs a major update .
this is my favorite dinner spot in my neighborhood the music is always good the drinks are strong and the food is spectacular the shrimp moqueca is my goto dish ive also been here for brunch and its solid .
food fair no wifi if you ask if they have it they act like they never heard of it .
nice little place friendly staff i was in brazil last year and had great food this place felt very authentic the pado de queijo was excellent the feijoada wasnt amazing but it was damn good the caipirinhas were great interested to try their sandwiches next time .
pretty dang gross i had a roast pork dinner special and it was very fatty and also burned in some parts the mashed potatoes with gravy were dry yes dry also the waitress did not offer me dessert which was supposed to be included with the dinner special .
beco is the best .
veeery average food not terrible though i have eaten in and ordered out a few times and have never been blown away by their food i would skip it unless theres no other option .
brunch is amazing eggs florentine was perfect something about the english muffin they use plus the hollandaise sauce isnt too creamy drink a bloody mary or a papaya mimosa then order the fruit salad while you sip your espresso youre set for the day .
stopped for a quick bite on our way to boston on a friday night efficient service casual atmosphere a pizza is a grease and salt fest poor quality ingredients bad quality .
i have eaten the bauru steak sandwhich here several times and it is amazing staff are very friendly and totally reflect the south american vibe there was live music a 3 hour happy hour aswell which was pretty darn funky .
we four thought the chicken inedible and eggplant execrable pizza crust not crisp would never go back yuck i dont understand the praise im sticking with pepe maybe july 6 is a bad day .
everything about this place is amazing the food the drinks and the people .
greasy and salty .
very lovely simple reasonable food in a pleasant indooroutdoor setting i especially recommend the filet the pao de quejo and the four choices platter its on a quiet street the staff are friendly .
i really dont understand the hype about modern apizza been there a handful of times and underwhelmed with each experience overcooked personally if i am in new haven for pie ill go to pepes modern is the place to go if you like burnt crust .
love love this place the food the drinks the music the energy all fantastic we will visit every chance we get .
decided to try modern on our annual yale visit this year and was totally disappointed the clams casino was ok but the italian bomb was a greasy mess the dough was soaked throughout and floppy going back to grand apizza next year .
have never had something here i didnt like great lattes great pastries cece cela delicious brunch and caipirinhas and badass dinners its even good as take out sooooo brooklyn and quite a scene at brunch nothing fancy and thats the point highly recommend .
one word meh if meh excites you then this is your spot pepes does it so much better its impossible to know where to start crust sauce or toppings save your money and go to a religious experience over a mediocre spot .
this is a small place that packs a punch try the feijoada with shrimp and a guarana antartica soda .
greasy pizza soggycentered and burntedged crust and an oddly condescending waiter combined to make this a notsomemorable meal it was saved by the company .
pao de queijo is perfect and made to order the fejoada lunch portion left me in a food coma the only negative is the lack of ac on a hot summer day but a shady spot and a breeze made for a pleasant meal anyway .
i honestly dont get the hype over new haven style pizza the ingredients taste cheap the dough is too chewy the sauce weak it taste like an average pizza from any corner store in nyc .
pure pleasure to hang and eat here with friends atmosphere is pretty cool awesome people waiter you coolness in its nutshell .
pretty good pizza not the best though .
love this place i live close by and go all the time they are open all day too so great for lunch the staff is always so nice and smiley the food is solid and consistent and just a place that im really happy to have close by .
bad bad bad i ordered two large pizzas for takeout both were terrible and tasted like crap will not return or recommend .
passion fruit juice filet mignon makes the perfect brunch friendly staff is a big plus .
slow service just ok pizza frank pepes is much better .
great brunch place in the neighborhood the staff is very friendly and the food is excellent my fave is the feijoada a brazillian stew with bacon rice and some salad yumm the brunch comes with coffee and a drink sometimes they also have live music there .
burnt veggie bomb and eggplant pizzas boring marinara crust not standing up to the toppings huge disappointment and waste of 37 for two pizzas fav pizza places are pappas in stamford and jordans in norwalk modern doesnt even compete .
love this place for breakfast or brunch can never pass up the feijoada .
i dont understand the hype the pizza was mediocre greasy and inferior to most chain delivery pizza places just save yourself the wait and get delivery from dominos instead bar pizza in new haven is far superior this just seems to be one of those famousbecauseitsfamous places .
been here many many times and have gotten most of the food on the menu cheese balls salada de roca rice and beans granola eggs benedict are to die for cheap tasty and fun .
pizza was soggy with grease and atmosphere was nothing special definately head toward sallys or pepes if in new haven service was much friendlier at modern though .
amazing food my only gripe is the portions are smaller when dining in than taking out the takeout portions seemed also twice the amount lovely atmosphere nice place to sit outside .
so what if this place is less crowded than sallys or pepes id rather wait in line for an hour than watch my toppings even if the topping is only cheese slide off a wet swampy crust .
authentic brazilian feeling good food and drinks reasonably priced and great people i love this place .
i am sorry but i think that their crust is one step up from tasting like crackers this is not the best pizza in new haven by any stretch of the imagination .
great place great food great caipirinha todo bem .
calm down extremely overrated the wings and cheese fries are okay ive had better the sirloin burger was burned and you can taste the char which was not good the waiter was very unpleasant .
fun place and great food .
didnt like everything was overcooked and took forever to arrive burnt hamburger buns turkey burger was crispy outside and soft and mealy inside no salt on fries and wings were just ok .
this place is awesome make sure to order the authentic brazilian food the beers are great as well .
disgusting burger that tasted like gasoline low quality meat terrible service took a long time and mixed up our order cant imagine how this place gets four stars .
honestly this place wasnt what i expected the place is tiny which is fine but the menu seemed quite limited and its cash only the drink menu was good and the capirhena i had was marvelous in fact i had two .
wings are good but very disappointed with the bison burger over cooked taste burnt and the bread was hard it wasnt something that i would order again this is basically a place to go and pig out on wings .
loved the food drinks and service was super friendly one of my new favorite spots in ny .
this place is overrated i had really high hopes for this place but the meat and veggie burgers were a let down the angus was medium cooked but lacked flavor my friends turkey burger was burnt and the service didnt make up for the food .
great friendly people no attitude easy going even when busy eat in pickup or sit at the bar for a drink no worries the food perfect favorite dishes moqueca and bauru .
wasnt good sorry but out waited was very nice .
only been for brunch ill party with those steak and eggs all day them beans is good and yeah i want some passion fruit with my morning cachaca .
i dont understand why you would take good usda grade ground beef and dip it in a container of hot seasoning and grill it it was so spicy i couldnt enjoy the meat i so wanted to enjoy this and i couldnt go next door to blue ribbon .
i have such an overwhelming love for this place they are lovely people the food is absolutely amazing and consistent and they have a happy hour on sunday afternoons i love them .
totally disappointing whats wrong with everyone if its summer fire up your own grill in the park if its winter go to any real diner .
had the moqueca pao de quiejo strawberry caipirinha eggplant dip flan oink oink all were delicious and ive had a lot of brazilian food also enjoyed the music mix playing and the ambiance para bens .
this place blows i was on my way to brasilia and made the mistake of stopping here instead ordered the chopped combo there was barely any meat in the entree and it lacked flavor .
eggs florentine was yummy and the drinks are stong cant wait to go back for more .
i give this place a hearty ehhhh my tacos were underwhelming the beans were flavorless and the rice was undercooked the guy behind the counter couldnt have been less interested all in all it had a very fast food feel very disappointing .
mmmmm cheese breadd .
food was fresh and creative however i found that the flavor profiles were lacking i love mexican street food and this was a decent attempt at it however it fell short of my expectations in the taste dept .
we came here for dinner and it made me want to die in a brazilians arms honestly everything on the menu is good so follow your fat little heart also please dont skip on the cheese bread because it will make you reprioritize what you thought was life .
overrated and overpriced the lack of ac in this sizzling weather was ominous college kids waitressing here need to learn some peopleskills stay away or better yet just head out to a greasy diner pronto youll get better value for money over there .
went her for brunch good food great and fast service waitresses were friendly and good atmosphere definitely recommended .
ok food but harder to get in than heaven i dont want to compete for food on the weekends and yes i am a local carry on hipsters .
really great service food and awesome bloody marries makes me wish i still lived in brooklyn .
its really just an average breakfast place standard breakfast that is decent but it is nothing to write home about i am confused why people rate it so high your money would be better spent at chefs corner .
spectacular for breakfast .
the owner with the glasses is an asshole he was talking shit about me in lebanese to the server and looking away when i noticed them staring the food is good but service is always lacking wont be back for a third time .
brunch amazing do it i had the omelette perfect my brother had the steak and eggs divine to top it all off the staff including our lovely waitress tricia were fantastic .
2 00 for a piece of tasteless cardboard only positive point was that it wasnt greasy the man making the pizza has been looking across the street at that empty lot for too many years because his pizza tastes just as empty .
great eggs and benedict .
horrible pizza no taste other reviews must be from friends and family san vito and pizza masters are much better .
top 5 fav places in ny i heart you beco .
tried it today expected ny like pizza not nearly the experience people jersey dont know pizza .
good feijoada but not better than casa in the west village get the almond joia for dessert good service and friendly bartender .
the delivery was a large lukewarm hawaiian pizza with old pieces of pineapples barely any cheese and a non crispy crust maybe walkin slices are better but not very good delivery i think ill head out out of town next time for ny style pizza .
ive come here for brunch about three or four times i absolutely love the steak eggs the rice is always perfectly cooked which is extremely important to me the staff is prompt friendly .
i ordered the pasta and meatballs the meatballs were very over herbed sauce was okay i also ordered the cheesecake the crust was hard and difficult to break with a fork all in all it was okay .
delicious real brazilian modern food im brazilian so i can say that courteous staff great music awesome casual vibe go early on weekend afternoons if you bring your child .
so if u get a bug in your drink at this place dont expect 2 get a new drink the waiter will probably just try 2 get the bug out wa straw yuck happen 2 my friend this evening when we went for drinks gross .
small place with outdoor seats for a few with well presented seafood and sandwiches .
i would have given it only one star but the place is so pretty i added the second disappointing pizza decent calamari appetizer bad caprese they used pimento instead of tomatowhy mediocre food at best wont be back .
i love this place i have been here twice in the past 2 weeks the food deeelish the service is great and the atmosphere is super charming may i recommend the carioca oh and they have a a great happy hour 5 caipirinha nuff said .
disappointed with the bread and the pizzas i was expecting more after hearing so many good things about it id say the pasta and other meals looked promising .
one sentence review if you love garlic there is no reason why you shouldnt go here .
boy were the portions small at least theyre doing their part to counter obesity .
beco is a couple blocks from my apartment and has become my goto restaurant it has also become my first date restaurant the atmosphere is great food is great and the servers are very friendly every experience ive had is amazing and i will continue to go back .
the place looks cozy but the crepe i had was not as good as i expected ive had crepes at other places through out nyc that have been much better the customer service was poor .
this place really reminds me of being back in brazil it has a totally laid back vibe and is a great place to get some snacks some drinks and watch some futebol on the weekends you can check out my full review on poweranimals poweranimals com20110… .
dont go in a group of three only go in twos or fours just got turned away at the door with my group of three by a very rude waitress with no option to wait unfortunate .
perfect friendly place .
the service was horrible we were seated for 10 minutes before the waiter came by with the menu and water they gave us such an attitude when we wanted to share the crepe this place is cash only i will probably not come here again .
great atmosphere amazing ownership and awesome food this place is exactly what this wee neighborhood needed a chill affordable and welcoming spot .
bland steak n eggs flavorless sauce fully over cooked fries chicken and waffles were mediocre at best i dint k ow if this was a one time deal but overall disappointed with the food .
update get the steak and eggs so delicious .
it only got more expensive but not better compared to its previous incarnation at this location everything the same except for logo smaller portion and really expensive booze and louder but worse music next will be broadway cuisina geez .
amazing brunch special entree coffee alcoholic drink 1 free refill i recommend the french toast and the steak and eggs atmosphere really feels like brazil i imagine .
literally the worst dining experience i have ever had in my life the food was god awful and the service was disgraceful our waitress jaime was argumentative and inept i award you no stars and my god have mercy on your soul .
i like this place warm and nice crew good and affordable sandwiches and often you can watch football i meant soccer while you drink a brazilian drink and get a good coffee made with oslos beans not expensive genuine great .
service was fine rice was good but the rest stunk meat was dry and shepherd salad had no spice to it felt like plain cucumber and onion baklava was a step above cardboard plain water had a strange taste to it .
friendly little place in brooklyn that serves great drinks the staff is extremely friendly and the cheese bread is good enough to make you forgive the slow service .
disappointing breakfast sandwich for 6 49 eggs were real and appear to be made on site they were not hot though so the slice of cheese didnt melt the croissant was sort of cold burger king does a better job with their croissanwich .
i love this place try the pão de queijo pow dee kayshow or go home caldo verde and generous breakfasts are good too make sure and pour their chilivinegar mixture on everything .
beware if you order a sandwich they charge you 1 for bread and 75 for lettuce and tomato without telling sandwiches are terrible and staff attitude is worst then the dumb expression on their charm less faces .
this place is amazing we had the bruschetta as and appetizer and it was very nice the filet mignon sandwich that i had as an entree was phenomenal the meat was very tender and everything paired wonderfully within the sandwich i highly recommend checking this place out .
awful experience really rude personell and wet saggy sandwiches they were absolutely not interested in service and were more busy speaking spanish to each other positively they gave me a full refund when i didnt want the wet saggy sandwich .
this place is awesome everything is awesome nothing else to say go here it will not disappoint .
this place is awful i tried the arizona panini turkey cheddar cheese and bacon it tastes like crunchy cardboard fail .
lovely friendly waitress maybe a wee bit overwhelmed on a friday night alone delicious up and down we had the cheeseballs and eggplant app and the filet and the shrimp curry for entrees the prices were great also .
below average food really bad pastrami spongy and old stale bread chicken noodle soup with complete lack of and taste dont waste your time look elsewhere .
this is a cute little unpretentious place with consistent tasting food we had the cheese bread eggplant spread steak sandwich and pasta everything tasted good not amazing but pretty good the almond joy desert was great .
ordered a philly cheese steak it was boiled meat presumably beef certainly not steak no flavor stale bread they sold it as deli fresh and that was the misleading event that prompted me to write this review .
i think the most intriguing part of beco is that i felt like i was in brazil it was an abnormally warm spring evening the music was amazing sipped on my caipirinha de caju and devoured my moqueca thank you for the trip .
nothing special at all move along folks overpriced and horrible sandwhich they actually charge you extra for the lettuce tomato and cheese almost a dollar each .
delicious atmosphere and drinks nice music .
its actually difficult to make a bad pizza in the northern nj area avellinos somehow manages to do it the sauce is way too sweet and the overall flavoring really misses the mark there are 23 better pizza places just on beverwyck road itself avoid this place .
great spot to bring a date or friends food was good service excellent and the cashew caipirinhas well youll just have to try it for yourself .
worst pizza thats ever touched my lips .
best meal ive had in williamsburg yet .
customer service here is terrible and as another poster pointed out they are not a salumeria they are more of an italian deli .
unbelievable neighborhood gem dan the owner is tremendous great guy and neighbor try the whiskey and coconut water delicious the food is stellar dont miss this one .
horrible service tasteless food do not eat here .
hands down the best pizza in town grandma pizza is so good their food is always fresh and delivery is fast .
foods generally good but if you order duck you will be in for a rubbery surprise .
pizza is pretty good but the turkey foccacia is incredible .
slow service but the food is very rich and good .
everything is good please get on grubhub asap thanks .
dont eat here we all got extremely sick after going for dinner my whole group got basic items from the menu like guacamole chicken tacos and chicken quesadillas we all spent the night getting sick in various ways it was awful .
love this place highlights include grandma pizza eggplant pesto slice turkey foccacia and chicken foccacia sandwiches service is good mostly very friendly workers it looks like a little bit of a hole in the wall but it looks like they are working on expanding the space .
i have had great mexican food before but this place doesnt measure up in my opinion .
easily one of the best pizzerias i have ever eaten at when i lived in bayonne i ordered from here on almost a daily basis their foccacia sandwiches are to die for .
terrible service and mediocre food deserves 1 star if it wasnt for the outdoor seating i dont think this place could be in business that is all .
truly the best pizza in bayonne although joes is a close 2nd the grandma pie is the shiznit imo the 3 best in bayonne are pizza masters joes and mona lisa for their mona lisa special pie .
horrible food the lamb was cold and greasy tables and chairs were grimy i was sick on my way back dont eat here .
love the pizza and their garlic knots just placed my usual friday evening order and cant wait until it gets here theyve got fast delivery and great prices what more could you ask for .
what you have here is your typical ethiopian restaurant during off hours limited menu and none existing customer service if you do decide to visit this establishment try it during pick hours .
i have been ordering for a few months since a friend turned me on to pizza masters i am happy all the time i especially like the fact that when they say a half an hour for delivery they mean it .
was there once with a friend interesting food everything seemed to have a fair amount of spice even stuff they said was mild yet waiter was helpful as we have never had that sort of food before .
food is great best pizza in town the gravy is just the best but come on its time for an upgrade clean up its 2014 not 1972 .
food is just ok nothing great about this place service sucks if you are not regulars .
you have to try the grandmas pizza amazing also love the chicken shells and broccoli the lunch portion size is huge its like a dinner alone .
refrigerated grilled chicken wrap came with a puzziling side of nacho chips sans salsa meat was as tender as a goodyear never again .
the 5 star rating is for their foccacia sandwich roast beef or portobello dont order the chicken or the turkey youre boring pretty much any thing here made with dough is above par .
offered to help the owner ran as fast as i could .
the pizza is great i am from brooklyn and i come to bayonne for pizza the staff is cool and helpful the grandmas pizza is great also i have not tried the food here but i will when they finally open the restaurant next door ciao .
nice atmosphere awful service hot water cold bread the steak was overpriced for the quality that was served didnt see a refill on fountain drinks until after the meal was finished despite 3 previous attempts to request them wont see us back here .
great takeout italian restaurant awesome fresh pizza and the best grandma pie period extensive menu cheap prices and delicious italian hot sandwiches try the foccia turkey or roast beef tasty and huge portions .
thats 30 im not getting back i went with a group of 5 and we all ordered pasta dishes that were tasteless and unremarkable save your money and go elsewhere .
good pizza get the grandma slice nice job .
ok service was good food overall ok .
my go to place for delivery best overall restaurant in bayonne .
dont go in for espresso they are only interested in making the big bucks off of you i went in twice and they refused me for espresso pagani means pay you must remember you are paying for the realestate .
this place ia great the pizza is excellent .
not good it taste like regular chinese food disappointed because i expected something unique .
closest to new york style pizza in bayonne weve tried several pizza spots in jersey and pizza masters is the closest that comes to new york pizza i love cheesy slices so i usually get the extra cheese their buffalo chicken slices are also delicious .
meh we had high expectations after reading the reviews but the food was like watered down thai food the momos were good but in a standard way nothing out of the ordinary everything else was bland and boring .
i grew up in brooklyn where nearly every pizzeria is great and moved to jersey in the mid 1990s the pizza in hoboken and jersey city is terrible but bayonne pizza is light years better and pizza masters may be the best of them try the grandma slice .
chilli dofu was very good avocado salad was decent i love avocado so that enhanced the dish but i wouldnt come back for this chicken curry dish was inedible since the chicken was so tough the sha thukpa was bland cheap but i wouldnt come back .
the best the sauce yummy pasta dishes r great families favorite 4 over 10 years .
cafe himalaya and i are like charges therefore we repel each other and should stay far far away from each other .
this review is based on ongoing purchases by my family pizza is as good as it gets compared to almost anywhere except nyc stick with the pizza pasta dishes and chicken parmesan and you cant go wrong .
definitely going down hill csg used to be okay but pricey lately especially with their revised menu theyre both overpriced and subpar in quality their specialties greek cuisine the wings come out seemingly rewarmed and somewhat blah the whitefish was dry the vodka rigatoni just fine .
there are so many pizza choices in the area but pizza masters is my top choice i love their margherita pizza their pizzas are extremely tasty and cooked well .
the food is fine but the take out service has been a misery they are very disorganized and very late with the food not worth the trouble .
i can only speak about the pizza and its quite good i love love love the eggplant pizza one day ill try all the other pasta dishes but with the pizza calling my name its hard to try anything else .
awful service left before even being seated there was no one there why did it turn into a 25 minute wait .
excellent better than the jersey city location .
conveniently located in a park and near the train station and the prices are good but their ice cream was soso and my friends freshly squeezed oj was sour .
this place is exactly what you want in koreatown authentic korean reasonable prices minimal wait 15 bucks for classic bibimbop just what we wanted on a frosty january morning .
awesome pizzas however terrible at delivery i dont know if they dont have the staff the kitchen or if they are just disorganized but id recommend avoiding them unless you want to consistently wait 34 hours for a stone cold pizza .
one of the best in korean town service is actually quite good at least among korean town restaurants .
sure its tasty but not incredible definitely not worth the two hour delivery wait it arrived an hour later than scheduled and both pizzas were cold there was barely any basil on the margarita so disappointing going with motorinos next time .
went with a bunch of asian friends who ordered the works for our group of 6 food was excellent better than most of the other places in ktown they also have a really reasonable lunch specialmenu .
food is decent but the service is terrible the waiter was rude and rolled his eyes at us constantly later they said they couldnt split a check and put all of the work on the customer i would never recommend this place to anyone .
great spot for korean food they are fast and delicious get their seafood tofu soup and their number 6 which is their bibimbap which also comes with soup their side dishes are also great .
the pizza was good i got the beastmaster only problem was it wasnt worth 18 50 for a 10 inch thin crust pizza that amounts to about 2 slices of a normal size pizza overpriced .
best seafood tofu ever .
we ordered the torchietti and the pasta was undercooked and very salty we also ordered the paparizza pie and that was salty as well oh and there bathrooms are disgusting .
always generous portion quite fresh and not as pricey as a few comparable restaurants on the same block .
was the pizza good sure was it worth waiting an hour and fortyfive minutes for no the music was too loud and the staff was lukewarm overall not worth the time and effort .
i love this place great dinner or lunch spot soondooboo is afforable and good 247 service is on point kalbi is pretty good as well one love t .
thought overpriced and not that great .
this bcd chain is like the other ones found in southern california they serve good quality soondubu theres nothing that makes the east coast branch any different the interior is really nice two stories and wooden floors and walls you will definitely leave full .
this place has no respect for costumers we were waiting for 3 hours when plenty of tables were available in side employees were taking more than 20 minutes to fill tables while many costumers were waiting for several hours .
very yummy for soft tofu in a tasty bubbling hot broth delivered to your table also recommend the barbecued pork loin plenty of side dishes bonchon a great meal when its cold outside .
they should just rename all their pizzas to stomach cancer every pizza was not charred but straight up burnt i dont understand what all the hype is but then again accepting something as being cool and not knowing why is what being a hipster is all about .
the seafood tofu is amazing the food came in a short period of time esp for a busy resturant the service was very organized but my waitress wasnt very helpful .
food is good but the wait staff and the overall abundance of the place rude and overrated your literally seated on top of other customers and the prices are insanely priced no happy hour btw .
no matter how others will recommend other tofu houses in the ktown i have to say this i just love this place from the appetizers the little yellow fish is awesome rice cake is delicious as always tofu pots seafood or beef .
over a year ago now but it was terrible pizza came burnt the first time and raw the second time not edible either time giving it 2 stars in the hopes that it got better by now .
super yum soondubu stew you will leave satisfied good for groups and sharing food went on a thursday night gets busy but wait is not bad .
hi heres your ironicallynamed pizza with a burnt bubble tumor that is encroaching on more than half the pizza everyone who eats here thinks that this is perfectly acceptable because bushwick thatll be 20 please .
this is a really nice restaurant that makes really great food had the jap chae and it was so flavorful and savory i didnt think that id like tofu but their version was really good and i really liked it id definitely come back here .
for the price and the amount of time you will have to wait to get in let alone get food its really just not worth it this is just another example of a fad restaurant but im afraid the fad is fading i give them a year .
fast nice yummy gurl you get your soondubu at bcd i love spicy food and when i say i want spicy i am asking for spicy bcd can deliver that to you if you want to blow the roof ask to get your tofu extrahot .
overpriced food that isnt worth the wait the lunch deals are a good bargain but without the 2 hour wait you might find the food to be shockingly average .
open 24hrs awesome and dangerous awesome lunch special that comes with 12 apps first a whole fish rice kimchi for 14 i had the seafood soup friends had beef soup yummy beef and mushroom soup fast service great for groups huge seating areas 3 floors .
over 2 hours for a delivery on a sunday night in late february the delivery dude was nice the service on the phone was not repeat over 2 hours for delivery on a sunday night in late february .
good value but suggest going off peak hours otherwise be prepare for long waiting queues .
why cant you choose 0 stars this place is trying so hard full of burnt pizza and a staff of douchebags dont waste your time .
one word soondubu best banchan free small korean side dishes fried fish is the best you get the fish only if you order a soondubu recommend the seafood pancake as well open 247 depending on when you go there could be a wait as bcd is quite popular .
meh slow and overpriced good pizza but not great spicy bloody mary great music would definitely not wait more than 15minutes for a table .
probably the best soondubu in the city never had anything else other than their soondubu so review is purely based on my tofu experience .
do not see what all the hype is about my friends and i waited literally two hours for a table and the food was pretty expensive and not that good .
when i dont know where to go or being too picky to go to any restaurant but still want something relatively fast bcd is the one .
robertas charged me 4 to add kale to the rosso pizza which they burnt market price for kale 78 cents per lb .
very delicious nothing to complain maybe there are too much tofu in the tofu soup .
pizza has been good in the past but they just decided to stop delivering to me after coming here a half dozen times in the past been there many more times for dinner but ill never go back .
just visited empire state building just found this place great value nice place to enjoy a real korean food .
having great product doesnt excuse hiring almost exclusively insolent ungrateful servers unless youre a drug dealer i guess i got amazing amazing service at the local walgreens though no joke service with a smile beaming security guards handonglock if avoidable never setting foot in this restaurant again .
go for the kim chee tofu soup .
i got the margarita for 8 sauce is very sweet and tastes like something generic from a can service pretty terrible very cute inside ill prolly try it again sometime bc its so close to my house but overall its a poor mans frannys .
always go there for mixed soondubu and la galbi also love their clam soup best tofu soup in ktown .
terrible service for groups they forgot my meal and ingot it after everyone finished and we still had to wait to pay our check 2 hour lunch for 10 people the hamegg sandwhich still sucked after waiting and being hungry .
a wide selection of well made standards kalbi is prepared in the kitchen so no cooking odors on the clothes be prepared to wait for a table its very popular .
bartender short hair one is a prick if they dont know you he will treat u like crap barça peyna should have never moved there .
so good even at 5am the seafood tofu soup actually comes with seafood i wouldnt recommend the tebbokki though a little on the sweet side unless thats how its suppose to taste correct me if im wrong .
meh just a standard irish pub for tourists nothing special move along nothing to see here .
best tofu soup place ever like the appetizers especially the fired fish tofu soup is a must order each time .
food was okay but lunch service licks luckily we had time before our train so didnt mind as much but still some of the worst daytime service weve had in nyc .
back when i still lived in los angeles i always drove to bcd with friends their soup and meet combos are all tasty so when the new york one reopened i was extremely happy its definitely one of my fav always have seafood soon dobu .
if you are looking for some south philly italian food this place is not too bad but if you are in the mood for real italian food stay away from this place .
love their vegetable soondubu very appetizing and healthy by the way the grilled fish they served as an appetizer is great too .
terrible undercooked doughy and flavorless if only i could give 0 stars .
i love the tofu stew with beef japchae is served with fried tofu very delicious and quite a large bowl cold raw crab is unique worth a try but is verrrry spicy .
food good veal parm great prices high they charge extra for take out 100s of others dont enough said .
so yummy soooooo yummyyyyy i ordered the shrimp shumai kimchi tofu soup hot and the pancakes service could be better and the hostesses could be friendlier but food is delicious .
only ok got home delivery so maybe that was part of it salad only average greens were cut with hard cores left in pasta was average there are better options including on south street core de roma is better .
you can never go wrong with bcd tofu house consistent quality food and service whether its in the afternoon or 2am love the seafood tofu soup and the little fish side dish .
i wanted to like this place so much after waiting in the rain with this hype i was quite dissappointed food was okay omlette pancakes potatoes were too salty sausage was no different from those hotel breakfast buffets server was a bit rude perhaps nyc has spoiled me .
i definitely love this restaurant they have the most traditional korean food you got to try the tofu soup it is amazing lunch time in business day you can have lunch combo as tofu soup with bbq i ordered the first combo in the menu best ever .
uncomfortably crowded and i find the food to be sort of blah its fine but not my favorite brunch place in new haven by far come to westville for better brunches i say the pancake portions are huge but really do any of us need that .
only tried the kimchi soondubu but was really good .
i really dont understand the hype surrounding this place the wait is usually long service is rushed and the food is overpriced youd get much better food and service at a diner and for half the price .
i hail from la and have been to many of the bcds there this is just another typical korean tofu location the spicy pork dishes are pretty good as well the wait can be a little long on certain days though .
i hate to give it 2 stars but the service was just simply terrible i have to ask 3 different waitress for coffee another 2 for water and waited 20 mins to get a cup of water and coffee food is great the service not so much .
my korean food experience chiefly consists of places in manhattan so perhaps i am missing out on some great places but bcd is my favorite spot on 32nd st for sure of course the tofu soup is what you must get and its great .
waited 30 mins outside the door there are two adjacent 2 seats table which can be combined together instead of doing that they let the 2 people behind us to jump the line and leave two 2 seats table empty unfair and stupid .
the food was great loved my spicy bbq chicken didnt take long to be seated or served open 24 hours .
the pancakes were average great french toast loved the portions of fruit but i was so disappointed by my over cooked eggs on my eggs florentine i also enjoyed the hash browns those were amazing great price and fast service .
get a reservation we went friday night without getting one big mistake the soft tofu with beef was really good the space was casual and noisy but i didnt mind since i was going with a friend .
i have had better pancakes and eggs benedict in the diner ihop and chips i dont know what the hype is all about the pancakes had no taste wont be going here again .
the soy bean tofu soup is excellent they also refill the side dishes they dont take reservation go in around 6pm would have a higher chance of a table .
rude unprofessional and amateur service we gave too many chances thinking it was just a rough start to new opening but the service is still horrible and the taste is inconsistent .
we ordered 4 dishes for 3 people and everything was so good all the side dishes are very good as well we left the restaurant very happy .
restaurant impossible needs to stop here someone needs to tell them that good food doesnt come from a can or box but from scratch nice owners and friendly staff but they dont make up for the horrible food .
i lover korean so i love this place plus the side dishes are good the toufupork bone soup are always the same comparing to similar stores nothing too special but if you are looking for some decent korean food this is a good place to go .
the tacos are ok but the guy who runs it is a colossal jerk .
good food service and decor the korean bbq was great and good late night specials the side dishes were tasty and i really liked the small appetizer fish i was able to enjoy the food and i wasnt rushed like at kunjip i recommend .
italian grandmothers are turning over in their graves in shame due to the almost impossibly bad food served by this make believe italian restaurant makes most airline food shine in comparison .
i love the oyster soon tofu usually go here when the night waiters manager and korean foods are so nice at night u should go when u feel hungry after drinking i love that place .
place is ok .
yummy korean food thats open when you want it to be and fast service the fried dumplings were delicious as was really everything else go and enjoy .
worst experience i ever had there is notthing good in food and service i rather drive little further to go to better places in edison .
the portions are really big and incredibly yummy you can never go wrong with their sundubu or bibimbap the waiters were attentive and all in all everyone had a great time .
just no nothing good can come of this customer service sucks food is lackluster decor is lack luster better can be found in central nj only thing ill eat here chicken cheese kababs and thats about it .
yelp 365 challenge 2014 21365 soothing to any soul after midnight in ny the dishes that brought us back to our roots daeng jang soon tofu kimchi soon tofu bibim nang myun i heart you bcd tofu house .
walked in to an empty restaurant 20 minute wait time server was rude and mentioned tables were reserved ended up leaving save your time .
the service is hit or miss just like my korean speaking skills but the food is delicious and keeps me going back the spicy pork bbq and seafood and beef mixed tofu soup are two of my favorites but you cant really go wrong with anything here .
good is mediocre at best been there three times but wont go again waste of time and money .
best tofu ever .
what a disappointment we had to wait an hour and a half after we got seated for our meal and when it finally came im sure that perubian food taste so much better than that the place is nice but i would never eat there again .
flavor has always been awesome the only drawback is the they only seat your group when everybody is here .
stay away from this place its a very popular spot but service is poor and food is not good how can u miss with benedict eggs on a sunday brunch its doesnt worth the wait .
this is my korean restaurant go to love their stone pot rice and their soft tofu soup so much food that i always have to take leftovers home .
there was nothing special about this place it was more promising from the outside then what it delivered on mediocre boring food average service level at best life is too precious to waste 2 hours here the place need a creative forward thinking menu and chef improved ingredients .
id love to eat here the taste is just right not too salty and sweet but for some reason i find the service and food a lot fuller than at fort lee nj .
weve been waiting an hour for our entree no matter how good the food ends up being i cant recommend this place .
the best soontofu in nyc seriously the best .
horrible horrible service very unclean but food is decent they mixed up our bill and our order the grilled chicken skewer salad was very good while everything else was mediocre bathroom looked worse than one at grand central .
awesome food as always service can get a bit scarce depending on where you sit or how busy they are large space though and good for groups be prepared to wait a long time at dinner time .
overpriced and food was just soso i probably wont go back .
lunch special monday to friday marinated pork with seafood tofu soup combination is awesome .
pouty staff unremarkable food tight tables was very disappointed seems to me like people might come here for the patio tradition and convenience and let the quality of the food slide .
first time been here since they renovated food is still so good .
this was a soso brunch the farmers egg white omelette was fine but not overly impressive the service was quick and pleasant i guess from everything i read about this place i expected better .
met my sister here for dins last week this is one of our go to places when were craving korean food i always get the mandoo soondubu the food is always reliable here and really yummy .
the food quality is about the same as a diner .
the regular spicy beef tofu soup was as great as ever the kalbi in this location was a better quality and taste than ive had it in la the fried gyoza was just ok be prepared to wait on a weekend night .
nothing special here came here for a saturday brunch aka you get cheated out of the complementary drinks worst eggs benedict i have had in a while drenched in hollandaise sauce yes there is such a thing as too much butter .
combo l3 spicy pork and tofu soup .
marginal ravioli good spaghetti n great meatballs breads ok caesar was wellprepared service was slow to lacking wont be back for 110 pretip one could do better party of 3 id rather spend twice as much at a good steakhouse at least the value would be there .
hands down one of the best tofu soups ive ever had you even get a whole fish as a part of the side dishes .
second time here for dinner in six months no complaints at all about the food the service however really hurt the overall experience by nyc standards seemed very understaffed .
pretty good soontofu jigae not too much memory about this place though must go back to try more dishes this is one of those chain restaurants but quality is good for a chain .
we brunched here on a saturday the place was packed but i was underwhelmed linen tablecloths distract from the glorified diner food no complaints about the service but im sure theres a better meal to be found if you venture off the beaten path .
they have a fish in the free appetizers and the environment is better than many korean restaurants on the street .
we dont live in the area and didnt know where to go our friends have a baby so it worked well for them service was ho hum and the food was pretty ordinary wouldnt rush back .
bcd ugh so good favorite dishes include beef soondubu and fried jaeyook dubu it will be very difficult to be disappointed with their food .
overrated i had the calamari as appetizer and they were nothing special then i ordered their evening special seafood linguine they were flavorless considering what they charge it was a full disappointed i have no reason to go back .
good food good service relative to other korean places i had low expectations for service in korean restaurants but this one is actually ok .
awful bad flavorless food .
been a fan of this place since it opened in ktown best place for tofu soup food is great service is good the ambience of the place is great as well thumbs up .
seriously terrible overbooked burgers wet and warm salad that should have clearly been served cold dirty space its really gone downhill .
good place to come before heading home gave soo much food lots of la ribs compared to other beef restaurants .
pass foods really average went for brunch here today ordered the asparagaus benedict and it arrived in 30 seconds the dressing on the side for my friends salad took longer it tasted like it had been prepared beforehand this place is nothing to write home about .
bcd is the spot extra spicy tofu soup and complimentary battered fish is delicious i cant say anymore .
im kind of whatever about this place its not terrible but its definitely not memorable very mediocre definitely not my first choice there are better restaurants in the area ive only been for brunch so who knows maybe lunchdinner is better .
as im thinking back on my experience here i must summarize my experience here as damn this is some good ss korean food soondubu good beef short ribs good homemade kimchi good .
promised us we can stay for 4 hours but forced us to leave when theres still 1 hour .
kimchi soondubu the only thing i order every time when i visit here i am sure other dishes are delicious as well i just cant get away from kimchi .
all i have to say is tango is better better food better karaoke better crowd and more attractive staff its right up the street too .
i love their fresh appetizers especially the fish and the mixed seafood tofu soup the incredible amount of food is really satisfying on a cold winter day ps the lunch special including tips is a mere 13 best quality deal you could find seriously .
sorry but this place is awful not enough food for the price the food was horrible too so many better places to spend my money in the city i even went here with a groupon and it still wasnt worth the price .
went again last night with a friend arrived at 630pm and waited about 30mins i ordered kimchi tofu soup this time and its much better than the mushroom one imo still love the little fried fish .
atmosphere was pretty nice service was ok food was sub par two things that stuck out the most were the beer glasses were not cold and one of the sushis i ordered was still a bit frozen on the bottom spicy toro why .
probably the best kimchi side i have ever had huge portions of jiggae excellent service and other side dishes limited menu but high in quality one of us knew a server there and we were given free soju realllly good and semi sparkling will come back .
food is ok considering the price now their karoke machines what the f is that .
perfect one dish meal for anytime but especially for this kinda weather like the way they serve banchan and fried fish before main dish soondoobu was better than i expected fast serve decent side dishes awesome soondoobu soup and galbi reasonable price .
the only bar where ive developed ptsd the decibels so cranked that when i got outside i thought i just survived an ied if you like sushi out of a can and are a troglodyte youll love it .
everything is awesome not being able to get seated at dinner hour annoying waiting annoying eating tofu good times well worth the wait seafood pancake better then most good eats happy pooping .
love the place and the staff just being a frequent customer the prices keep going up and up .
one of the best korean restaurant i have ever tried very tasty tofu soup .
way too crowded way too expensive not worth the wait .
wow the servers were really on top of their game they were there in 2 seconds when i broke a raw egg on the table instead of in my soondubu because i thought it was a hard boiled egg it was really delicious egg fiasco aside .
fairly nice but way overpriced .
amazing place for tofu soup a definite place to visit if you come to nyc my girlfriend and i love this place .
not worth the money the spider roll which included 4 pieces was 10 making each piece 2 50 ridiculous .
tofu soup always thumbs up bim bim bon whatever thumbs down .
ehhh not horrible but who brings one of your appetizer after on of your mains the poutine here would make a french canadian cry a couple curds and a tablespoon of gravy .
this place is bangin start the meal w nice banchan a small fried fish very flavorful mushroom soon dubu even though there was no egg great soft tofu cant wait to come back .
i live across the street completely disrespectful neighborhood business on weekend nights loud music no crowd controlling from the establishment till 23am sometimes .
im a huge fan of soondubu bcd was clean spacious we got seated after a short wait for dinner on a saturday night i ordered the beefseafood soondubu and it was perfect for the chilly day service was good too .
ordered delivery from this place tiny portions very salty and very pricey but the portions man i mean tiny maybe i wouldve had a better experience had i actually gone there .
considering that i am not really a tofu person this is the highest ranking i can ever give really love the way they serve rice especially with tea remember to throw the raw egg in real quick otherwise it can never be fully cooked .
get an answering machine that says when youre closed instead of making people drive in horrible weather .
soondodu is just ok cant compare with another korean restaurant ive been to but the kal bi is so great you must try it .
steven r if you like the chili go to father son in linden sal gets his chili there the dogs at father son are bigger and prepared on a griddle .
you just cant go wrong here the soondubu is incredible i dream about this place .
this place is quite overrated bad service and had very rude staff pretentious x10 stay away go to barbuto instead .
the best soondubu in us and their stonepot rice that comes with the meal is out of this world highly recommended .
the foie gras ravioli was good the spaghetti was not nearly as good as the first time i had it the goat was very tough and dry the short rib has good flavor but too salty dont think i would recommend this restaurant anymore .
stumbled upon this place one night while walking east from penn station as a vegetarian they had me at tofu house the curry is delicious and the complimentary fried fish is a nice touch .
average food is not great .
soondobu galbi combo delicious and way too much food share this with someone i unf did not have the foresight and felt guilty the rest of the day nice decor and open space im a fan and ill be back soon very soon very very soon .
the waiters wear obnoxious apron man skirts .
soft tofu quick service i mean quick you get the appetizers right after you order and within five minutes you get your entree the kimchi tofu soup with beef really hit the spot great service .
hostess was so mean my parents were visiting from tokyo and we had a reso but we were so put off by the attitude of the hostess that we decided not to bother going in .
my favorite soondubu jip this was my first time at the new location and its a lot bigger than the old space two stories for one thing i usually get the assorted soondubu beef shrimp clam and its so freakin good their service is really efficient as well .
was here last night and had very bad food poisoning i would not recommend going here avoid this place at all costs very overrated .
love their tofu hot pot and bbq ribs .
really disappointing this is not what i expected of the best spaghetti it tasted like an acidic chef boyardee just with thicker noodles that reminded me of chinese food .
really great lunch deal the side dishes get refilled very quickly here dont even need to ask the tofu is the highlight and it does not disappoint new location two floors very nice staff .
not very good food everything i ordered was tasteless the delivery was on time but that was the only good thing wont be eating here again .
best tofu soup my favorite is seafoodbeef combination service is also very friendly cant wait to go back .
two stars because the food was decent almost shocking how terrible the service was will not be coming here again what a disappointment .
great korean food lots of plate .
the duck was dry and tasted like fried salty cardboard their eggplant and panfried noodles were okay the overall experience needs work and has a lot of potential .
delicious service was so helpful hard to understand but they tried so hard recommendations were splendid food was to die for .
it has been an hour and a half since i ordered and no food when i called i was told it wasnt their fault because they were busy unacceptable .
deliciousness wrapped up in spice .
awful delivery service nasty arrogant rude maybe the foods okay but these people dont have their act together when it comes to delivery service .
pretty good hot is perfectly spicy the kim chi is ok the wait was not too bad and the atmosphere pretty chillcool do not bring a date it can be a little loud .
worst egg and cheese bagel ever egg was so spongy it tasted really fake place looks really nice though has nice coffee station .
o m g this place has gotten much better than it used to be the decor is pretty trendy it has plenty of seating and the food just seems better quality now the kalbi especially was very flavorful and tender this may be my new favorite ktown spot .
sorry but the place smells of moldy carpet the food was just passable the tom gai ka soup was good but the pad thai had too much sauce and the shrimp were not fresh i have a bit of a stomach ache and i just left .
mandoo soondubu beef soondubu reminisced of la days same frenzied kitchen noise servers carrying hot pots of bubbling spicy soup same flavors with a ny premium .
i just ordered some food for delivery from here campusfood com good service gave me a free coke with my order however the food was just okay rice pot or bangkok garden are better .
tofu soups are real good but if you are in the mood for korean bbq then definitly get the galbi its the best in ktown also a bit cheaper compare to the other places .
i love thai food i hated this it was just greasy fried sugary and just well gummy none of which i associate with thai food .
one of my favorite korean restaurant in k town tofu pot and ribs are so good we tried pancake tonight and it was awesome as well give a shot .
greasy lunch buffet havent been back .
they are back and just as good a little more spacious and less crowded with an elevated back area and a second floor the food is just as good .
wonderful flavors but so salty too bad we might come back i did let a staff member know about the excess of salt hopefully they address it .
finally reopened after 4 month i am a bit disappointed about the fish they serve before the meal it was left in the deep fryer for way too long i wasnt even eatable hopefully itll be better next time .
poor service the hostess was not helpful at all food was decent but portions are a bit to small even for tapas the crowd is a little weird good wines tho .
good price tasty tofu good beef .
some of my favorite restaurants in both ny and la are mario batalis this is not one of them the service was rather cold octopus over fennel and grapefruit razor clams skirt steak rabbit with kimchi razor clams was by far the best dish and the little olives .
this place located in the food court has bar none the best salads downtown excepting settimo spring mix nuts grilled shrimp or chicken the usual deal pizza is also delicious and they usually have special antipasto salads and entrees .
we came here for restaurant week lunch and the service was painfully slow the food was good but the portions were teeny tiny the dining room was very cramped making us even more anxious with the slow service .
tried them for the first time at love park very good hot dog i had the san jose which is a bacon wrapped dog with bbq sauce onions and cheddar cheese very crunchy and delicious ill be back .
small plates small food small restaurant big hopes big disappointment big check .
awesome hotdogs i loved the chicago an all beef hotdog served with mustard relish peppers tomatoes etc plus the dapper dog himself is a member of the tribe sababa .
disappointing batali restaurant didnt particularly love anything everything was just okay for the price dinnerdrinks for two cost 160 not a good value service was also bad rushed unfriendly and not helpful .
a big messy delicious hot yummy crazy hot dog truck just what the dogdoctor ordered for a cold winters day dapper dog ill follow you to the ends of the block .
the combination of the hostesss bad attitude back to hostessing school you go with the unbelievably long wait really put me off of this place for good the food and wine was solid but one can say that about a number of manhattan tapas joints no .
i have yet to have anything that was not fantastic the mexican a bacon wrapped hotdog enough said with sour cream pico and jalepeños amazing .
i prefer the calamari most pork belly was too dry and over cooked .
great selection and theyre here for you after you stumble out onto 2nd street drunk as a skunk i may not have ever eaten at the dapper dog sober but who cares theyre great the guys that run the cart are pretty cute too .
maybe the food and wine is good but it was so pretentious i couldnt stand to stay and find out .
after a long night out the dapper dog is quite possibly the greatest thing since sliced bread cant remember what i had last time i was here but thats not a reflection of the food but rather a testament to my night out .
good food tappas style restaurant too expensive for my budge eat befor you go .
i love me some dapper dog goodness the menu selections are great and i cant wait to order a whatever i want on a roll sandwich for 5 .
looks really nice trough the windows and when you first walk in then you realize the tables are incredibly uncomfortable then you realize you ordered an unfiltered wine that is supposed to be that way finally you realize the food is way too rich and overdone .
fantastic fresh spices great flavors masterfully prepared and not too spicy well definitely be back .
space is too cramped service was inattentive and the food is entirely average the rice bomba was so fishy and the monkfish was dry and overcooked i liked the butternut squash croquettes and the really loved the duck egg but everything else was either bad or average .
it is actually pretty good not sure why it is always empty but they have a great selection of dosas nice service and reasonable prices we go there often as it is close to home nice experience overall .
original review 5 stars kool spot best to go off peak not traditional tapas theres a wine bar next door if you have to wait new review dont bite the hand that feeds you stupid mario uno star .
excellent variety full of flavor went there as a family ordered different dosas andhra spicy kothamalli nellore kara were stand outs sambhar was perfect heaven for vegetarians very good service too will go there again .
would of i come here if it was not a batali restaurant no dont get me wrong everything was ok it was good nothing was great and everything was overpriced the experience was good but i do not think i will be going back .
fabulous south indian buffet clean cutlery and fresh food comes with freshly made rotis and dosas wish we had this in my city 6222012 .
the service sucks the food is mediocre the decor is drab the open kitchen is dingy youre in new york you can do much better .
what a gem of a restaurant food is always good and fresh one of the best sambhars i have had in nj there is a large variety of dosas and chutneys service is very friendly this place is unpretentious and homely .
greasy fried onion famous sauce is ok burnt ends are mediocre i had two bites of the ribs one bite of the baby back and one of the st louis thats it i immediately asked for the bill the ribs were tough and drowned in an unappetizing sauce .
excellent lunch buffet for veg period nice dosas at reasonable price keep up the good work folks .
got the combo platter and it was awful very pricey as well ive also eaten at the moutainside location and was equally as underwhelmed this place gives northeast bbq a bad name .
great sambar and a wide selection of dosas we even happened to try out the weekend lunch buffet which was deeeelicious .
not great bbq but fairly priced .
i only ordered a single uttapam but i thought it was flavorful and tasty three chutneys and a nice veggielentil dipping sauce were great compliments also i wouldnt say there are a ton of vegetarian restaurants in east windsor so that should be taken into account .
one star because i couldnt do zero if you havent eaten before you get here wait until you get to where you are going this is airport food at its worst .
unreal happy hour cheap drafts half price apps just watch out for the cops the west hartford cops are real dcks around here because they feel this happy hour somehow sullies the west hartford center vibe of pretentiousness cool place check it out .
absolute garbage rude slow service and a well done burger ordered medium rare was also ice cold steer clear .
this has been the most amazing experiences the food atmosphere decor were beyond outstanding .
terrible burnt coffee rock hard inedible english muffin soggy toast and cold scrambled eggs shame on them for serving this food to people who dont have many other options in the airport .
the atmosphere is opulent the food delicious and the drinks superb the lounge have real fruit juice in them my daughter is vegan and they had some very good choices for her not just salad you wont be disappointed .
go there only if your flight is more than an hour later since the service is tooo slow or shall i say they are understaffed had a garden salad which i really liked but the lemonade supposedly made from real fruit juice was a total disappointment .
seated within 15 minutes on a saturday night right as the bartender gave us our drinks crab cakes threeway salmon and grand hells kitchen lounge the chicken was one of the best ive ever had mashed potatoes were perfect .
good service however cheeseburger was so so i had starving a for burger and im disappointed with this place anyway their waitresses were highly attentive .
me and the gf went there nice spot had the wings for happy they were very tasty will have to go back and try more of the food .
horribly slow service at an airport when youre usually pressed for time stood at the front being ignored by the hostess for 5 min if i had a better option i would have gone elsewhere .
the wings here are amazing the fries are crack too excellent bar food the drinks are delicious too it has become my go to spot the music can be really loud on fridays because of the dj but regardless it is a great vibe i love it here .
very average overpriced no sides 17 for some chicken on a plate this place could be so much better next time ill go to dickeys bbq down the street .
ive been going for years and its always a good time good food good drinks awesome staff .
no fries or sides for a basic pulled pork sandwich 13 on a store bought potato roll good drinks basic bbq for way to much money step it up a bit guys maybe throw your customers a piece of cornbread weak will not return .
i love coming here they have the best nachos drinks are great and really every dish i order is good i miss their veggie burger .
food was like a mac but price like a 5star restaurant i will never go back .
good food good drinks and awesome bartenders always a good time to be had especially if you get a chance to check out their free thursday night burlesque show .
cool atmosphere food was very average i had the bbq chicken with cole slaw both were pretty flavorless for a bbq place .
roof top deck is sooo dope two for one drinks during happy hour loads of hot ladies this is the place to be .
the food is foul if you want real bbq go to the khyber pass pub in old city please .
great draft beer selection and even better atmosphere one of the better bars in newark to go to .
meh it was ok lousy chicken bbq nice decor worth stealing decent service if you like the dallas cowboys because the bartender is .
love the outdoor seating and the ambiance inside service is good great live bands and fun theme nights drinks are great but food is just okay its slowly become a regular goto spot definitely stop in for a drink if youre in the area .
i was less than impressed with this place the food was just ok very smoky flavor that was overwhelming and ruined chicken i would not recommend this place .
its by far the best bar in the ironbound the music is good specially on thrusdays the food is really good and well priced and the crowed it great its a great local bar and by far my favorite place .
the ribs were stiff and certainly didnt fall off the bone the sauces are good but really over rated and dont recommend for good bbq .
great wings all the time and friendly staff .
new york prices with out the flare or quality find somewhere else to spend your money .
went yesterday for nfl kickoff and caught their thur night burlesque show titties beer and football did i just hit the trifecta had a great time will be back again .
good food really really rude bartender dont come if you dont feel like being treated like an annoyance .
great spot will definitely come back .
food is great but no table service the bartender is extremely rude and treated myself and our table like dirt i would not come here again despite the food being very good .
a great place to grab a beer or 5 before a devils game the food is good but nothing spectacular staff is always nice and attentive however i doubt i would ever come here just to hang out if i wasnt going to a game .
sandwiches were terrible dry and tasteless the server was extremely rude .
this time went on a friday night to watch the devils in the playoffs everyone had a good time and even with the crowd our food and drinks came quickly and were delicious as always love this place .
the burgers were creative in a gimmicky way the servers were all too busy being pretentious hipsters to help their customers overrated and overpriced .
great place to grab beers and some good bar food only down side is the out of towers pack the place on devils games but its good for the city and the bar owners so a winwin worth checking out very out of the norm .
terrible service rude staff wont be coming back the adult milkshake was decent but the wait was not worth it in short i wont be returning .
posters of midcentury pinup girls on bright red walls very nice huge variety of things going on here from one night to the next really exciting place cheap drinks pricey food really fun atmosphere though .
went on a saturday night atmosphere was oddly hood they were playing the movie requiem for a dream on the tvs bad vibes all around .
ran out of beer during super bowl sunday due to a busy weekend and small storage area waitress always checking on us and was extremely friendly which was good the music selection playing was great didnt try the food but expresso was good .
went to this place to see what the fuss was about there was a roach on my food and the waiter was rude and made it difficult to return the dish waiter posted my receipt on the internet i wish i could give 0 stars but not possible .
great superbowl experience only reason for the for stars is that it was a bit pricey for bar food but id go back again to chill and watch a game .
this is the first time i was charged a 2 to go fee and to add to that the food and the service isnt even good .
a great out of the ordinary bar the mixed drinks are awesome and i enjoy going but it does get pricey .
crappy service poor unprofessional management mediocre food .
i like going to this place and hangout for a few drinks before club scene friendly staff and never scene any problems there with other patrons .
this place is terrible management and staff are direspectful of their customers plus it isnt hard to make burgers taste halfway good with all that fat and salt l .
interesting decor solid bar food great service and cheap beer 10 pitchers of longhammer ipa id certainly come back .
normally i dont write negative reviews but this place was absurdly below par burger and fries were cold and employees comments were just deal with it because of night would rather eat from a street vendor or even homeless man quality was awful .
drinks good food good prices good atmosphere good often very loud service good all this added together repeat customers .
got the pyt burger very average nothing to write home about the place was dead but the music was blaring for some reason lots of good restaurants in the area i would avoid pyt .
the devils got your tongue wings will make you cry this is coming from someone who will randomly shoe jalepenos in her mouth and gnaw on them with delight dont do it im telling you .
worse burger place in philly poor presentation average food and lousy service better if they stick to the classics .
one of my favorite bars in newark great atmosphere friendly crowd awesome drinks and good food highly recommend to anyone .
lived in the piazza for 3 years ate here 4 or 5 times average food average drink hit or miss service i would suggest walking the extra 8 blocks and going to sketch .
good wings great burgers cheap beer fun crowd great location near the pru and onstreet parking sometimes available for games its a winner winner chicken dinner .
what a waste of time while in philly food was cold by time we were served and the service was worse i would high recommend not to bother .
best devils pregame bar hands down cheap beer guinness is under 3 bucks great food and a great atmosphere .
place sucks charged me for crap i didnt even order even had the audacity to tell me i did eat it 5 mins later told me youre right after realizing whos at fault never will i return wish i had left a 20 cent tip .
3 pbr 16oz cans 9 for a good burger and fries buy backs friendly waitstaff and a unique atmosphere this place is great make sure to stop before a devils game .
the thing that bothered my girlfriend and i the most was the ignorant servers if your not part of their in crowed then your treated like crap when you disrespect someone you never know when it may come back to bite you in the pyt .
this place was great staff was nice and there were some cuties when i went wasnt crazy price wise lounge like area dont sit by the speakers haha they werent on when we got there but later metal was melting my brain .
average food at best just cheese and goo .
inklicous burlesque wonderful kitchy grundgy server rosie was friendlier than a sailors tattoo on shore leave huh anywaywilliamsburg meets newark .
man this service was pretty awful i wet there yesterday after getting off my shift and damn my water wasnt filled up once food is medoicre at best id pass on this one .
this place just opened last saturday and ive already been there twice their slogan is damn fine food wicked drinks and a hell of a good time and that just about sums it up .
ate there yesterday and the burgers are honestly not that good if you are looking to have a 5000 calorie meal i would recommend going to fogo or chimas service was also very poor .
a decent asian restaurant in south philly food is good and i must say the service is great for one lady who takes all the orders bring them out if youre looking for a quick grub thats not expensive this is the spot .
came here a few weeks back awful service very slow and it wasnt even that packed to warrant it .
sweet sweet mouth victory i want to eat this food every day for the rest of my life curry chicken and chargrilled pork noodles make my heart sing .
food is decent but service was terrible place is for hipsters who dont have standards will never go back .
the place to go for the best cambodian noodle soup only other thing i had was the spring rolls which were mediocre .
always have been overpriced and arrogant ive tried them 3 times now and im done trying also 40 minimum on cards at the bar is insane .
good cambodian food and good phnom phenh noodle soup it small place but good for quick meal my family like it please keep it clean the owner .
overpriced poor service long waits was popular in 2011 but the idea has run its course and now all thats left is 15 dollar burgers and mediocre service butterfinger milkshake is ok .
cheap and delicious cambodian noodle soup we use to go to nam vang in northeast but this place hands down is so much more fresh and delicious perfect after a night of drinking hits the spot .
terrible service and the food isnt worth coming in for you can find better food at other burger joints they dont serve anything special that you cant get at another location .
good and affordable lunch went here every time when i am in philly .
just about the worst burger ive ever had i wouldnt recommend this for a dog let alone for human consumption honestly white castle frozen burgers are a better choice rude service rob and indifferent management how else can i say avoid at all costs .
hidden gem in south philly food is delicious may be hard to find parking on weekends .
i thought i was the only one who got shitty service i guess its what theyre good at i just wish they were good at making decent food .
how long has this place been around and now did i not know about it until now ka tieu phnom penh omg so good and cheap .
the only thing that is consistent with the pyt experience is the service while ive given this famed establishment several chances i just cant get over the waits and the disinterested staff the special burgers are pretty good but cant justify the inevitable frustration with the overall experience .
gotta try the cambodian pho quaint little corner spot .
another northern libs restaurant with decent food but apathetic hipster servers there is nothing wrong with showing you care about your job if you cant remember an order for a party of 2 then maybe you should write it down .
7th street the place to be love the service and the food close to my moms cooking this is the next best thing d .
finally got my punchcard and got the 2nd class citizen treatment im too old for this conclusion pyt chuck e cheese for millennials .
everything was homemade and had a unique flair to it check out the pictures and order desert .
hmmm the menu seemed very cool but thats just it it wasnt amazing but it wasnt terrible either id rather eat at shack shake .
ive been are several times for lunch and have been pleased each time the gorgonzola burger chicken sandwich and tuna sandwich were all very good the atmosphere is great i look forward to trying it for dinner soon .
pretty good if youre from the suburbs otherwise feel free to patronize any of the good restaurants in philly .
highly recommended especially the lavender almond brie appetizer byob and delicious homemade food staff was very friendly loved it here and will be back soon .
poor service horrible management will never come here again .
a new big fan two apps four mains two desserts tea 125 incl tax all excellent good service decent space homey atmosphere nice neighborhood spot will be back only caveat street parking difficult suggest parking a few blocks west towards the perelman museum and walking .
for the prices i recommend reinvesting in a heater in the winter on a 30 degree night ambient temp was about 60 too cold .
the table ordered brie in the clay pot special salad with pineapplevery good lamb 3 shrimp with angel hair filet 2 sole stuffed with crab meat everything was delicious the waiter was very helpful and attentive a place my family loves to go back to every few months .
not sure what the hype was all about gonna save a few words but definitely had better i had the pretzel burger barely any cheese or onion it was all pretzel maybe ill return for a special off the menu burger only .
my absolute favorite brunch spot order the breakfast blt or moroccan eggs everything is good but those are my favorites and the mint tea yum .
horrible service and sent back food for the first time in my culinary lifetime went to this place on new years day last year and it was excellent went this year on new years day and it was awful terrible bloodies and stale waffles .
in short best byob in fairmount i had a special the 3rd time in stuffed salmon with vanilla risotto and a sour glaze cooked perfectly i didnt want it to end so i ate it very very slowly drove my family crazy .
worst crap hole ever how many managers do you have that cant address any issues 12 14 disgrace to the neighborhood .
a friend and i went to figs for dinner it was cute the service was good and the food was yummy the salmon was cooked perfectly the bean spread that they bring with the bread is really good i wish i knew what it was .
the service was ok the food was good te milkshake made me sick they double charged my card and were extremely unprofessional and insincere about their mistake i wont go back and wouldnt recommend it to anyone else .
they have a really great brunch .
horrible manager they refused to do takeout even to vendors at the brooklyn flea outside their front door who couldnt leave their booths staff members said that she didnt care about losing business bizarre stay away .
figs is amazing ive been a number of times and have had enjoyed each visit .
cliche .
had dinner here last night beautiful food there were 4 of us and the meat eaters found it very difficult to decide love their capri salad service was good there was await for our table which is understandable definitely try to come back here .
worst ever .
another amazing trip to figs last night this has to be my favorite restaurant in philly the food is incredible dont hesitate just go .
dirty dirty dirtypants this place gets more disgusting every time i come here bad food and even worse service .
a great small cozy corner brunch spot the service is excellent and the food is plentiful with decent pricing the moroccan tea is one of my personal favorites .
was great when it first opened then a bunch of hipsters overtook it horrible service clingly weightstaff that continually talks to you while you eat if you want a good burger save some money and go to shake shack in center city .
figs is a byob in fairmount the food is spectacular which is why it is always packed the owner and staff are friendly great atmosphere a fun place to dine .
you cant tell who the servers are here at first i kept wondering why the guy who looked like he tried too hard to look hipster kept glancing over at our table then i realized he was a server the food was good but overpriced .
perfect everytime excellent food great staff best byo in the neighborhood cash only maybe that would be my only knock since i never have cash also call for reservations .
my burger came out w hair on it and they dont have enough vegan options on the menu for no libs thats surprising they should make a soy milk shake too and also like actually send clean food out .
consistently good lunches and weird dinners not sure why maybe a different chef i work nearby and continue to go for good lunches the dollar value is good but remember to bring cash .
crappy service .
super delish omelette everyone else got the moroccan eggs which were a huge hit i cant wait to come back and have the challah sp raisin french toast mmmmmmmmmmmmm awesome place definitely going back for brunch and dinner .
the piazza is phillys ass and pyt is the pimple on it .
i love figs the atmosphere is so warm and cozy and the service was great we got the scallop appetizer which had four scallops i have gotten less than that elsewhere for an entree great meal and would certainly go back .
good place to go and get shot no really pyt draws the thugs from the hood after a few milkshakes spiked with jim beam the egos come out and so do the guns last night the inevitable occurred and someone wound up dead nice bar .
if i do not want to make my own meatballs i go here i love their meatballs whether they are on a sandwich or on top of pasta nothing but great food and service here every time i visit or call for a delivery .
the service was needlessly slow and generally inattentive the food took too long and didnt live up to the menus promise it wasnt terrible by any stretch of the imagination it just wasnt the greatest burger or service for my buck .
i went here last week and the meatball subs are so good i got the meatball mozzarella and red sauce probably one of the best subs ive had in awhile definitely will be going back .
bougie hellhole i asked my server what was on tap he didnt know because he doesnt drink beer are you kidding me .
excellent lunch spot this is a go to for me .
decent food decent beer terrible service annoying atmosphere trying way too hard to be trendy will not be back .
hands down best meatball hero ive ever had i knocked down a pork philly with beefporkveal meatballs aged provolone and broccoli rage i will definitely be back .
terrible food worse service the place looks like an adult chuck e cheese but instead of guys walking around in mouse suits and video games there are strung out employees and semen covered bean bags .
i hadnt been in awhile the meatballs and pasta are still excellent best in the city and reasonably priced for the quality and size .
eh liked the song much better the adult milkshake was definitely the highlight of my meal there i do like their outdoor space though would be a good spot for drinks but i would skip the food .
the best homemade commercialized meatball sandwich around the traditional pork veal beef meatball is outstanding these people know what theyre doing and for the gravy impressive the mozz is fresh and if that wasnt enough its served on a fresh toasted roll my family will be back .
automatically adding gratuity to a bill regardless of party size this place automatically looses all credibility in my eyes .
the meatballs are good try the meatball caesar salad with chicken .
the burgers are decent but the service is questionnable at best the fact that they will automatically add a 20 gratuity to your bill is absolutely ridiculous i wont be going back anytime soon what a joke .
will be back not a meatball lovee but could learn to enjoy with their variety of choices went for lunch during work and can say i only ate half and will enjoy the rest this evening .
go if youre ready to be underwhelmed and do not order the sloppy jill burger unless youre willing to pay 12 on the menu says 10 but i was billed 12 for a disapointment of a burger boo .
the chicken parm sandwich is fantastic it is consistently well done the service is fast the tables turn over fast its a neighborhood gem .
was very excited to try the krispy kreme and bacon burger it was ok not bad no specific complaints but i wont be going back also it was quite noisy and the atmosphere was generally uncomfortable .
lots of stuff to choose from their menu i would definitely come back and try other stuff .
warning warning if you are a vegan stay away from pyt theyve discontinued their vegan burger even though its still on their menu and they use only martins potato rolls anyway which are not vegan i sat waiting for 20 minutes before learning pyt had nothing to offer .
got the veggie rabe so fantastic the veggie meatballs are very flavorful the broccoli rabe tasted as if it were made by my mom cant wait to go back .
my duck lorange burger was definitely lame tasted like a turkey burger an overcooked one but shit i sure did look cool eating it .
i love the veggie meatballs because they dont even try to make them as meat analogs they are clearly vegetable spinach is perfect sauces have fabulous flavor good bread and the staff are friendly i will be going back .
youve gotta be better than this in philly service was horrible and so was the burger had the pty burger there are too many good choices out there to go to pyt it was much more about the setting than the food unnecessary .
all i can say is yum i make meatballs quite frequently and a friend of mine said i should try marabella i honestly think i will be using their meatballs for sunday dinner from now on great sandwiches and super sweet cashier .
i want to love this place i really do but the food has been disappointing time and time again why oh why im gonna give this place another shot bc the idea of pyt is just so awesome and i cannot give up on them .
simple classic meatball sandwiches weve been several time for lunch and even met a friend for a quick dinner once the place is small but i guess they do more take out than eating in its clean and youll love the sandwich .
for a burger joint trying to be hip youd think theyd be capable of putting something vegan on the menu .
still pretty great two years later thanks .
ok the one star is for my yummy adult milkshake with rainbow jimmies i wanted to like pyt but i just cant i will never go back there again the noise and clientele ruined it for me .
nonni sandwich with veggie meatballs aged provolone marinara and broccoli rabe thats how you satisfy a vegetarian .
lets face it the only thing this place has going for it is the milk shake but from what im reading below even that is sometimes a struggle despise being dragged here saturday after saturday .
these meatballs are the bees knees simple review for a simple yet perfectly made light fluffy meatball .
bad service bad food bad beer selection bad liqour selection tried it a couple times never again dont waste your time .
ordered the special meatball of the day beef pork and veal meatballs with whole wheat penne pasta and tomato sauce topped with cheese parsley and garlic it was yumo definitely going back soon .
all hype the burger is good but nothing special .
best authentic mexican food in ct great price .
was it the worst chinese food i have ever eaten probably expensive very fatty yuck and the wait staff is not helpful i suggest mcdonalds as an alternative .
just went for a quick dinner the steak fajita was really good and not too heavy the waitress was nice good prices too but ill have to keep the 5th star because the decor really needs some fixes here and there nice .
its very bad the kun paul chicken like a wood .
good noodle decent taste .
every dish tastes like soy sauce .
the dim sum here is right up there with nyc chinatown .
if youre looking for a true gyro this is not the place to go seem nice but very slow heading to reading terminal to get my gyro fix .
great dim sum the only problem is that its not available during the week im retired so i can do something like this everything is fresh and they have a nice choioce of dishes .
the food was ok but the service was so disappointing it ruined the entire experience also the water was lukewarm and provided in tiny glasses that were never refilled get it together pjs .
this is a pretty good dim sum restaurant although the service is not great the taste is excellent and the price is pretty reasonable .
pancakes are very ordinary bacons are not even smoked hash browns are just bunch of mashed potatoes i dont understand why there seems to be a line outside on weekend probably because of lack in brunch places in princeton .
great dim sum we need to get there earlier so we can try more dishes we arrived in the last hour of dim sum service and it seemed like they werent offering that many dishes .
wont be going back .
been going to dim sum across the street for some time now and went here this weekend so much better friendly dim sum ladies and the food was fresh and yummy will return .
overepriced 3 50 for a glass of og 10 for a bowl of berry fruit salad mediocre service long wait noisy and crowded restaurant and an all around awful experience .
its the best dim sum i had in nj actually china town quality is going down so i would put this place right up there in terms of decor you can fuh getta about no other reason to go than to eat good food i will be back .
good coffee and the lox and bagel sandwich was fine the smashed potato side was pretty awful though the omelets looked good as did the pancakes i saw .
we loved this place so much we had our wedding here must try the taipain mei fun it is loaded with mixed seafood pork and pickled vegetable we get it every time we come here we even had it on our menu on our wedding day .
as a frequent customer i would say their menu has changed as well as their prices the quality of their food is not satisfactory owners have changed and obviously pjs will never be the same coming from a princeton resident .
good place for dim sum and dinner owner is friendly too though sanitation and staff friendliness can be off at times still a great place to eat the salt and pepper shrimp sweet and sour porkchop fried flounder and fried shrimp tofu are personal favorites .
people line up outside when we pass by so we decided to give it a try its pricey for breakfast the portions are small there was hardly any space and the pancakes were average youre better off if you go somewhere else .
service is not so great but their food dim sum and regular lunchdinner dishes is great definitely authentic and can satisfying discerning chinese customers .
undercooked pancakes still wet oversalted potatoes and oily eggs absolutely horrible and overrated place how can you screw up pancakes when you call yourself a pancake house .
dim sum has good variety and taste good service could be a bit friendlier the food from the menu is also very good will keep coming back .
overpriced and not that great dont know why there is always a long line go to bagel street grill instead .
our family and friend always dine here on the weekends their food is consistance and the quality is good friendly staffs .
this place is gross oily eggs no real maple source charge 10 for mediocre pancakes quantity but no quality coffee tastes like mud water .
i love this place this is the style of chinese cooking that really hits the spot they can specialize the orders for you and have dishes that are truly old style chinese make sure you ask about the frequent dining card for discounts .
a reasonable neighborhood brunch place .
the service is subpar sometimes and is difficult especially when you dont speak mandarincantonese but the food is authentic and pretty good its worth a shot .
just about every time i go they have me in the drive up pulling to the side to wait for something to finish cooking its annoying theres never enough chicken pieces or pies ready always something always .
a good place to get your authentic dim sum fix also good for nondim sum times the food is authentic and consistently good .
this restaurant has become the classic case of new owner keeping the name and prices but food quality does not even come close to previous expectations steer clear of this place until the prices come down at least .
who doesnt love dim sum this is great traditional dim sum theyve got the traditional carts the good cantonese dishes we all love be sure to get the xiao long bao super good the prices were good and the food was fantastic love it .
arrived early for our reservation on a sunday evening but the hostess was too busy to notice ten minutes later we were greeted and shown to our table the food was soso the service was mediocre valet parking was ridiculous .
good dimsum when youre feeling it .
food is good however a waiter told us that they wanted to reset the table when we were 50 finished with coffee and cappuccino nice way if saying please leave so we can turnover the table lame pork chop overdone and too salty apps were incredible .
french onion soup omg cheeeese best ive had really cute cozy atmosphere nice staff and ill definitely be back .
walked in around 3in the afternoon to my surprise the vietnamese lady was changing a childs dirty diaper behind the counter the child was in a car seat type chair i couldnt believe it needless to say i did a 180 and left .
stumbled in at lunch by random choice what a find great service awesome bistro atmosphere loved the lardon frissee salad loved the steak frite poutin loved the chicken paillard truly great lunch its my new go to if near soho .
nothing to see here dive bar garden variety margaritas greasy food the photos speak for themselves seems this has been done before stay clear of the spicy beer cocktail yuk .
i went with a group of 4 for brunch and we all loved our food the service was really good as well the restaurant was cute and clean no complaints .
based on delivery from seamless web ordered huevos rancheros brunch special was a little oily and not really fresh tasting might give it a chance if passing by but wouldnt order from them again .
cute french bistro with an original vibe and actually with real french food they have croque mensiour on the menu but if you ask you can have a croque madam as well it is actually one of the best croque madam i ever had even better than paris .
this place has a cute ambiance and good food but the prices are a little higher than they ought to be and the last time i was there my waiter was incredibly annoying to the point that i almost walked out .
i had never been before and decided to stop in for lunch very friendly service and delicious food also good ambiance with the music if youre into that .
cant really comment on the food i waited 10 minutes at the door to be seated without any acknowledgement from the staff i left your service is typical new york dont give a shit service fantastic .
lambshank is top notch at this restaurant service staff is friendly so is the owner if youre looking for simple solid french fare definitely recommended .
horrible service i was ignored at the counter while others who were known by the staff were helped before me no eye contact from the staff or any acknowledgement i was even there after 10 minutes i left .
quaint charming and have never had a bad meal here wait staff friendly and prompt always a good choice .
fair to poor choice for breakfast hard to recommend this place the food is below average the service brisk to rude the interior average its on a dumpy street best to just keep walking plenty of better choices within just a few blocks .
after finishing the ny chocolate tour this was the most delightful find for dinner a lovely french bistro with exemplery service and perfectly prepared food the ambiance is casual romantic elegance we will return .
the place is constantly packed and yes the food is decent but the wait is very long and the organization pretty messy a couple people from the staff should also go back to customer service class .
charming café with great food we had the croques monsieur a burger w goat cheese and the scrambled eggs and bacon plate very nice good portion sizes and friendly and personable staff .
place a phone order pizza was cold harly any sauce even the garlic knots were cold cold antipasto wasnt that great unsatisfied customer .
nice friendly place good solid bistro food quite reasonable for the area prices not five stars since nothing particularly out of the ordinary but highly recommended .
the pizzas horrible not sure what the rest of their food is like but i think ill pass not to mention the staff is horrible and rude .
nice bistro in nice neighborhood pleasant atmosphere comfortable inside seating came here for lunch we had french onion soup salad omelette mussels and croque monsieur everything was wonderful .
wow what happened though food was terrible drinks were subparhuge bummer pork belly was an over cooked pork chop fix your martini olive game asap .
such a great neighborhood gem this little hole in the wall tucked into soho was such a surprise they have great wine and great steak frites its adorable and delicious .
24 clams i threw down for a fishermans stew twas chock full of onions garlic tomatoes thats true though i dont want to whine or to kvetch or to rant the fish in this stew at best it was scant .
very cute french bistro service is impeccable i ordered the steak which was delicious nice spot to either sit outdoors or cozy up in the back .
went here for the brunch and my food was eh kind of boring still i want to try again for dinner or lateday drinks and oysters .
brought my girlfriend here for vanentines day last year we each had the filet mignon and i remember it being pretty good great cozy romantic spot in the heart of soho .
overpriced and okay food .
one of my favorite french restaurants quality is consistent and the service is great i like the monk fish with wasabi sauce .
pathetic food and way ovepriced stupid fcking hipsters boom .
excellent french bistro fare i had roast duck breast with wild rice my companion had hanger steak with pommes frites both were cooked perfectly shared crime brûlée for dessert also excellent .
authentic it is not respectable texmex no how does this place stay in business superior to chipotle or even moes no chance .
went back and will keep going back had the mussels in white wine shallots garlic and broth with hot off the press bread that was great for dunking small and intimate friendly and in a perfect spot go for lunch dinner or snack .
worst mexican food ever taco bell would have been more authentic than this place the best part of dinner the chips which probably just came out of a bag .
went back here again on our return trip fabulous wait staff very attentive food was exceptional .
not as good as it looks food has no taste i ordered beef fajita and expected hot sizzling plate but the food was cold and very few shredded beef my wife ordered chicken enchilada which had no taste at all the only good thing was the service .
my wife and i literally came across the country to come to dinner here its that good .
have been a couple of times mostly tasty but todays lunch arrived cold .
i had a delicious dinner at bistro les amis a few weekends ago the scallops were wonderful read my full review here closet12 com201207soh… .
really rude people behind the counter no customer service its almost as though they enjoy being rude .
balthazar had one and a half hour wait so walked up the street to bistro les amis what a wonderful surprise meal was excellent and service superb .
very dirty bathroom as i noted in my check in please clean it and staff not friendly sandwich was ok but overpriced i dont recommend a visit .
this is a darling cozy bistro perfect for a cold rainy night i had the roasted breast of duck with mangohoney sauce and was perfectly delighted with my order i cannot wait to go back .
i went to two weddings here and please avoid it food was tasteless and service was bad personally i wish gordon ramsay would knock some sense into this place .
reservations are helpful in this cozy place luckily they accommodated us and a few more walk ins the service was fast and attentive and the food is very tasty .
coffee sauce on mashed potatoes servings that make you want to go out for pizza afterward if i wanted teenie portions of overpriced semieclectic food i would take the 7 into the city .
good location attentive service the prix fixe menu very good deal monday to thursday before 730 pm recommend the crispy saumon the rosemary chicken was a dry the mango sorbet was delicious will definitely come again for dinner .
waited 15 mins after seating for the server to come take an order enchilada was bland and ravioli was nothing to write home about the restaurant is cozy though .
was a good experience ordered a ton of food and all of it was tasty the oysters were okay the mussels werent bad at all and the server was very nice we plan on going again .
they dont honor reservations .
this is a great bistro feels authentic great service great atmosphere no pretense or cheesy people even though it is in soho take your mom close friends or a date .
no guacamole unless you order a steak not so mexican .
my favorite neighborhood placegreat foodgreat servicecozy and friendly atmosphere and vera makes the perfect gimlet .
i liked this rest before but when i visit this recently i was so disappointed by food and service i wont go there anymore .
great one of fav places .
too much sauce .
the food here is so good i ate here last week and had the curry chicken salad special it was absolutely perfect light and refreshing and not too spicy the decor is very french it reminded me so much of being in a little bistro in paris .
meh wasnt impressed at all soup tasted a bit like chlorine wash your dishes more thoroughly please portions were measly and the noodles really did not live up to their hypetoo soft not elastic enough .
loved this place great neighborhood spot small romantic bistro the service and food are exquisite if you are looking for a great location for new years eve this is a great option .
was hoping to be more impressed the noodles were a bit over boiled soggy lacking an elastic chewy texture the broth lacked flavor and had to add vinegar and chili for flavor serving size was ample for both meat and noodles for 56 per bowl .
not quite french offers consistent delicious food attentive and friendly staff good wines cozy atmosphere .
the food is great but the service needs mass improvement just smiling could make a huge difference .
cozy corner good menu nice wines great value 3 course early bird dinner is 530 to 7 for 25 bucks .
good dumplings but they gave me pork bone soup when i ordered steamed pork soup there was bone in every bite if you are into that sort of thing but it was very bland .
good food i always like a place i can get a good salad the outdoor seating is really only for 2 people at a time so i cant recommend this for groups a plus is that they have a full bar and wine a great date restaurant .
it was ok ill leave it at that .
nice lil corner bistro that i always seem to wander upon in soho great standard bistro fare .
meh had the veal parm saturday night tough and flavorless water refills were a struggle and the staff really couldnt have cared any less that we were there after dropping about 80 no alcohol here for 3 no thank you or acknowledgement on the way out kinda surprised .
good quality goat cheese salad yummy duck on country rice grains was kind of like a country french restaurant with asian and italian influences one of the first places with warm bread that ive been to in ny .
overpriced dry pizza that tasted like salted cardboard yum yum .
grownup atmosphere great place to take parents good service delicious food .
ordered a pizza to go on a friday which was half cooked i understand being busy but this had sausage on it that was still a little pink my neighbors like them but i am hard pressed to retry .
just had lunch here few days ago and it was truly fabulous had a big delicious seafood salad and my dad had a great crab cake sandwich all followed by amazing capuccinos very reasonably priced too go there .
this has to be the worst place ive ever been to the staff is rude and cant be bothered and the food is mediocre at its best the bartender needs an attitude adjustment do not waste your money on this dump .
cheese plates homemade bread ham hocks hanging in the windows on the way to the restroom and always excellent service lots of action in the bar always busy and always fun and the food and service are fantastic like arnold ill be back .
i live down the street from this hole if you like good food avoid this place like the plague its dirty the waitresss are rude and the food is terrible dont ever remember it being good but people still go to this hole .
one of my favorite restaurants of all time great food great people great atmosphere .
old neighborhood haunt would never stop in that neighborhood if it wasnt recommended by locals food ok service rough place is held together with duct tape and age not a bargain either .
this is my happy place amazing food and service worth the walk or drive from wherever you are i recommend the fresh mozzarella and hanger steak .
not sure why all the fan fare average at best and can be expensive for the quality .
stellar meal service and atmosphere we ordered all the small plates basically the papardelle and rolls twice cocktails and beer then finished the evening with whistle pig bourbon .
its a diner and it is ok this was a lack of choice at the time a bad lack of choice i had a turkey club processed not so good my bad .
gorgeous space delicious food farmtotable the best of vermont all under one roof ilovermont .
service is not good staff is friendly food is not of great quality might as well stay home .
hen of the wood is the best restaurant i have been to in burlington modernist cuisine is served on plates that are just fancy enough highlights included the hanger steak .
you can get better food from a high school lunch lady prices are insane for what you get not coming back .
everything and i mean everything was excellent our waiter was a little weird but the food was amazing it is very cold though so bring a jacket .
the food here was way too expensive for the quality i had the fettuccini with shrimp it didnt have any taste at all very bland sodas were 4 which is outrageous the server wrapped my food up in aluminum foil not a container bizarre will never return .
this was a fantastic meal two of us shared 4 small plates the oysters were fresh the steak tartare was awesome the best i have had the grilled octopus ok my daughter liked the beets i would return here again and again .
totally bummed the reviews for this place failed to mention no seating and its in a super sketchy record .
very well prepared food the lobster in iron plate beet salad and kale gratin and midday tries .
yelp usually is always spot on but this time i was let down i personally dont believe this place deserves a four star rating ive had better italian at chain restaurants just my opinion .
very good food creative menu but a bit pricey for such small portions the ambiance is lovely and just right for a dinner in town well go again .
college students make better pasta than this in their dorm rooms .
rabbit tagliatelle 910 grilled octopus 810 smoked bluefish 710 .
mustve just came on a bad day but the food was awful came out cold and didnt taste good had the looser salad sandwich and the eggs will not come back .
excellent steak and an excellent atmosphere also the oysters were very fresh ive heard the waterbury location is worth going to for the ambience but if you want to save yourself an hours worth of driving the burlington location is also excellent .
upset with salad which i paid for additional protein could barely find it major rip off .
i like this place the food taste good and they deliver to verona in a reasonable time frame note however their pizza is sicilian style .
food tasted good but was saturated in oil the togo boxes are the least sustainable and most wasteful things ive seen and i was shocked that a sustainable farmtotable place would waste so much .
i went in for a sit down dinner and was very pleased with my chicken florentine and my children loved the pizza .
only come here with a coupon from scoutmob otherwise price not worth overlooked salmon good sauce on mussels but shitty mussles dont charge me 9 for that salad .
best sandwiches thin chicken cutlets great margherita pie buffalo balls unreal pay 4 what u get good shizzle here .
flat tops food is really expensive and you cant fill urself up by one dish the waiters have bad attitudes as well .
no dogs permitted in the eveningsnights .
just had lunch at flat top and found the portions small and service inattentive nice atmosphere for a drink maybe but lunchnot so much .
excellent experience each time we go the eggplant roll ups are a must entire staff is amazing .
for dinner food overpriced portions stingy service incredibly slow waited about 30 mins for entrees 15 min for limited basic complementary starters bread and oil .
good food in a casual atmosphere will be back .
for a chinese buffet this place is terrible all food is gross and greasy not many choices at all i would have given one star but i found their dumpling is actually very good .
i just wish they would wrap their takeout hot parm selections in non stick paper before the foil wrap they are a mess to deal with .
meh just below being ok not really tasty kinda all around dingy looking in my opinion not authentic chinese food or close to it positives are some sushi choices fresh cut fruits and the alfredo seafood pasta was good i wont be back .
got delivery from frank anthonys tonight and i have to say that the wild mushroom pizza is the best pizza ive ever had hands down i especially love the thin crust eggplant rollatini was also delish tossed salad was decent too delivery was fast and prices reasonable .
i wish i could give negative stars i visited china grill buffet this evening with my family and it is by far the worst food i have ever had at a buffet in addition to terrible food this place is over priced and has mediocre service .
great service and great food franky and alan catered my wifes surprise bday party and everyone raved about the food try the eggplant and pasta specials .
food was average on par with most chinese buffets table was dirty and so was silverware overall impression was tat it wasnt the cleanest place overall some people were doing some serious eating in there some arguing over crab legs too never seen anything like that before .
although this is a very small place the food is very good .
this place is just gross the food is of the cheapest quality and very greasy theres not a whole lot of selection either especially for vegetarians my feet were even sticking to the floor yuck .
the food here was very good and its a nice clean atmosphere i tried the pannini sandwich and was very happy also had some pasta which was done right i will go back soon .
thanks giving balls are a must do .
it just gets better every time we go back the sicilian pork chops the pizza the burger the fresh mozzarella the sandwiches on their fresh bread there is nothing and i mean nothing that i have had from fas that isnt great nice staff friendly owners .
our anniversary dinner lets start with the seafood overcooked scallops and shrimp along with undercooked haddock also enjoyed the instant potatoes who enjoys paying 23 00 for a meal and gets a pile of instant mash potatoes will never go back .
great fresh food everything was very flavorful pear salad was excellent from the other reviews it sounds like we have to come back and try the pizza when we are back in the area we will definitely do that come back and try more delicious food .
dont go over price steak was tasteless service was great but just another glossy cover of a resturant .
amazing food everything is really flavorful and fresh they have great specials the service has always been good to me .
the philly i got from the street vender for lunch was far better than the burger i paid 20 for here the atmosphere service fantastic and cost gave me the impression i was in for a great experience theres no excuse for that menu item .
very accommodating and friendly service slightly pricey but yummy pastries and reasonably priced foods worth stopping in .
tourist trap id rather eat taco bell 51 for 2 drinks and shrimp cocktail kill yourself .
this place is hit or miss they have a good lunch special and pasta dinner special in the beginning of the week pasta entrées and sandwiches are good but the service can really blow .
skip it one of the worst services in nyc had to wait more than an hour to be seated .
love love love love marzullos their sauce is amazing the staff is friendly and extremely helpful they maintain a family like atmosphere if you go to the deli area you see an amazing assortment of italian goodies dont forget to stop at the coffee bar or gelato station .
had reservation for 745 still not seated at 9 kept getting different stories about how long the wait was obviously they dont care about their customers time so dont waste any by coming here .
this place is awesome for what it is a homey italian restaurant with great food nice decor and attentive service for a reasonable price nice enough for a date but also accommodating for a family .
food was ok nothing spectacular hostess was rude service indifferent worst of all roaches crawling on steps as we walked out grossed me out will never return .
marzullos is a steady in our montclair dining rotation the food is tasty and served in a timely fashion with large portions so theres plenty to take home the tablecloths are covered with white paper and the kids get crayons to color on it .
ive dined here many times before and the food is good but if you go for a weekday lunch and the hostess tells you its going to be a 15 minute wait do not believe a word she is saying .
this place frequently caters at my job the roast beef is to die for excellent salads and cakes the staff is incredibly friendly i dont know what the instore experience is like but i would love to check it out .
i just ordered salmon at a ruby tuesdays in tallahassee currently traveling there for work it was at least 50 better than the arctic char at hillstone can you tell im still mad .
its a local version of a subway with a larger verity of eating options if you are worried about getting the right amount of food for your dollar you are definitely getting more for what you are paying .
pretty expensive for a few hamburgers and drinks the drinks mixed drinks are 15 not including tip are pricey weak the food was mediocre on a brighter note the waitstaff was friendly and attentive but for 50pp ive definitely had better meals .
i love this place they make the best italian sandwiches and i used to go here all the time the one in orange if only i still lived in jersey yumm 0 .
urrgh if i wanted chain restaurants id go to new jersey plus its overpriced and service is patchy at best one waitress tried to convince my colleague that a manhattan is made of vermouth and champagne totally clueless i say .
a very nice sandwich place awesome quality and magnificant size of burgers great service and attention from stuff great take out food 20 years of existance confirm still perfect organization recommend italian cheese steak sandwich .
this place is only good for a first date or a business meeting basically if you want to impress someone just cross over to the next town over in west orange and theres like 5 peruvian restaurants which are a lot better portion wise and price wise .
i visited this place today and it was a very pleasant experience the customer service was great i ordered the liver cleansing juice and pbj smoothie they were both delicious i highly recommend this café to fellow vegetarians and people who love high quality juices .
based on their high ranking i decided to try and i ordered online through the yelp app but thirty minutes later received a call from delivery com informing me that they have no delivery guys your order has been cancelled .
great food great people and a great vibe i will definitely go again .
not horrible i guess but food is either cold or really greasy but on the other hands its one of the only decent bbq joints in town .
another gem in montclair great smoothies coffee and wifi .
my husband and i went for brunch we live a block away we ordered the side car breakfast i honestly make better with my eyes closed the grits were very thick no white toast really .
this place has a great vibe great people homemade fresh goodies and tunes i love it .
this place blows terrible food and long wait no space we had to squeeze in to our seats and squeeze in and out of the restaurant i would never come here again bad bad bad .
what a warm welcome friendly atmosphere and delicious drinks we will definitely be coming back .
we were told 3040 minute wait it was 90 mins no one told us it would be longer also there is no frickin chocolate milk go here if you like the smell of hipsters and overpriced craft beer .
this place makes really nice juice i really love it the juice here even inspired me to buy my own juicer i am glad a juice place exists in our area .
once very good and unique now has all the personality of an applebees .
thai youth coconut super smoothie addicted enough said also the staff is super nice a little bit expensive for a broke college student like me but once a week its well worth the indulgence .
luckily the food was good service was terrible and we waited an hour for our meal they even made my very pregnant sister get out of her seat and stand because our whole party had yet to arrive never going back .
awesome place to stop for lunch or a super healthy juice great friendly service and everything is super fresh i hope they open another one a little south on the parkway .
12 dollar breakfast sidecar is a a fine example of this neighborhoods gentrification such a pity .
best juice around .
very nice atmosphere friendly service but if i order a teeny portion of a bean platter that is obviously from a can and thats not an issue that they sell for 13 50 plus tax and tip no freaking way .
best chicken soup in all of manhattan maybe the world .
disappointing incredibly rude owner took her time to take order while not busy with anything else took our pastry from the table before we were finished will not return .
i love this place the food is delicious and the place is small and cozy i could never pass up a great plate of bistec and arroz blanco with great service .
owner and wait staff were incredibly rude the coffee and pastries are good but the staff could not be more unwelcoming .
food from home always a plus if you want real latin food that is one of maybe 5 places in nyc you will get real latin food i eat there at least 5 times a month respectfully its always good .
the best banh mi ive ever had and certainly the best in all of new york too bad the hair wedged deep in mine ensures ill never have it again .
beef stew with carrotpotatos dish is tasty its a real home cooked taste i paid 7 40 for a small great food and price would definitely recommend trying this place .
horrible chicken sandwich the chicken was absurdly dry and what added oil to the fire was that the texture was shredded i mean like who eats shredded chicken now im not a cat you know i still have my molars .
finally after a week of eating deli breakfast my good old spanish breakfast oh man so good .
went back yet again and still way too much msg left with a soaring headache will have to pass on this place despite their pleasant tasting sandwiches .
the food here is great love this place im not spanish but on xmas i love to order pernil and take it to my parents house because no one makes pernil like these people love spanish food .
mystery meat seriously unidentifiable i ordered chicken next time i will go with tofu .
holy amazing we ordered takeout from genas grill on saturday night and wow the pork was juicy and delicious the rice beans were amazing and im not really into rice beans generally and the sweet plantains were so sweet and perfect i cant say enough about this place .
went to ba xuyen for some banh mi per a fantastic review on serious eats and i just thought it was alright i much prefer the banh mi at vanessas dumplings .
best puerto rican food in the east village ive ordered here multiple times and the people here are super nice even delivery only took like 10 minutes .
havent been there recently sorry for the wrong post .
great cheap caribbean food .
indifferent and inadequate service insistence on giving a table next to the bathroom when the whole restaurant was empty was just plain stupid food is just ok .
authentic dominican grub the portions were perfect and the staff was friendly if you are with a large group 3 you might want to order takeout as space is limited .
really bad case of dry mouth after eating the sandwich would not order from this place again .
simple and tasty latino south american spanishcuban food my fried eggs with peas rice hit the spot i really want to try the paella but will have to wait i dig old diners run daily by owners .
maybe im a traditionalist maybe im just spoiled but these sandwiches just do not stack up to the original bahn mi that you get in northeast philly or northern virginia theyre decent sandwiches but something is missing .
awesome roasted chicken and very cheap .
just not very good its too westernized and not enough authenticity people who dont really understand banh mi or are used to the other crap in nyc will love it though .
if you can speak even just a little spanish you can sit at the counter and its like your grandma is feeding you wanna try this a little more of that something else no im too full and then it costs 9 .
could be better with a lot more effort by the staff food is just ok and over salted nothing to write home about get rid ofthe xmas light for gods sake expensive so for value it scores quite low too .
went here for the first time tonight and it was great tiny little lunch counter place the pernil asado was simple and fantastic very flavorful got it with yellow rice cuban sandwich was also really good very authentic cooking .
not bad food but nothing worth the prices fast service but as a small restaurant its too crowded and no privacy i wouldnt go again .
this is cheap real dominican soul food as good as it gets delicious chicken and yummy yummy tostones and platanito maduro it is what it is and it is so good .
rude rude service very very loud at long table felt rushed very arrogant pastas are very average had a microwaved chocolate soufflé that came out 2 minutes after ordered burning hot wont return looks authentic but its not .
came here on my work break all i bought was maduros the women behind the counter were so friendly im definitely coming here more often and ill get bigger plates very affordable and who can go wrong with dominican food not i .
rude service saw cook push down garbage with same gloves used to handle food left after a single glass of wine food tastes good but after seeing how unclean the kitchen was quickly lost appetite .
tried the dominican cake here not too long ago damn that hit the spot and was worth the inexpensive price .
one other quick thought when the waiter took our check he just assumed the cash was for him at no point did we say keep the change or the change is for you very presumptuous and rude .
great local spot for a quick pernil sandwich or pork ribs with rice and beans the ladies working here are very sweet and call you mami or papi .
i wouldnt know what is the quality of the food here because i waited for an hour and half with a party of six and had to watch while they sat every couple that arrived after us very disrespectful .
genas win try it right now if you have a spanishspeaking friend bring your tour guide its not required but it helps whatever you do make sure you try the chicken empanadas and the arroz guisado que rico .
just called to make a reservation and the man mentioned no reservations and hung up on me i had no idea geez rude .
worth running away from home for .
just one word about this place sucks .
the chips arbs guacamole are amazing the chip is very thick my favorite is the al pastor tacos with a grapefruit margarita .
used to be one of my favorite neighborhood places to grab a glass of wine but when i went in tonight at 10pm they wouldnt let me sit at the bar that had plenty of seats without ordering dinner such a shame wont be going back .
great place i had the pork tacos they were really good habanero margarita was amazing warning its really hot i also had the enchiladas really good great place .
staff is just plain rude .
this is my go to mexican spot in the les vegetarians love it here too expect a wait but its worth it .
great atmosphere but the food was cold the sparkling wine was a bit warm not very good ventilation so you walk out smelling like food also its very drafty so the food gets very cold very fast the food is ok not the best .
the habenero grapefruit margaritas are to die for the jalepeno is great too i loved the guacamole the shrimp .
good food but the 2x ive come to this particular store the place was dirty it detracts quite a bit from the meal so many people preparing food none taking care of the dining area .
good mexi food nothing mind blowing but all around good nothing was bad and i just kind of like this place not worth a trip out of your way but if you live in the hood it is worth making it a semi regular joint .
today was the second time that i got food poisoning from the food at this location needless to say i wont be going back both my boyfriend and i got the chicken and we both got very sick ugh i highly suggest you dont go here .
delicious delicious food and a grapefruit margarita hit the spot cool hidden place the only down side is that it is small and on a saturday night crowded well worth it though .
been to this location 3xs and food is superdelicious however customer service not so much the staff isnt friendly and it seems as if youre bothering them if youre in between locations choose the other one .
great little authentic spot .
ive eaten at many different chipotles across the us but this one is by far the worst in terms of speed of service the staff is very slow the food is excellent however .
great place to eat definitively overpriced considering the portion size and quality even by nyc standards though would be 5 stars if the prices were 25 lower everything on the menu is great .
got dinner to go for 2 they package extremely hot food in plastic containers leaving you with a soggy mess because of the condensation got one pita for a ton of food which i think cost me an extra 1 for whole wheat .
pretty tasty a bit overrated for the hip but its kinda nice the place is small so get ready to be close to people d .
cold bland pita ingredients in the falafel sandwich that sounded wonderful but failed to come together into a tasty sandwich the falafel balls themselves leave something to be desired 2 stars instead of 1 because i think it was their first week being open .
excellent margaritas so worth the 10 really cute place loved the vibe great for summer nights the server wasnt the best kind of curt and not very helpful .
i ordered the steak salad and the steak was cold pieces of philly cheesesteak meat the only steak salad ive ever had that doesnt use real meat i ended up picking around the meat .
ive been here for brunch many times the drinks are so fresh and yummy i keep ordering the moletes with a fried egg its the most amazing brunch ever i need to go for dinner bc im sure it will be amazing go here now .
oversalted bbq chicken pizza ok tomato basil i liked the thin crust but the dough itself wasnt that good better than i expected though since i hadnt heard of this place before today it reminded me of pizza at kitchen zinc .
staff is great and food and margaritas are always on point i just wish the crowds would go away as id eat there a few times a week .
summer rolls were expensive 8 for two small rolls claypot catfish was good reminded me of home but all in all it was quite overpriced for vietnamese food bf got the pork belly which was decent it was 50 plus tip for the 3 dishes .
great atmosphere and good mexican food the drinks are pretty surprising a nice place for a fun lunch or dinner .
starving on a layover and place says its open til 2am im calling at 1235am and after it rings 20 times someone hangs up seriously .
such a yummy meal the sandia fresca was super refreshing and the red salsa had a great smoky spiciness to it mama knows wassup cause her secret mole sauce in the chicken enchiladas was one of the best i had my bfs barbacoa was also on point .
tried ordering and first person said they could deliver although he may not have understood what we were trying to say when we called back they said they actually dont deliver and it was the frustrating experience of my life get it together .
warning the taquitos are not taquitos it is a small taco with strawberries and cojita cheese they are delicious though get the michelada with negra modelo it wont disappoint .
the chicken here is great but the restaurant is a mismanaged mess service is terrible chaotic rude and its impossible to order by phone no one picks up too bad its so badly run because the neighborhood is desperate for good restaurants .
the margaritas are to die for be aware that when they say spicy it is spicy love the mole enchilada come in early its small and cozy service is friendly and helpful good place to spend the afternoon we came to see a world cup soccer game .
pio pio is not great the chicken was really good but overall not the authentic experience i wad hoping for the ketchup and french fries were strike one not authentic at all then the avocado salad i ordered was definitely sub par i dont recommend this place .
excellent food drinks super crowded and tight seating but good for couples and small groups if you dont mind the wait service is pretty good too .
cockroaches we ordered food from this place and we opened our bag to find many cockroaches crawling around in it should be enough said for people to not eat here .
loved it a cute dark and cozy spot for a date super crowded but im a fan try the seafood tacos and ceviche portions are small but delish .
my first visit became my last purchased two subs taste was better than many other places but nothing to write home about the guy who rang me up was outright rude i would give this shop a big zero for their customer service .
best mexican place in manhattan where if u want ur cocktail less sweet all is custom made fish taco was amazing beats la esquina which was my 1 spit to go for authentic mexican .
this is so funny im assuming the top review with 5 stars is someone who works for subworks because they actually messaged me to get a life when they obviously created an account only to review subworks so stephanie get a life and a real job .
so delicious every single time its small and gets packed quick but the hosts are good about staying on top of filling the empty spots dont think twice about the wait beware the spiciest margarita is no joke .
once a great local sub shop with good subs not sure what happened here .
this place is small but deadly i love the steak tacos and grapefruit margarita its even better when they play 90s hip hop its one of my favorite places to be when it snows because this play can get overwhelmingly crowded so go early or late .
ordered delivery to my hotel which came quickly it wasnt good the chicken had a weird flavor and the hummus was gross the bread was fine i was pretty disappointed with the meal .
came here right after work with a friend so it was relatively empty gradually became crowed after awhile the food was really good and the drinks were delish love the young and lively crowd cant wait to go back .
i ordered chicken gyro shawarma for delivery while got grilled chicken instead to make things wrong the delivery guy refused to give me correct amount of changes because he ran out of 1 dollar bills the wrong experience ive ever had .
the best mexican food ive had in a really long time just expect at least a 90 minute wait very worth it though .
i just ordered an entree size dish 14 it came in a lunch box size rob a bank why dont you i added a rice pudding so its 24 with tax see picture i posted .
i love this place mole enchiladas and spicy margaritas are my go tos probably the best mole in the city if you ask me its not cheap and it usually takes some time to be seated but it is worth it .
horrific and so not worth it i am appalled lamb chops and lamb kebab was not worth the 25 bucks i would never come back .
drinks are good and the atmosphere is fun with the aesthetic of a typical small and hip lower east side bar all of this is great but i come here mostly for the chips and salsa which are the perfect compliment to a night of drinks .
the gyros make you feel like your having a heart attack right after too greasy for my taste .
the tortilla soup is delicious the calamari tacos are yummy too the joint is really small though and gets really noisy so be ready to yell over your tacos .
the meat is good sauce is bad service is bad definitely a take out place because they care about fulfilling their delivery orders before the people who sits at the restaurant i waited about 30 minutes before my food came out sauce was not creamy and lacks flavor .
dont get why its chino service was good host looked like russel brandt which was cool food was pretty authentic very good quality definitely recommend but didnt wow me which is why only 4 stars .
slow cheap and mediocre skip it much better at hummus kitchen and others nearby .
cool little spot always fun and not to expensive love the ceviche but i realy come for the jallepeno margs watch out there spicy expect an hour wait but they will call you cell when ready so you can go to bar next door dont expect fancy service .
pizza slices were soggy and doughy low quality cheese and sauce serviceable for little falls i guess .
great mexican food in a warm friendly environment tight communal type seating but very pleasant my shrimp dish wvodka was excellent as was the other dishes ordered you cant go wrong in this place try it once and you will be hooked .
two stars why cant they stay consistent i ordered a pie and calamari last night and both sucks someone please let the owners know they shouldnt cut corners especially since there are other pizza spots to choose from .
margaritas are outstanding here i had barboca lamb dish and calamari tacos definitely ill comeback again .
you will wait forever to even give your order then wait another lifetime for a glass of water i cant even talk about the food because im still waiting for just my water .
ceviche was excellent as was the chorizo quesadilla tacos were good but the fish tacos missed by high expectations the place is always packed even on our third attempt was given an hour wait time which speaks to its popularity but takes some of the charm away .
good pizza terrible fried calamari you can tell its frozen and been really frozen it takes forevee to finish 1 ring because its grossly chewey and stale tasting .
amazing place quiet lower east side bar restaurant have to try the jalapeño marguerita it has a bite i forget the meal i had back in march of this year some sort of burrito but it was just flawless .
this place used to be good not sure what happened food is salty pizza is soggy and service is slow and unfriendly will hestiate to try again .
everything was great guacamole superb top shelf margarita excellent and my servers accent is sexy the lighting is beautiful so is the music .
rude waitress sashimi was not fresh at all i worked at a sushi restaurant so i can differentiate fresh toro and old toro fresh toro definitely melts in your mouth old toro doesnt and it has a weird texturetaste along with a slightly darker tint .
slightly expensive and no happy hour but i dont care great staff great music and best tortilla soup ive had ever in nyc and i order it at every mexican place i go to seeing if i can find anything better raspberry paloma yes please .
wasnt impressed spicy crunchy roll had too much sauce on it miso was thick and had a weird texture although it did have a good flavor i will not be back .
great food great drinks great enviance and good service .
the olive garden of mexican food below mediocre service wasnt bad and the chips were fantastic ambience was fine music is annoying we had to wait 15 minutes for a table and it was not worth it .
great atmosphere attentive staff amazing drinks may take a bit to get a table but worth it if you can take the heat definitely try the grapefruit habañero margarita .
the nachos grande is super tiny and you barely get more than 5 chipswas also super greasy and the chips kept breaking because they were so oily service is poorthis was not the first time that i have had unsatisfactory service will not be coming back .
best mexican spot in the city hands down go for the guac and chips and steak tacos and you will not be disappointed also fresh lime margaritas are amazing you may have to wait a little long on most nights but it is well worth the wait .
after hearing great raves and reviews we finally came here well worst ever margaritas dirty glasses salsa was so not tasty and watery and food was horrible so so so disappointed .
waited for about half hour forty minutes it was extremely worth shall be going back again .
disappointed there salsa is not good at all .
came here late on a monday night and it was packed best guac in the city by far really fun atmosphere and delicious jalepeno margaritias very spicy this place is definitely going to be one of my go to spots .
ive been going here for the last year and it seems they change the chef portions are not the same and the quality of the food .
awesome margaritas amazing mole enchiladas i thought it was a little pricey especially seeing as the drinks menu is handwritten on a piece of cardboard overall however great experience .
i got a margarita and a veggie burrito here the margarita was way too salty and i didnt even order salt on my rim my veggie burrito was greasy the rice was bland and the refried beans were burned i wouldnt come back to this place again .
really enjoyed the fish tacos though you definitely need to add some sides if youre hungry quite small chips with salsa and guacamole were excellent the jalapeno and habanero infused margaritas are great for those who love some heat .
food was overpriced and was just okay nothing great service was awful took an hour to get out food after our waiter disappeared after taking our order .
i had the soupa azteca excellent and the bistek torta which was highly recommended by my server and it was two thumbs up and a happy tummy ill be back soon .
bland way over priced its no and kind of dirty 55 00 for two basic entrees and a nann bread we drank water give me a break this was our first try and i can think of no reason to ever go back .
barrio chino is fantastic the margaritas are delicious the atmosphere is cool i love their salsa and their food is actually really good coming from a southwesterner only con is that it is overpriced .
found this place overpriced for slow service and sub par food reminded me of the taj group of hotels food service which is also overly dependent on ornate awkward presentation and mediocre taste .
very small so you have to wait to be seated the food is really good and drinks as well the waitress was very pushy i guess because it was people waiting but hey i also had to wait before .
food was very fresh tasting the seasoning was very bland i like my spice and none was evident service was spotty as well .
best mexican in new york everything is great habenero grapefruits are amazing def get the steak tacos gauc shrimp enchiladas if you are eating and drinking it gets a little pricey but totally worth it .
heres a short post i will never go back food is not even average prices are very high go to satish palace on bloomfield ave to see what real indian should taste like .
the mexican food here is delicious we had the enchiladas also the bartenders are very nice and they make some pretty coolunique drinks small place so gets crowded easily but definitely a spot to fulfill any mexican food cravings .
if you enjoy over priced beer rude servers and a side of flys with your meal then this is the place for you .
best tacos and margaritas in manhattan wish it was bigger but goes with the territory only wish they had more of a reasonable wait time .
it just isnt that good good beer selection good mussels and absolutely horrible sandwich called the horta thought it would work because im a fan of victor horta never confuse architects with sandwiches .
phenomenal some of the best mexican ive ever had worth the wait great date spot .
saturday afternoon fail absent service food was under seasoned and i saw our servers raw buttcrack cmon buttcrack .
really nice service and laid back environment food was delicious and reasonably priced we had the grapefruit margaritas chips and guac and chicken and steak tacos chips and guac were very very good tacos were good but not amazing ive had better but for the price theyre good .
went last night and ordered fish and chips waiter said they did not serve fish and chips i told him it was on the specials sign fish tasted wrong turns out they made it with tilapia should have stuck with the mussels .
this place is great the food is good and the prices are affordable i loved the grapefruit margarita .
beer options are excellent mussels are severely disappointing .
ceviche was delish tasted so fresh chicken tacos were made well the jalapeno margarita was so hottttt but so good if you like it hot get it make a reservation this place is always busy .
i really really want to like this restaurant but i just cant the staff is very nice knowledgeable and friendly the food is good honestly i just cant drum up any enthusiasm .
off the chain snaps fingers .
overpriced we paid 70 for 2 vegetarian entrees and an appetizer it was not worth it .
hands down the best and really only good sitdown mexican ive had in the city this place is good even for san diego .
when we saw they serve fake syrup and charge an extra 2 50 for real syrup we left hello this is a pancake house right just not right why come here then when you can have the wonderful pancakes at perkins right up the road in e windsor .
very solid menu i love this place its dark and gives you that les feeling youre looking for food is excellent service is attentive definitely recommend .
i keep trying pjs in the new location and it continues to be the worst service the food is decent average breakfast i think 3 xs for the new location is my limit .
hip spot good food great music enchiladas verde is where its at ask for a side of rice bit spicier than your average enchilada .
pizza is decent but thats about it chicken parm was undercooked and atrocious .
an excellent mexican place its cute and quaint and has fantastic margaritas and guacamole its small and doesnt have a lot of seating so plan ahead .
if you call to place a delivery order you are guaranteed to speak to the rudest coldest nastiest man in the universe .
go there during off hours to get a table the chicken soup and guacamole and chips are amazing i also come here for the margaritas the tacos are decent but i recommend sticking to the soup and chips because they are packed full of awesome flavor .
not good just about edible ambience is poor decor is ugly pizza delicious but the rest of the food was tasteless they charge waaaaaaaaay too much for tastless food and an unpleasant atmosphere .
food is good fun environment only downside is its hard to get seats .
raw pizza and the sandwiches tasted awful ended up ordering good pizza from juniors instead not the first time this has happened to us we will not be back .
delicious food and a great bar with plenty of tequila and mezcal if you dont want to wait come for lunch its dead during the day .
everything we got was sub par i certainly wont be going back with so many other options in the area also getting there and parking is a pain the way that the road is set up there .
this tiny place is a gem great margaritas of various flavors tacos enchiladas everything my friend and i sat at the bar and really enjoyed our meal and drinks and chats with the bartender its a bit hard to find but once you do youll enjoy it .
worst pizza experience ever this place is horrible order dominos or pizza hut is there anywhere in burlington that has good new york style pizza .
yum the guacamole is awesome we all got tacos portions were small but very good beverages were a bit pricy they basically doubled the bill 98 bucks for lunch for 3 was a little steep with only one drink each get te guacamole its well worth it .
ok pizza ok wings cheap decent .
awesome margaritas and fish tacos .
prix fixe menu plus calamari everything way too salty but the wines helped get over the taste good effort just needs refinement .
im from southern california so typically i cannot stand mexican food here in the city and margaritas are often horrible barrio chino however makes some pretty great food and even better margaritas stop by for lunch lots of room then and prices are pretty good .
dishes were either bland or ridiculously over salted space was loud and cramped no plans to return .
awesome tacos only complaint is that its noisy and there was a really bad smell throughout the restaurant .
food wasnt great theres pretty much nothing beside salad good place for drinks but send not worth the price for food its terrible .
like everything you wish la esquina was and is everything it isnt faves are the guac and the chile with walnut cream sauce try all the flavored margaritas loud cozy and funky on the inside .
tldr bad food great aleonly selection too expensive i expected more huge selection of ales but almost no lagers on tap a gingerman by any other name is still a gingerman .
i cant say enough amazing things about this les resto the staff is amazing the margaritas are on point and the steak and mango salad has become a food group all in all you will not be disappointed .
dont ever disagree with the christian bartender the service here is horrible arguing with a patron over what a beer should taste like is ridiculous ill never go back to cask republic which is a pitty because it had potential as a place that i would have frequented .
this place has amazing takeout love to eat and the ingredients are fresh .
notorious e g g flying breakfast burrito brothers can i just order breakfast save me the egregious food names the super hipster rude staff the below average coffee and the average food there are to many coffee shopcafes in this town for you to get my business .
loved the margeritha loved chips with dips loved the atmosphere loved everything here .
the food here is cheap and pretty good but the service is terrible the manager is extremely rude i couldnt even believe it i would of come back if it wasnt for her would not recommend coming here cheer up bitch its just bagel sandwiches .
enchiladas verdes and watermelon juice cant think of a better meal to start the day off right .
this food is disgusting i will never eat here again i would advise you to stay away quite honestly i questioned exactly what kind of meat i was eating .
ambience was great as were the tacos al pastor only drawback was the tortillas were slightly undersized which made them difficult to handle .
maybe im just not into the southern comfort food thing but i see no reason to wait an hour and a half for a table here go to harlem its quicker and tastier .
authentic mexican food and great drinks try the chorizo cheese crisp with a margarita the space is super small so go early sit at the bar to expect to wait a while .
an ok place if you are a beersportbar lover however their too traditional comfort food menu really bored me maccheese a lot of fried stuff fatty sauces etc doesnt feel intimate too loud not enough personal space too many people not my cup of tea .
amazing guac amazing pork tacos amazing grapefruit margaritas .
my waiter was sexy thats why he got a good tip not because he was good or anything the food was a heart attack waiting to happen although it was ok i did enjoy my plates pickles for the app but service was very slow .
youre missing out if youve not been here yet really good food some of the best margaritas in the city and attractive staff as well as patrons you may have to wait some to be seated but grab a drink near by worth it .
very loud the service is actually good for the poor space offered to their servers and bus boys but they can only do so much if the restaurant is overrated and the food is just ok .
it would be hard to get better mexican than at barrio chino the food is great the atmosphere is great and the wait staff is friendly make sure to get the tacos .
update after all this i received an email from the restaurant apologizing and to pls call the manager to make another res i called was told the manager was busy and theyd call me back they never did .
it was awesome .
i dont get the hype waited over 2 hours for a table what is the appeal someone please shed some light .
great little spot for tequilla and mexican i love the chile relleno with vegetable and scrambled eggs one star off for 6 dollar tecate cans thats just not right .
we waited 1 hour for a table the menu is a bw paper the food is good but the service terrible overpriced for a not fancy place .
best tequila drinks around its tight inside but if you want good mexican food accompanied by a jalapeño margarita then this is where to go .
absolutely incredible food but it couldnt make up for the absolutely terrible service if youre a restaurant of this caliber your hostesses should have at least a basic understanding of how your restaurant runs and how to treat customers sadly we will not be returning .
best fish taco ive ever had .
i think its a bit overrated service so speedy you kind of feel violated food so intensely heavy you need at least 45 hours to digest it before sleeping i get the concept but its just not for me .
just went back cuz my first visit was great margaritas still stellar but this time around the food wasnt as great still one of the best mexican around and i love the vibe of this cramped little east village gem .
good beer selection but you can get that at george keeleys on the next block the food is decent but over priced for comfort food .
excellent food great service creative dishes and reasonable prices not to mention the people watching is divine .
chicken biscuit came with 2 chicken tenders rather than a single chicken filet sausage gravy was really salty as were the cheese grits that came with the order fried pickles werent the expected slices but were deep breaded quartered gherkins staff were generally friendly but forgetful and slow .
so good we ordered all of the margaritas since we had a big group elderflower rasberry jalepeno jabenero al amazing the salsas are all fresh the tacos are so tasty enchiladas are divine go .
awful food an hour later still feeling ill impossible to find anything on the menu thats not deep fried if youre going to use up this quantity of calories at least the food should be good .
great mexican cuisine .
i dont get all the love pickles mushy no real flavor service mehhh only the rosemary lemonade drink was good the tequila one tasted like sugary cough syrup the food fried fried fried greasy oh a salmon salad or salmon .
i got it here probably the best elderflower margarita ive ever had yum but dont come here for the service the lady in charge is seating seriously has issues with communication but the bartenders are super friendly .
unfortunately we had a very bad experience raw bloody chicken forgotten orders totally discombobulated would definitely skip it .
yes run dont walk this place is great i recommend the very strong mojitos unless youre an alcoholic these drinks are groovy just look at my face it tells the story .
i agree with with danielle and her assessment the drink was subpar expensive and all ice take the ice out and youre left with a shot not a cocktail plus they werent strong read weak and tasted mediocre cant wait to not come back .
i love this place great food great people good music mojitos are awesome .
you can chew their seafood forever and swallow the whole piece still pork chops were dry the staik ordered as rare came welldone with at least quater of it being pure fat the service was good as were side items such as bread .
food is quite enjoyable super hipster vibe the whole place was lit by 4 candles when i went at 1230 am doesnt look like much from the street so its easy to walk past .
the food was ok could have used more flavor it has a nice decor but just ok overall .
mmmmm i love this place everything is good the guac the pollito the steak the only bad thing is that its always crowded .
samba special panini not so special bland with wrong bread choice lentil soup had no flavor .
great tacos and margaritas would go back for sure a must for mexican .
i was a little disappointed with the food here i heard a lot of good things from friends so i checked it out the portions were small although reasonably priced and were rather bland neat environment though and unlimited coffee is always a plus .
this place has the best margaritas and bartenders in all of new york .
the food is good but my wife finds the place a bit on the dirty side it is a small place but worth a try if you are not bothered by dust give it a try .
love the food love the drinks love the service love the atmosphere it doesnt get better than this ladies and gentlemen .
the food menu is short and weird and with so many other bars in philly there is nothing impressive about this one at all .
best mexican in les .
was there over an hour and no one would take our food order asked for the check and when that didnt come we finally had to leave money for our drinks and go .
great food reasonable prices worth the wait i would especially recommend the mango salad and the guacamole i will be back .
somehow this place mistakenly got on the food network its terrible soup out of a can lousy fries greasy sandwiches go elsewhere yelpers whatever you heard about this place being great for vegetarians was all lies its only attractive to people who lack taste buds .
yummy tacos chill vibe top shelf tequila .
had the meatloaf and it was frozen and then microwaved the brussel sprouts were hard and very undercooked been in philly for a month now and this was the worst meal i have had and i ate mcdonalds once .
this place is my obsession if youre looking for great mexican food look no further not the greatest for large groups but regardless its amazing recommend recommend .
food poisoning from the traditional burger obviously they dont give enough attention to their kitchen hygiene the taste of the burger wasnt bad but the subsequent gi infection was would avoid this place entirely .
consistently solid food service and drinks great decor super cool vibe and really reasonable get the enchiladas they never disappoint im here a few times a year whenever the craving hits .
never made it past the hostess she was so rude we decided to leave and vowed never to return .
amazing food jalepeno margarita and prices watch for waiting periods which could be upto 2 hours on a weekend but worth the wait food and drinks .
food is good but the staff is among the worst in the city if you dont know the secret handshake fellow hipster they ignore you or are just snarky there are better places to get a burger and a beer .
homemade chips heavenly guacamole specialty margaritas hip crowd and a buzzy atmosphere after my disappointing visit to casa mezcal i happily ventured back to this proven spot just around the corner the wait is loooooong but well well worth it .
ive been here about 2 times and was never really impressed both times ive had to wait a long time to for a server and when i finally received some service the staff hasnt been too friendly .
love this place great food music service its such a cute spot small quaint the drinks are yummy as well perfect lil date spot or get together with a small group of friends .
food terrible modernization of classic staples with terrible execution good service is the only thing keeping this from being a onestar review but who needs bad food served to them well .
habanero and tequila are enough for this tedious old fool to put up with a room full of vnecks .
what a disappointment after all the reviews i was expecting much better atmosphere was why i gave 2 stars food eh not very creative service was ok .
excellent service finest tequila and margaritas highly flavorful eats absolutely lovely thanks guys .
no liquor wtf this brunch was not as great as it couldve been .
great margaritas loved the classic mojito and jalapeno one very good salsa i must come back and try other entrees .
its just ok .
yes drinks are good but the squid tacos are off the hook .
food was nothing special i love cheese but i was disappointed with their mac and cheese the menu needs variety i had their roasted ravioli and it was dry i liked their grilled cheese sandwich service was good but i dont think i will return .
amazing margaritas try the grapefruit margarita hard to get a table but totally worth it great music .
pretty disappointed considering the hype food seems intentionally bland not bad but draft beer selection limited and gimmicky good service not likely to return there are much better ways to drop 75 on a date in astoria .
between their tacos pazole chips and salsa and margaritas seriously they have my heart i prefer to go for lunch instead of dinner mostly due to the crowd that they attract .
trendywendy spendy and pretendy .
authentic and great mexican food with good drinks .
we had two sandwiches mac and cheese and the specialty sodas the sodas were good the rest were mediocre i spent 42 with tip not worth it sorry .
only reason not to review is so that it doesnt get tooooo popular but it deserves to be so fantastic drinks food atmosphere .
22 for a grilled cheese and a beer 1 the sandwiches were on the small side 2 the sandwiches were tasty 3 only vegetarian options available which theoretically should bring the cost down 4 22 for a grilled cheese and a beer it hurts .
best guacamole ive ever had for me that alone is grounds for a 5star review add in amazing margaritas strawberry w vanilla infused tequila mmm and delicious enchiladas verdes and im set totally made up for the 1 hour wait on a wednesday night .
got the french toast covered in cornflakes with bananas in the middle seemed promising but unfortunately flavorless the cornflakes take away the flavor of the toast and made it bland the theresa burger and fries were okay perhaps the panini sandwiches will be good service was good though .
ive been a fan of this cute little spot for some time theres always a wait so either go early or late either way its worth it tasty tacos guac you name it and the price is perfect .
food is good but the young waitress has an attitude what ever you do drink the old coffee because if you say something youll get the check before a refill .
a fun vibrant and busy atmosphere where you get to know the strangers aside you making the food that much more exciting great food real people and awesome margaritas worth the wait .
the food is very good but dont ever get delivery each time we order from here it takes over an hour to get here we are 10 blocks from the restaurant when the food gets here over an hour later something is usually wrong with the order .
the restaurant is small but very nice atmosphere would not recommend for groups larger than 8 food and beverage both very good i only wish the restroom were a bit better lit i would definitely go back .
not that impressed with the food here got the lambbeef gyro the table where we sat had a vent that blew on my food the entire time my gyro got cold before i could finish it .
great little place excellent taco al pastor good drinks reasonable prices .
delivery is not the way to go unless you dont mind getting food different from what you ordered i have ordered the same thing on three different occasions and got three different items details people details and oh yeah the hummus use it to tile your bathroom .
excellent food quick service good atmosphere .
this place has terrible customer service delivery man called me practically screaming to come downstairs to get my delivery he was so rude we cancelled the delivery dont order from here .
food is amazing staff is great i love this place .
gyro was good fries cold spinach warm sent them back cook microwaved them fries now soggy spinach boiling hot one star for the greek lady space is well lit and nice but one star or less for customer service youre no ladyjust another brazen hussy .
i cant vouch for the food but the atmosphere and drinks were great if you like heat i recommend the habanero infused tequila i also recommend the grapefruit margarita .
hey greek lady whatever nasty substance you use to cook your home fries in stop using it .
i dont even want to talk about how good this is i dont want you to go in fact dont .
i went here for breakfast and it was fine my greek omelette was a little greasy as were my potatoes the whole wheat toast probably came from a bagged bread full if preservatives it was a good price and convenient but ive definitely had better .
i love this place only wish they would either take reservations or expand alas if it were bigger it wouldnt be so swell so take reservations .
its soso its odd ordering and taking a big number to sit on my table the gyro plate is average the meat was what you would expect fast food style its pretty reasonably priced but the staff is sort of in their own world .
love this place best guacamole ive had in the city the carnitas tacos with pineapple are so yummy its very lively and though small and quaint you definitely feel a great ambience here everyone from the host to the bartender was very attentive and welcoming .
i would normally give this place 5 stars but was just told they no longer make off menu items like gyro meat in omelets wtf its a greek restaurant what poor business insight hell thats lack of insight totally disgusted .
love this place tuna was amazing the price is right .
after hearing folks rave about it for months i tried this place today it was ok not a bad pita but nothing to write home about nice looking place with ok prices but there is better about .
bomb guacamole tiny spot which gets crowded quickly but the competent friendly staff keeps it together and the big open windows give it an airynot claustrophobic vibe reasonable prices for the neighb spicy jalapeno lime margarita seals the deal check .
had a chicken cheese steak that was mediocre at best the honey mustard they have has too much mayo in it and it is not good .
late night mexican food at its finest my hibiscus margarita was yummy so was my spicy chorizo quesadilla i will definitely come back here on a regular basis service a .
awful place mgmt is the worst food isnt great completely over rated plenty of better places in gbury than this spot .
cool spot i am hooked on the jalapeno margarita and nachos check it out it is hard to find a spot in this small spot .
pitiful getting far too big for its own britches cover after midnight for a dj ridiculous this place has always thought its waaaaay better than it is mix of drunk eastern european mobsters in track suits hipsters and cougars wow glastonbury has come a long way not .
while the tacos are pretty average the sopa azteca guacamole and specialty cocktails are fantastic its been my favorite spot to eat and watch the world cup earlier breakfast hours but getting a table in the afternoonevening can be really tough i also recommend the brunch menu .
dont waste your money go downstairs to plan b or across the street to hanafins their atmosphere is way better and a lot cheaper 25 neat glass of jameson thats ridiculous i was not impressed and wont be returning .
great place for a group if you have 8 you can reserve one of the tables casual mexican .
i was very disappointed with the service and would not go back we waited 45 mins for our appetizers and another 30 for our entrees i think the food is overpriced for what you get .
cute delicious never had anything here that was anything but amazing the hot margaritas are in fact hot so watch out also the mole sauce is so good i walked there in basically a blizzard a couple weeks ago totally worth it .
awful third ring of hell kind of awful .
i love everything about this restaurant the enchiladas verdes is one of the best mexican dishes ive had the margaritas are fabulous and the vibe is downtown chill its often pretty hard to get a table but that makes it all the more special .
good atmosphere nice place to have a drink outside in the evening however parking is impossible waitstaff was rude a little courtesy would go along way .
i cant say enough about this place as a mexican girl from cali this place as good as it gets for real mexican food in nyc i love the food here .
cold overly doughy and just all around disappointing glad the prices were reasonable so i didnt waste my money on this place i will however never get that 4 back .
spicy grapefuit margarita i love you .
bad dumpling house ever try sour spicy soup tasted just like soy with spicy also too salted dumpling over cooked services bad they just want you to make purchase unhappy experience to this place .
best fish tacos ever be sure to ask for salsa missing a star for the steep prices three tiny tacos for 9 .
super cheap super quick super salty dramatically salty absurdly salty profoundly salty .
what better way to start the night off than with fresh grapefruit margaritas and chips with guacamole and spicy salsa by seven oclock this tiny les den will be at capacity so do like we unknowingly did the other night and arrive fifteen minutes prior .
msg laden super affordable not very authentic flavors its close to work and thats the reason for a star .
they serve the best fish tacos ive ever eaten and make a great margarita bonus when theres a wait the host will take down your phone number and call you when your table is ready so that you can go grab a drink around the corner .
i had the boiled vegetarian dumplings which were bland and much too doughy there were a few other vegetarian options including the vegetable pancake and peanut noodles that i didnt try .
yummy drinks and food nothing else to say except the wait can be a little long at times but i guess thats because the drinks and food are so yummy .
cabbage and pork dumplings were greasy and cold had to use imagination to believe there was any pork in the greasy pork wonton soup the chicken mushroom and cabbage dumplings were pretty good but not good enough to make me want to come back .
went there for late night drinks great music lovely seating and ambiance and drinks that are not overpriced it wins .
tasty greasy and they charged for stuff that was then left out of my order might repeat .
barrio chino is so warm and intimate it makes you feel sheltered we made a stop there on the way home last night and had margaritas and a lush bowl of guacamole at the bar well be back soon for dinner .
what is the big deal here i got some mushy yet greasy dumplings i watched the chef touch them with his hands when he out them in the carton and i felt ill after i ate them i wont be going back .
went there for dinner on a weeknight around 8 and surprisingly got a table fairly quickly the enchiladas verdes were incredible and actually quite a bit of food for the price the guacamole was delicious as well .
too much grease and overwhelming taste of cheap pork in all their dumpling honestly dont know what the high reviews are about .
spicy grapefruit margaritas are my happy hour favorite goes well with the steak sandwich i live down the street and am always grateful if theres a spot open .
eek dont go out of your way for this one the menu is very similar to the cheap dumpling spots in chinatown that i love and often survive off of but the quality cleanliness service and overall execution is disturbingly awry .
so freakin cute but make sure to make a reservation before you go the soup and the pollo tacos are so good .
nice experience but the food was not very impressive the pallaela my friend ordered was okay my steak was awful .
i love this place great vibe wonderful caipiranias and amazing food the calamari tacos are fabulous and the guacamole is some of the best in nyc .
meh the one vegetarian option was not good the calamari was also not very good .
definitely worth going to very good food but the drinks are overpriced go anyway you will like it .
overpriced sandwich oyster po boy had 3 oysters in it on a large hoagie disappointed to say the least .
one of my fav neighborhood haunts everything on the menu is great first timers should try enchiladas verdes and wash down with margarita or caipirinha no reservations and its always packed suggest getting there early bf 730 .
pros friendly attentive staff cons no more happy hour special cash only byob bottom line you can do better without walkingdriving too far .
its really good place to chill when its not so busy i had a lovely birthday brunch here the only downside was it was a bit crammed for a group of 14 you must order a churro and is pure decadent .
we recently went and the pizza has taken a turn for the worse much better option is dough up bloomfield avenue .
this place is great in every way id go on but i dont have the energy to write out everything that rocks about this spot .
nice looking place with that said the service was very poor waited 15 for the waiter to bring wine glass when done with our salads the plates remain on our table till we ask for a check .
the tacos are delicious affordable and delicious the steak tacos tender strips of beef a taste of cilantro and a generous helping of sliced avocado are fantastic the atmosphere is very les crowded with hipsters and beautiful people not my cup of tea but your results may vary .
too much sauce on the pizza the cheese wasnt fully melted and the crust was soggy theres a better pizza option not too far away .
my favorite mexican in nyc delicious drinks .
i have been to ah pizz many times and always had a great mealexperience but yesterday changed my mind food was not memorable and the service sucked i wont be returning after yesterdays visit .
yummy food steak salads guac and the fresh strawberry and crepe desert relaxed communal atmosphere not for those that dont mind bumping into your neighbor and fresh tasty drinks make for a happy night out .
good food too expensive not worth the .
check plus for awesome mole sauce diverse and exciting drink options written on cardboard menu cute cozy atmosphere with fun vibe check almost minus for long wait getting rushed away from the table to make room for next group slightly acidic guac extremely strong caipirinha pricey .
must have had an off day on sunday could not execute simple request when pizza arrived cold they argued that it wasnt i left will not return .
great authentic food but the wait was ridic .
food is good i like te rice balls as an appetizer the pizza is really good however the service not so much the wait staff all stand around the front door and gossip you always feel like all eyes are on you wont be back anytime soon .
amazing black plum margarhitas the enchiladas verdes were also very tasty crowded and small but the place has a good vibe i remember it being a bit pricey though .
went again flavors still tehre but pizza was cold makes no sense considering comes out of 900 degree oven i was pissed .
very cute place i will definitely go back for their amazing drinks my suggestion is to get a bunch of appetizers and skip the mains .
the good nice fresh salads great goat cheese fritters the bad pizza was cold service was neglectful and unprofessional food was extremely overpriced not worth the money or a second try .
yummy food good prices cozy atmosphere i especially like the ceviche and the enchiladas de mole .
the pizza was wet expensive and long to come the waiter was hard to find and then did not want to hear that we did not like the pizza the owners were nice but should watch the waiters in the back room i will not be back .
barrio chino is awesome because tasty cheap mexican food excellent drinks my fave is the fresh grapefruit margarita amazing guacamole spicy salsa and chips great tacos and shrimp dishes beautiful waitress and cool bartender cool vibe .
i dont understand the wow factor to me it was just ok nothing to write home about i love the oven they use but the flavor was lacking that flavor just a very small selection of pizza only pizza or flatbread i would skip this place sorry .
amazing food drinks .
do not order the arroz con pollo or paella bland and served at room temperature .
i am always down for great mexican food and i have found another great find in ny great margaritas i got the strawberry vanilla margarita yummy guacamole and the drunken shrimp dish is so delicious its crowded but the food and drinks are definitely worth it .
if you like bad service come here well maybe it is more like no service and being ignored .
i love this place mojitos are awesome so are the margaritas theyve got an interesting variety i never ever thought id like mexicanlatin style food in new york but whaddya know apparently this is also a favorite of the coppola daughter .
the food is surprisingly better than expected here however the service needs to be improved every single time i go and sit outside they basically forget about you food is one thing but if the service isnt good forget it .
mexican food with chinese ambiance love this place small intimate seating great ambiance dark really good food friendly service long wait if you get there too late and known for phenomenal jalapeno margaritas order one .
not impressed veggie burger was mostly breading and my fries were burnt my husband described his huevos rancheros as weird would not come back for food yuck .
this place is great nice simple decor exposed brick walls cool wooden bar excellent grapefruit margaritas i could drink those all night unfortunately i wasnt hungry but had the guacamole which was excellent and the ceviche was quite good as well .
mediocre food better atmosphere since renovation but still doesnt know what kind of bar it really is real closing time is 130am not 2am they wont let you in .
no matter what you order the food is great ive tried many sandwiches and have not been disappointed as mentioned before by another user the bread can be kind of hard on the teeth otherwise it is a goto sandwich stop for the area .
fish and chips are mush sorry to be so blatant but they do not care about food they care only about serving alcohol they would not give me water .
had a eggplant fresh mozz roasted pepper and a slice of proscuitto on a roll they definitely have some of the best italian cold cuts in the area .
dont eat here you will get sick try talking to the manager and youll get nowhere .
best deli in montclair yummmm .
ive walked past misconduct many times on my way to and from the patco and always thought hey i should stop in there sometime well sometime came and i was unimpressed looks like ill keep walking on by .
i feel ashamed for the fact i have not left a review for belgiovines before if you find yourself in montclair and you are hungry head here you wont regret it .
service great beer list impressive food flatout dont put macncheese on a menu if i can get it better for 12 the price at the grocery store go for beers with acquaintancesbeer list is nice and bar snacks okay but i wouldnt bring a date or family .
delicious sandwiches and prepared food love the mka special and the homemade cavatelli with broccoli .
meh fall cosmos on the menu but they dont seem to have them beer seems a bit pricey i wouldnt refuse to go here but i wouldnt suggest it .
this is one of the best italian delis around the finest quality meats great service and superb selection as good as it gets a .
bland food overpriced ridiculously slow service too dark for the day time thats it .
ordered the masterpiece sandwich and it was on point next time i will try the same sandwich but with fried eggplant rather then have it grilled super clean and professional establishment with authentic italian products .
pros nice scenery food is decent cons have to wait for a table waiters dont speak good english overall it looks better from the outside and is overpriced for what it is .
awesome sandwiches fresh great quality and so yummy .
in my opinion this place is one of the worst sushijapanese experience of my life its not a place where i would visit again surprisingly though it was packed when we dined last night sorry its just 2 s for you .
my go to sandwich place in montclair they even make their own mozzarella an old school italian deli that is a mustvisit .
they dont take reservation on lunch time we walked in they tell us its gonna take an hour therefore we say in there for 45 minutes then they tell us we may not make it cool staff you have there .
the sandwich shop in montclair huge sandwiches which are delicious and even when theyre busy they give great service they also have a great selection of pastas and italian specialties to cook at home highly recommended .
nothing about the food is special none of the dishes are memorable i guess maybe it attracts people for the cheaper prices i do not understand the hype at all .
absolutely great sandwiches and tons of other prepared foods and italian specialties that are delicious my only suggestion would be that they change their bread preferably to nicolos then it would be 5 stars .
horrible food what a disappointment frozen food just microwaved would not go to this place again .
prosciutto and mozzarella are the best i have ever had fast service delicious almost buttery cheese and meats and reasonable prices make this my favorite place for a good sandwich .
i called ahead for a 9pm reservation upon arriving i was somewhat apprehensive to eat here because of the b health department grade but that didnt matter since they no longer had my reservation i do not recommend this place .
best italian sub ive ever had whenever ive been out of town for a while one of my first stops when back is belgiovines for a super combo with hot peppers also great for handmade pasta and entrees seriously great stuff .
horrible service i was treated like shit im never going back and wouldnt recommend it food is not even that nice .
great italian themed sandwiches very good quality and flavor meatballs and chicken cutlets are good nice italian deli antipasti little market with specialty italian stuff and frozen italian meals and pasta too .
it was fine nothing amazing service was good and the food was pretty good just not the usual sushi i was expecting and it was very rice heavy .
its all covered in other reviews fantastic sandwiches and irresistible home made and branded products great bunch behind the counter you must try the place .
mcdonalds here sucks the manager looks disheveled the staff members are rude a bacon clubhouse meal will cost you 10 10 do yourself a favor and exit into a local mcdo and save yourself a couple of bucks .
best deli around love the fresh mozzarella love the service love the prepared foods .
standard .
if you are a chicken and you die to become a cutlet from belgiovine your death is honored respected and you served a purpose in life seriously a chicken cutlet sandwich from this place with fresh mozzarella cheese is heavenly service was very friendly too .
well located for a service plaza right off the road .
i purchased pumpkin ravioli for a dinner party holy smoke it was just the best ravioli ive ever tasted stuffed really full of a lucious filling and the pasta was nutmeg flavored it doesnt get much bettter than this .
is it possible for a restaurant to be both soulless and good i didnt think so either zinc is the culinary equivalent of kelly clarkson .
we stop in here for their fresh and frozen pastas great stuff at great prices lots of variety cant be beat .
this place is so overpriced i ordered scallop with risotto and the risotto tasted aweful even though i told the waiter but he didnt changed the dish and said they were out of food lame stupid excuse absolutely disappointed .
nice clean polite reasonably priced the pizza was great we also had the philly roll which was really good enjoyed .
first time last time at zinc food ok didnt need the wine lesson from the 20 something year old arrogant owner ill be sure to share this with my colleagues downtown thumbs down .
weve been coming here for 6 years 5 stars for great customer service reasonable price a great selection of pizzas pastas get a white slice sprinkle some crushed peppers and ask no questions .
yuck not yuck as in bad but yuck as in this is what i eat at home when i feel very lazy i e paying for this kind of food is retarded .
great deals and delivery is fast the delivery guy was cute too .
wouldnt recommend this restaurant to anyone food overpriced for the quality .
great wraps fries and soups everyday there are specials happy with the service and nyc deli feel .
i had some pretty bad fried rice and pie here the restaurant was beautiful great service i just wish the food was better .
good honest place the staff was friendly and helpful the 2 dishes that my wife and i were very tasty and reasonably priced .
taste was not well balanced and the fried spinach was extremely oily it was overpriced mediocre food .
incredible great value and quality the chicken is made with real chicken same w all the meat great ingredients make great food and this place does just that .
really didnt like this place i got this funky risotto that was actually inedible and i eat everything for a price like this you can go to a much better restaurant in new haven .
i love their food anytime i have to stay late in the office or work over the weekends i would definitely order here the price is right the foodd is quality and delivery is fast im glad i found another chinese restaurant away from home that i enjoy .
overpriced scallops underdone presented swimming in huge amounts of sauce which also overwhelmed the accompanying risotto a remarkably poor showing add to this the rushed and perfunctory service and i would suggest giving zinc a miss .
came here for my engagement dinner with family and ate outside the servers are just magnificent and the food is perfection one of the if not the best restaurant ive been too helped me appreciate quality food and an experience when eating out .
had some selections from the menu special the soup was fine but the stir fried shrimp and rice had a sauce that was too strong and seemed to spoil it dessert pumkin parfait was good although the green apples were just a bit to sour for me .
every time we go it gets better if thats possible the food the service the place is spectacular we wood put this up against any fine restaurant in nyc .
dont go here for restaurant week at least i got the jumbo shrimp fried rice the rice was too fried and the jumbo shrimp was far far from jumbo the dessert was good though pumpkin parfait the atmosphere was nice but only coupled with a mediocre meal .
superb very fun very attentive staff a 5 star experience in every way the desserts are to die for .
so many great places in the ironbond to eat this is not one of them .
10 stars absolutely amazing a place to come back all menu items were exceptional very knowledgeable personal and warming i strongly recommend you to visit this place .
food was not that great ordered the oxtail and chicken and both were very mediocre at best .
amazing service amazing food amazing experience yes portions are extremely small but the taste is incredible totally worth it i will definitely be back .
waste your money here its inexpensive but barely edible inattentive service coupled with chewy ribs and last weeks produce .
best food best ambiance best service reservation is a must a great place for a romantic dinner no private parking but its easy to find a public parking spot will go back .
rice was mushy soup was decent empanadas were mediocre waitstaff was indifferent .
spectacular food wonderful service a great place for a special dinner be sure to make reservations .
theres better options .
my girlfriend took me here for my birthday just awesome service from the enterance to the table food one word yuummmy inside wine store is excellent place to get educated on wine selections .
i loved this place because i love me some kabobs but then a distressing thing happened a couple years ago this place got one of the lowest scores of any restaurant in burlington by the board of health and i got scared .
wonderful night last night celebrating my 25th anniversary it was the best meal i have ever eaten the staff was great we ate in the garden romantic but not stuffy i highly recommend cafe matisse .
ordered a skirt steak sandwich was cold as hell not sure why im not talking lukewarm because i walked across the street to eat in class it is refrigerator cold next time ill walk over to the cambodian truck at least he serves food hot .
food is amazing service is simply outstanding dining experience you cannot be disappointed here .
if overcooked overpriced food is appealing to you this place is for you very small portions for the money and many items look like they were sitting out a very long time ive tried lunch here twice and am unimpressed to say the least .
went here twice both times i was happy w the service food its a nice intimate place for a date the waiters were helpful in helping us w suggestions food is rich w lots of flavors would def come back again .
was here on a weekday morning its attractive and has an attractive clientele my scrambled eggs were chewy and overdone the turkey sausage was like a hockey puck and was served only slightly above room temperature the coffee was ok .
the best french restaurant in nj period amazing wait staff who are all very knowledgeable in the food they are serving great wine store next door byob and the owner is always welcoming you once you open the door great selection of foods and a prixe fixe .
we tried the chinese and thai we where not satisfied with the food but the service is excellent and i would go back again just to try sushi in their sushi bar .
one of mine and husbands absolute favorite restaurants the food is just as amazing as the service when the weather is warm you can sit in their gorgeous outdoor garden truly an outstanding place cant wait for our next date night here .
okay food pizza was bland service was good nice ambiance bathrooms need to be renovated i thought the prices were way too high for what was offered .
i have been going to cafe matisse since i was a little kid and it just keeps getting better larry always makes us feel like family and steven is the best peter loria is a true artist no one in nj is doing anything like matisse .
looking to spend too much money on low quality food and poor service look no further max amore is here to help .
best restaurant in nj .
mediocre food pasta dish we had for dinner was virtually tasteless better place to go for lunch salads are good we also had a stone pie the crust was good but thats about it was weighed down with stewed tomatoes wouldnt eat dinner here again .
anyone that ask me to recommend a restaurant for a special occassion cafe matisse is always on top list wonderful attentive staff terrific decor must sit outside in the summer and the food is top notch .
absolutely horrible from start to finish worst dinning experience in ct service was rude food was under cooked management is not accommodating at all save the trip and go somewhere else did i mention pricey they need to get a clue from surrounding resturants .
wowie great place very but actually worth it the atmosphere is whimsical and romantic if you go here definitely make the burger one of your choices because it rocked the best way to describe the food is bursting with intense flavor you will not leave unsatisfied .
over all disappointed since i anticipated trying this place out its a gamble you may enjoy it not a place i would try again .
outstanding little gem with small dining room and fabulous nyc quality dishes the tasting menu was fantastic with just the right amount of food to leave you full as a byo the next door wine store is very convenient .
ordered french toast eggs benedict and english muffin sandwich all are okquality but considering the price expensive and quantity i can give only two stars .
one of our favorite restaurants in nj food is sometimes a bit ostentatious but overall experience and taste is rewarding .
crazy overpriced for tinyyyy dinner portions i dont even eat that much food but this was sad i think the veal was 6 thin seethrough deli slices of lamb over some greens we had to go to another food location to fill up .
foodies rejoice if you havent tried this place youre missing out its cozy romantic and the food is unique call weeks in advance for a reservation and be prepared to pay more than 200 per couple well worth it mj .
been here twice the foodservice at this place is not something i would write home about no plans of going back again .
so enchanting food is yummy and very attentive staff .
this is a pretty nice space but the food was not up to par the pasta was undercooked the cheese plate was uninteresting and the best thing about the recommended swordfish appetizer was the sauce .
what an experience a must for anyone who loves the art of food .
i have always loved this place until tonight horrible service drinks not available pasta just soso extremely long wait for dessert i probably wont go back .
outstanding one of my all time favorites service ambiance and food is amazing great place for a special occassion byob .
a bysmal small place but def kitchy nice bar scene with good looking people service was a bit weak and the food was subpar very salty and uninspired would maybe come back for a drink only .
love the place excellent food great selection of wines and superb service i will go back for more .
its a shame food was decent hostess was extremely pretentious for such a small restaurant its amazing how long things take to get to you wouldnt recommend or go back .
where do i even begin the best hole in the wall restaurant always get a bocadillo what this place is known for if you feeling antibocadillo the entrées are a great option as well love love love this place .
not thrilled with the food or the waitstaff .
empanadas out of this world grilled shrimp salad juicy great cuban place and homey if youre around the area a regular now .
the food is average and overpriced same with the cocktails the service is poor unsure why some people like this place we will not be back .
holy crap mind blown everything i had was spot on must try this place .
the food was good the portions were small i had two entrees and dessert and left hungry all for 100 bucks .
very good restaurant a personal favorite for me and my girl good food good ambiance .
tried this place a few times and was never impressed this last time made me wanting to write a review service is unprofessional and super slow pizza is salty and has no flavor tiramisu looks like a pile of shit very unappetizing .
good cuban food in the area place is just a bit too small easily gets packed .
i had big expectations of this place however the seafood pasta i ordered was very plain very pasta on one side and seafood in the other the dish was not coherent .
best cuban restaurant i have ever been to in 2 years food mojitos were fresh and delicious cant wait to go back .
the floors are dingy and they have a balsamic vinegar sauce theyre very proud of threestar pizza everything else worse .
not too expensive amazing cubano sandwich and very friendly staff plantains were great too .
this place sucks they pride themselves on pizza the pizza is nothing great and very overpriced i love nutella so i got the nutella pizza and that sucked too i ended up just licking off the nutella not worth the long wait at all .
just get the pork shoulder please trust me on this drinks are high alcohol and good services is great guacamole was very good simple authentic food .
our waitress was wonderful but the lack of ac in the dining room made dining at this café a terrible experience the food was mediocre and the wait long as well .
great food .
came here for breakfast even though the restaurant was empty still had to wait over 50 minutes to get served i finished my coffee as it was going service isnt that great .
great brunch deal for 10 95 u have a choice from about 12 entrees and 3 drink choices low noise level and atmosphere is very cozy make sure they cook your eggs though mine were way undercooked .
very popular restaurant in princeton reservation is not accepted service is not good and not attentive and as the matter of fact quite slow food is decent but it does not justify the cost i really think it is overrated .
great food at very decent prices always goes here when im in nyc this is the cafecito mojito .
food is good but the service is crap .
location is not the most convenient but still deserves 5 stars because they have the best cuban food in nyc you have to try pollo empanizado .
nice servers but painfully slow food is good but relatively overpriced for the area .
great cuban food new favorite place for cuban sandwiches are amazing plantain apps are perfect with green and red hot sauce go here and get some spicy food to sweat our your hangover .
dinner monday night ive had better pizza the menu is very limited and only after ordering i found out that i could custom order a pizza the service was good but overall it was a little over priced .
solid food had cafe com leche maduros skirt steak good atmosphere .
bad lasagna today dry almost burnt just not up to their usual standards susans penne arrabiata wasnt as good as usual either but she was more satisfied than i was with my vastly overcooked lasagna .
mojitos are the best here .
long waits at lunch slowest service ive had in my life been here 1 hr still no food food was tasty nothing special .
one of the best churrascos in town and for that price hello great atmosphere and love the live music on some nights weekends could be a long wait but the yummy food is definitely worth it the sangria and mojitos are my drink of choice here .
ive eaten here twice while passing through princeton and dont really understand the raves food was ok but not great im not planning on a return visit .
came here for dinner with my friends on a saturday night we waited for about 30mins for a table i had the chilean sea bass which was the special of the night and it was so juicy and tender go try it out .
i truly wish they could keep a rating very scared to eat at a sushi restaurant that cant maintain that .
best cuban ive found in nyc i no longer miss living in south florida .
bad although the sushi was ok the salmon that i ordered was like jerky and the shrimp dish my wife ordered was over cooked and chewy when we told staff she just said oh ok no offer to correct stay away from there .
nearly as good as mamas cooking love the vaca frita and the moros here .
overpriced mediocre sushi in staten island .
the food and desert were fantastic the flavors were really special and the portions were generous and just right the server was friendly too .
this place has many wires crossed my friends rehearsal dinner was planned for an evening but the manager seemed to think that it was cancelled wouldnt most places call the hosts to confirm luckily the farmhouse was extremely accommodating and in all likelihood better .
i was in the neighborhood looking for a good restaurant with low expectations but i was happily surprised amazing camarones al ajillo .
bland food slow service thought i would give it a second chance but it is not worth it .
fried chip plantain w the garlicky sauce thats the jam ceviche was meh too watery ropa vieja is good almost panini like crispy flat good and the churrasco was good .
not worth the hype honestly cant understand why it always so busy if your looking for great breakfast the affordable go to henrys or pennycluse .
good good food the chicken fricassee is a great plate .
food is edible but uninspired the managers seem hapless this place does not compete with other popular breakfast lunch places in burlington like penny cluse and mirabels im a local and i avoid this place because of its reputation as just not that great .
really great seabass special of the day but definitely recommend requesting the chimichurri sauce on the side to pair .
i have given theses guys far too many chances between poor service rotten meat and under cooked pancakes im done .
this place was first recommend to me by a bunch of cuban friends of mine from miami very authentic cuban food and super cheap the breaded steak is overindulgence at its finest .
food is way overpriced go to mcdonalds before coming here much better food for a lower price service is also incredibly slow for not being that busy so if you want an interminable wait for the privilege of paying 12 bucks for a burger this is the place .
nice lighting very cozy spot quick and genuinely nice service had the camarones enchilados with a strawberry margarita and it was awesome well made drinks lastly left a 21 tip .
corn in a shepards pie says it all nice effort but far from authentic irish food .
great happy hour customer service i like the atmosphere no fuss laid back their food is good too solid cuban order the churrasco .
its 10pm on a sat night and its turned into club hoboken theres guys walking around in security shirts with armbands and someone else counting people i find it hard to believe that a pub in ireland works this way .
wonderful coffee friendly staff i will return .
nice atmosphere but not worth the money for what your getting .
delicious cuban food try their garlic dipping sauce with literally anything they have vampires would eat this stuff .
if you want to be able to speak to the person across from you dont go here im 26 .
i live down the street from this place and it is great good food and great service .
we had a few complaints the service was incredibly slow crudo was room temp grilled octopus was cold main dish was just ok legal sea foods is better also fin is a byob we wont be going back .
delicious food and great service at a reasonable price easy to get a table very laid back and casual atmosphere shared the churasco which was awesome and fricasse de pollo which was a good chicken dish but not as tasty as the churasco definitely worth checking out .
overpriced and the fish especially bronzino and lobster sliders were terrible definitely a no no .
best cuban food in the city if you love cubanlatin food this is the place to go i ate brunch there it was very tasty and well seasoned for brunch i got the skirt steak i am looking forward to go to dinner there .
thursday night food good noise deafening .
awesome little spot i like the bar decor friendly staff drinks food good atmosphere oh and to finish up the scene love the bollitos and for any colombians you know the actual translation to bollitos haa try this place once and you will be back .
this place is horrible point blank end of story the food was so bad i couldnt finish it and the service just as bad .
skirt steak was perfect good rice and tasty beans very good service would return and try other dishes .
the electronics are balky card readers on ipads dont function well repeated entries time consuming technology for blah overpriced food awaiting a true upgrade for ewr dining yet to be seen .
this is hands down the best cuban food ive had in nyc having lived my entire life in miami i have been on a search to find good cuban food everywhere and i finally did delicious .
one of the strangest dinning concepts ive ever seen bolt an ipad to the table so that there isnt room for the plate and force you to tip when you order food was good but the service and experience left much to be desired .
great food great desert great drinks all at a decent cost loved the music and setting of the place and if you checkin via your phone through the yelp app you get a free drink wany meal monthurs cant complain ill be back .
yes this may be my first one star sat down and was ignored they have an ipad ordering system i couldnt work no one is interested to be avoided .
the food is always delicious my favorites are saborcito de cuba a variety of appetizers churrasco the steak with chimichurri is excellent camarones al ajillo shrimp with garlic sauce is yummy everytime i eat there it brings me back to ibagué tolima colombia colombia como te extraño .
i only reason why i gave it 2 stars is that the service was good but the food was not so good i will not be going back .
great food especially the pork shank and the calamari best experienced in summer when the windows are open and the street is a bit more alive .
ate here twice forced to get delivery once always lackluster pale unappetising food unfriendly management staff overpriced breakfast sandwiches bacon egg cheese on a bagel 8 dollars yeah right hoping that i wont be forced to return .
excellent best vaca fritas ive had outside of miami .
commented about how warm it was to waiter and hostess hot day entry ac on full blast they couldnt care less weak powdered tea soggy panini too bad its attractive inside more comfortable booths than when it was the clairmont wont go back .
good .
a nice place for a casual brunch nice parmesan biscuits with sausage gravy and the french toast which i thought was delicious unfortunately it was uncomfortably warm inside the place even though we were sitting away from the open kitchen .
holy cow the flank steak is amazing also unbelievable tostones and maduros super fast service too the tres leche cake was average though .
the place was very very loud definitely not intimate for a date night the portion size was inadequate .
kind of cramped but we were happy overall with our meal its been a couple of months and i havent felt any strong urges to return but i might remember it if i was in the neighborhood .
good service and nice space but seriously small portions be prepared to drop around 150 for 2 people and still feel a little hungry entrees were appetizer size food was nothing special wont be back .
we came here with a group of 7 that expanded to a group of 8 they set up a great table for us were so accommodating and nice service was just the right pace perfect for the getting together with a group of friends without breaking the bank .
smelled bad in here small portions my steak was way too charred and had an offputting gray color to it husbands pasta special was mediocre my drink was ridiculously strong and wasnt filled to the top major peeve lone bright spot was olive oil cake .
delicious and inexpensive food weak drinks nice ambiance and friendly service will definitely be back and stick to beer instead .
not bad just uneven on three visits it was all over the place some excellent crudo some eh same goes for pasta .
i grew up eating cuban food and the picadillo at this place blows away all of the home made stuff ive had it doesnt get better than this best picadillo ive ever had .
while the food is always delicious the service is abhorrent rudest staff ever complete absence of costumer service humanity or class the only reason they are in business is because the clientele has no where else to go .
delicious neighborhood spot yummy food great prices good drinks .
good deals but so freaking loud im not a bitch and i enjoy loud music but damn dude and its all metal i live real close and was happy it opened but man its loud so loud it distorts and stresses their speakers damn .
good authentic cuban food and drinks the waitress accidentally spilled water on my friend but he was asking for it .
reservation was pointless our group still had to wait at the bar a tiny table right next to the kitchen for over 30 minutes food was ok small place .
ive been here a few times the food has always been excellent every single bite from the main to the side dish is savory wellpriced cozy atmosphere .
wine was stale tasted like it was opened 2 weeks ago food was so average service terrible server poured water in husbands beer glass granted it wasnt well lit and easy to confuse the two glasses not wasting my money there again .
i love this place you really cant go wrong here ive tried probably half the menu last time i had the crispy flank steak dlicious portions are large and in charge drinks are good as well service has been consistently decent definitely worth checking out .
not good overpriced our food was burned not sure whos writing these reviews our if we were just there on an off night but i wouldnt go back there are lots and lots of better places to eat disappointing .
great little awesome cubano place to go with friends music pretty tasty mojitos awesome .
like the concept but the food doesnt taste very good especially with the high prices also the seating arrangements are too crowded for comfort lastly a simple request like splitting the tab between two credit cards resulted in one card being charged twice .
cuban sandwiches plantain chips tres leche cake with pineapple salsa decently priced cute girl behind the counter yay .
an overly pompous server did not compensate for slowly served expensive mediocrity what a disappointment service was attentive and excellent food was very mediocre almost bland kitchen and courses were slow epic fail .
outstanding cuban sandwich service was fast and efficient id say the total time it took from placing the order to go to walking out with the sandwich in my hands was 8 minutes .
tried twice once for sunday brunch once for friday dinner unimpressed will not go back overpriced and underwhelming left regretful of decision to eat there .
the mojito was great service friendly windows open to a nice evening food was plentify and delicious bring cash ugh churrasco was outstanding my breaded steak was fairly good good rice and beans will be back for happy hour and future food .
i had their 65 special salad pasta entree and dessert i didnt like anything .
great cuban food my spot to get a mojito and espresso before my boy byron at abstract black nyc lays down some ink on me the empanadas are bangin love this place prices are great when they have happy hour .
overated way expensive snotty waitstaff food not that great .
great value great cuban food great drinks too i recommend the churrasco if its your first time going but dont be afraid everything here is very good and authentic and i love the cuban music sometimes live .
i went there just to check out the place hate it the staff was bored and one of the owners looked as if she sucked lemons for a living dont go there its just not worth it .
i love this place for take out the food is absolutely delicious the restaurant is nice albeit crowded and loud .
has anyone had a good meal here we just moved into the neighborhood so i thought id give this place one more try i had brunch with raw black beans in my huevos rancheros the coffee was great but that was about as good as it got .
can i get an order of your chicken soup and a cubano delivered to iowa asap .
mediocre italian food in a ridiculously cramped setting poor service overpriced for what they serve .
i really the the ambiance great churrasco vaca frita their mojito is pretty good too .
no stars one of the most overrated new hipster spots in montclair .
good food good service yummy environment i just wish i didnt have to walk so far to the east side but its probably better for my digestion since i eat everything in sight there best cafe con leche in the worlddd .
i visited this local place three times and each visit was underwhelming .
great cuban restaurant very good food especially their empanadas and the chocolate cake .
while i am not a fan several of my friends are for me the food is too briny .
great food one of my favorite places in the les its a little cramped but nothing out of the ordinary empanadas are great and the flourless chocolate cake is wroth every bite mojitos used to be fantastic but theyve gone down hill a bit unfortunately .
definitely a localhipster spot 2 miller high life so those looking for a deal the backyard is nice to hang out in during warm weather months but the inside is just a bit too grimey looking for me .
what a fun place with great food love coming to this place everytime im in new york fun vibe and atmosphere with great food and you dont feel like youre stuck in midtown which youre not .
subtracting a star because of other people that ive met whove raved about this place meh just a regular bar with puton charm hipster yuppies in the front and out back .
vaca frita holy mannnnnn good lord everything about this dish was perfect everything i would eat this everyday i love this place i order delivery a lot from here as well one of ave cs little gems .
dirty dive filled with no class hipsters .
yum and fun this little cuban joint is a favorite east village spot among my friends the sangria is sooooo good and the food is so flavorful albeit rich .
coffee has gone really down hill no more no more .
rating is for their mojito only verdict delicious and better than esperanto .
for a regular meal whats up with the pretense and bad service .
i really liked their shrimp skewer salad fresh avocado tasty shrimp garnished with papaya my friends had sandwhiches and were full the rest of the day .
9 for one piece of bread cut in half with some plain avocado smushed on top there are too many good places in brooklyn to bother with this completely mediocre and severely overpriced place .
a terrific hidden spot the mini burgers were the best burgers i have ever had my friend had the steak sandwich it came with potato sticks on them the food was sick the wait staff was very good they kept the pitchers of sangria coming all night .
my friend and i both got a bad case of food poisoning from the baked goods on separate occasions cute place but not coming back .
cafecito is incredibly charming the staff is great and we bring all of our visiting friends there for dinner i think ive had one good meal and the rest have been great pulled chicken and the skirt steak are awesome .
its been around for awhile now and though it is adorable and in a great spot i cant love it why because it disappointed my search for the best oatmeal in the neighborhood the oatmeal was cold gummy lumpy and skimpy .
my boyfriend and i absolutely love it here everytime we go back they make us love it even more service is always phenomenal food is amazing and their bomb bomb lager is pretty great too i recommend bomb bombs to everybody i know .
there are many things i love about iris cafe but charging 3 for an iced coffee is enough to make me take my business elsewhere even in a market of inflated iced coffee prices three bucks is just insulting .
i came for the barbecue and was not disappointed i ordered the bomber and i got a mountain meat huge portions casual atmosphere and extremely friendly local staff make this place a south philly gem eat at babomb .
i had the tasting menu which was disappointing the a la carte dishes looked way better the tasting menu was not so inspired but rather bland cant compare with tocqueville for example would come back but wont have the tasting menu again .
absolutely the best italian food in philly waitress service is great humble home style feeling in here food is great service is awesome desert is amazing rice pudding gotta try it .
service was really slow the food is better at jlob sister res around the corner in the hour we did wait for our food we sampled a couple of plates and nothing blew our tastebuds away i will not be going back was not an enjoyable time .
ya have to go on a sat afternoon real deal cooking very friendly 15 table seating .
meh tiny menu nothing that great ive had better everything on this menu elsewhere they were super nice and the bathrooms were lovely .
been here for a few more dinners since and still as great as ever wednesday night definitely check out their 5 mussel bowls best in the city .
wouldnt recommend this bar to anyone drinks were watered down rude subpar bartender loud obnoxious environment overwhelming smell of air freshener go somewhere else .
dont be fooled but the oldstyle italian feel this place gives off get the ribs theyre ahmazing meaty tender falls off the bone great sauce make sure to get a birch beer with your meal worth every penny .
food was cold and the bartender was very rude and not helpful never again .
spaghetti with crab meat is sooooo good mussel is also great the same lady who works there is always super friendly great spot in south philly to sit and just hang out .
average at best good service but few choices on the menu how can you not offer brunch items on the weekend quality of food meh .
famous for its ribs this joint is my favorite philly dive bar enjoyed a beer and a half rack of baby backs while watching the phillies super friendly place huge portions and great prices beware parking is nonexistent i was lucky finding a spot tonight but not always .
been here twice i want to like it and i cant overpriced bland food i love the other farmhouse restaurants but this would be the last place i would recommend in burlington plan on trying again in a year .
so happy being full and so is the whole family best spaghetti and muscles on earth .
was very disappointed meatballs were hard and pasta sauce not very good great ambience though and had some nice wine .
i enjoy the spicy food and the secret unique flavors really can be difficult to find a seat as the restaurant and bar area is very small worth it if you go .
they closed due to family illness and they moved back to italy sooo sad .
basic south philly food the waitresses are friendly but it gets annoying the way they refer to women as girls oh well i like the food ive eaten in the dining room but prefer the bar very relaxed vibe .
horrible actually almost nonexistent service finally got up and left after not being served despite only a handful of customer in the bar .
fun and kitschy decent food and a cool atmosphere this strikes me as a good destination for a fun date .
awkward set up of the bar drinks were ok food was not so great but then again i cant eat cheese .
wow this place is great the bbq sauce was amazing be warned the servings are very large try the icebox cake my first time and im a fan .
they overcharged us on happy hour then they give us 20 off which is still more than happy hour prices .
so happy we found this great place close to our home friendly warm service and fantastic food with very reasonable prices you have to get the mussels app they were fabulous and a substantial bowl that served as my dinner p s the bombbomb lager is superb .
so disappointed layout is a disaster as is crowdvodka .
love this place great date night joint foods amazing service was great bouncer has such a welcoming smile tall black guy love dark ambiance and crowd is always chill .
the service was okay but combined with the awful food makes this restaurant a place to miss there are too many other good restaurants in the area to even consider a second trip .
the mac and cheese is fab thats all .
this is a great place to wait an hour for your reservation and 15 minutes for the bathroom despite their best efforts the food is agreeable .
lively bar with a dozen beers on tap and great cocktail menu friendly and attentive bartender and great atmosphere food looks tasty but didnt order this time great place to hang out .
very disappointed it looks very inviting from the outside upon coming in prices are also inviting however food lacked taste ive tried three dishes and all were bland i guess you get what you pay for .
i must say this place is awesome form the fried pickles to the atmosphere the descent selection of music not too loud so u can still have a descent convo .
horrible placed a delivery the tacos were terrible only one tortilla it was thick and not heated at all the chicken and al pastor meat were tasteless they were also very rude on the phone not impressed .
yum yummy yumekers love all the time love love love it cant wait to pass by and go and eat amazing how this place got semi famous .
i came here on a rush one day i placed the order over the phone for empanadas they were big greasy i didnt like it at all however it was a quick snack so thats that never again .
we have been here a few times love the beer list good quality craft beers very cool ambiance overall a great place to just hang out the staff has always been very friendly plan on going back soon to try more of the food .
to be completely honest i dont usually write reviews but i feel like smothering a bologna sub in mayo and calling it a italian combo is just ughh had to throw away the meal i just paid for this sucks thumbs down and still hungry ick .
we dont have dessert only booze said our waitress possibly the best reply ill ever get from a waitress fried chicken sandwich was delicious fried cheese curds were a win and their booze list is pretty sweet sweet afton can do no wrong .
i have never had worse pizza in my life ever dont ever order from these guys it would be better to starve .
i love this place i love the dark ambiance their food is excellent fried picklessssss must try those the mac and cheese was great also and everything else we tried nice happy hour also a gem in astoria .
had great expectations from this place after reading the reviews but was disappointed i definitely have eaten better indian food in philly their nonvegetarian dishes were still better than their vegetarian counterparts .
been to this place twice and i really love the interior but the food is excellent loved their burgers which is byfar the best in astoria other foods and drinks going back soon to try different food .
really bad food here portions are extremely small and overpriced the only good thing was these cashew fried things they had good flavor but i would never come back here sorry i will find another indian place .
had the sweet afton burger which was really good dimly lit so its great for dates and hanging out pretty small .
some dishes were okay but not great cheap atmosphere inside mexican waiters bath boys were annoying .
this is a very laid back neighborhood bar good drinks good music good bar food tends to get crowded but not to the point thats offputting definitely would recommend for those looking for a fun lowkey night .
very cramped but thats nyc breakfast was very average nothing to write home about we had the tunisian breakfast it was bland and the chickpeas had no flavor the cake we had tasted stale there are better options .
came for brunch a couple of weekends ago and the food was great the service was a little slow but i guess if youre coming for a leisurely brunch thats okay .
i came here for brunch its in a very quite and cute neighborhood its a great spot for outdoor eating however the food itself is very typical and boring brunch food nothing to write home about or worth going to again .
this place is great if you want to seat enjoy a beer and eat really delicious food of course is noisy and the seating rules are sometimes confusing but who cares when you have an incredible house salad .
not very friendly service and poached egg was overcooked so yolk wasnt runny on the eggs florentine which was disappointing .
i went to sweet afton for both dinner and brunch of course their dinner is awesome with great beer and their brunch is also fantastic one of the best burgers and fries in astoria my fav beer is organic peak .
squid ink tagliolini w clams was so so and the monkfish special of the night was mediocre at best nothing amazing and not quite a bargain i would suggest venturing elsewhere good service nonetheless .
highly recommend the ommegang witte beer very very good belgianstyle wheat ale .
as the amount of stars indicate meh ive experienced better pasta was not cooked al dente and muddied in sauce friend had the raviolis which arrived cold in the center and mushy over all on a positive note the flat bread that came with the table was delicious .
ive only every been on the weekends from what i gather its great place to come with a group of friends to laugh unwind be loud strong drinks cool environment attractive bartenders dig it .
i take 3 stars back calamari appetizer was nothing special and gnocchi was made with the same sauce as ravioli bread was old tsk tsk .
i really liked this place the servers are super attentive and i absolutely loveeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee the ambiance youll love the energy and drinks arent expensive id recommend this to anyone cool spot and awesome staff two thumbs up .
place its okay cash only the big turn off its the waiting time for the crepes to be ready make sure you order the food and desert all together or you will be waiting there for a long long time .
love this place 1star because of the noise level but they have great food drinks and atmosphere also pickle back shots .
small greasy space with very limited seating we went for brunch i got a breakfast crepe egg ham peppers and it was bland and not satisfying at all my fiance ordered a chicken spinach lunch crepe which was decent but probably wont return .
this one of the best bar in astoria the service is very nice and all the staffs are so friendly whenever i go there i always see its crowded which make happy means they are really doing a great job .
meh inside it is small crowded and noisy with a small number of tables crowded together the small staff was friendly but the crepes were just ok our food was served on throwaway plates with plastic utensils ive had better .
love the laid back vibe here food is good although i dont think their fried pickles are the best thing here and they have a decent beer selection just wish it was bigger so i dont have to fight for a seat .
not a sitdown restaurant basically a take out place with ok food i dont understand the 412 stars at all .
hot cider overrated but amazing fries good beers and good fried pickles laid back ambiance definitely a really chill spot .
went for dinner 2 days ago place was empty on a thursday night at 7pm the service was friendly decor was nothing to write about onto the food sushi was average teriyaki chicken was horrible wont be back .
definitely my favorite bar in astoria and one of my favorite bars in new york in general food and drinks are always fantastic as well as the bar service .
food is good when you eat there just dont get delivery was told it would take 35 minutes food arrived 90 minutes later cold and soggy .
cool spot to grab a beer and burger brunch is pretty awesome too funky drink specials and odd pancakes .
soooo homophobic they would not serve my boyfriend an i we were there over an hour and we just got waters i would never recommend this place especially for people that are gay friendly .
just a dam fun clean and happy place great knowledgeable bartenders awesome food and cheap well as compared to soho i just might be in astoria tonight .
the food is exactly what you expect within the price range the bouncer was remarkably bizarrely rude .
i go there once in a while to meet a friend i like the atmosphere and the service is good good beer selection and good prices .
had lunch here the other day dont understand what the fuss is about the wraps dont taste good its clear the ingredient quality is low its not expensive but you get what you pay for in this case .
rustic speakeasylike ambiance lots of wood and dim lighting delicious specialty cocktails fun hipster staff .
a piece of metal in my chicken i called to tell them about it and got hung up on not a fan .
sweet afton is one of the best bars in astoria prices are reasonable and ambience is nice fried pickle is good .
drinks are waaayyyyy overpriced for this dive always empty place .
good happy hour exceptional burger solid fried pickles and solid fries the chicken sandwich is good too but just get the burger .
stopped in here for some coffee looking to try something new we got flavored lattes and they were not good we ended up taking two sips and throwing them in the trash and walking over to starbucks .
solid food great beer selection and creative cocktails this place never disappoints .
decent food decent beer selection poor service service is often slow and wait staff appears to be indifferent potential to be much better .
good drink prices beer of the month was the best beer on tap i hadnt been to williamsburg in a while so i got my hipster fix without having to take a g train kinda crowded but not too crowded people were friendly .
horribly unfriendly service the bouncer was rude and evasive as to why we were denied entry we came in from out of town to celebrate new years eve but had no such luck with this place if i could i would give it zero stars in this review .
great bar great food great service dont miss the pickle back shots or the portobello burger here off the hook but avoid friday and saturday too crowded enjoy .
this place blows our drinks had almost no alcohol in them we had about 4 rounds of shots in less than half an hour and walked out feeling nothing this place basically scams you out of your money .
a real gem love that the food is locally sourced and the ingredients are of such a high quality the staff is delightful and the beer selection is great love the portobello sandwich .
ok good beer very very slow .
this place is awesome the burgers was good the ambiance is dim and lots of wood which i like would go back again .
do not go here not worth the money 9 50 for a well drink everywhere else on the strip was half the price .
brooklynesque hipster joint in astoria good brunch burger good bloody maries id def go back .
this is the bar you go to if you are over thirty and trying to recapture your college days not a pretty sight .
im a mac and cheese lover ive tried it almost every place that offers it in astoria sweet aftons is still my favorite the burger is delicious so is the chicken sandwich great selection of beers and ciders to go with it .
if i could give this diner no stars i would i have been here multiple occasions and every time i have been disappointed between oily soup burnt mozzarella sticks and just plain grease lathered tasteless panini sandwiches which werent even pressed .
great for drinks .
the worst diner ever service is pathetic food was dry and not even the potatoes were good how can you ruin potatoes .
i love this place its such a chill laid back bar it definitely has the brooklyn hipster vibe its got a pretty good crowd and the prices are decent .
kinda grossed out by bus boy clearing dirty tables then immediately pouring coffee and setting tables with clean silverware without washing his hands also food was blah at best .
i love this awesome bar the craft cocktails during the weekend happy hours between 11am430pm rocks havent tried the brunch menu yet so cant say but for dinner and drinks the bacon mac and cheese is simply delicious craft cocktails are quite amazing beers on tap .
not worth the price a diner should know how to properly cook overmedium eggs and when i ask for dry toast i mean no butter too many other breakfast joints on staten island dont come here .
decent priced drinks quality food and good comfy seating i think they were going to the rustic look think big thick wood tables dark color motifs bench chairs and i liked it enough that im going for seconds within the same week sounds good right im a fan .
dumpy diner with grumpy waitresses the food was blah .
awesome mellow place to relax have a few drinks and a fried pickles .
diner of last resort food is mediocre at best waitresses are from the 1960s and cleanliness is apparently optional .
nice place for a good burger and nice beer came here on friday night had a burger fries and some pickles pickles were little to spicy for my taste but my husband loved them would come back .
sadly not that great just mediocre but for a city that in my opinion has the best italian in the world its sorta blah cool place for a drink though .
both of my experiences here have been on dates and it served me well both times it was a good time even though it was very crowded i guess it has a certain ambiance to it that is conducive to good conversations .
the food and ambiance was ok the price more then it was worth .
best grill cheese every fries are awesome as well would like to go back and try more .
pass appetizers were gross pad thai came with the wrong meat and was pretty subpar atmosphere was nice maybe they make some things well i wont be back to find out maybe youll do better .
good bar with a fun atmosphere the kind of place youd bring your brooklyn friends to and gloat about how much less youre paying to live in astoria than williamsburg also solid beer selection i havent had the food yet but ive heard good things .
to be avoided food was ok not great ordered the pad see ew and received something with the wrong noodle over charged i recommend sticking with tiny thai or honey thai restaurants .
local bar .
thier quality has gone down lately we got the parm and a pizza and both were pretty bland .
this is my fav bar in astoria the iced tea cocktail is really yummy and so is the mac cheese it actually gets really crowded on saturday nights .
the manager at gusto has been extremely rude and condescending to me on several occasions the food is decent but really cant stand being treated badly as a customer luckily cheap italian places are a dime a dozen in philly so i wont need to go back .
the energy in the place is just perfect for me drinks are very reasonable food quality is good ambience is nice this will be my favorite place in astoria .
this place is so close to my house i had to try it out pizza is slightly less than mediocre wouldnt get pizza from here again the wings were ok i wouldnt rave about them but i would considering just getting an order of wings from here again .
hamburgers were amazing the mac and cheese was also delicious i highly recommend the place it is first come first serve on the tables so it might be a little hard to get a seat at peak times .
the good the cheese and sauce were pretty good they had those elements down the bad the crust is tasteless cardboard also having only portabello mushrooms and not normal buttons is a complete violation .
best burger in nyc hands down better than minetta better than jg melon better than pj clarks really perfectly toasted brioche bun la frieda meat generous layer of irish cheddar fries are forgettable better off with the fried pickles .
the food here just isnt that good its not authentic and some of the dishes teriyaki dont taste the way they should .
stopped in for a quick bite with some friends had the portobello sandwich absolutely fantastic friendly staff dont know where they get those pickles but make sure you get them before you leave easily some of the best pickles ive ever had decent prices nice atmosphere .
ive gone there several times over the past year the first couple times the pizza was pretty good however it seems to have gone downhill in the past several months the pizza dough isnt nice and crisp like it used to be and the toppings are consistently overcooked .
two things you must try at sweet afton fried pickles and afton burger top that with samuel adams you cant go wrong .
ridiculously overpriced paid almost 40 00 for a mushroom and spinach pie and it was soggy would not recommend .
i recently met a bunch of friends here its a really cool place with great food and good drinks this is the beer garden alternative for winter .
overrated and expensive for what you get there are better options in wh .
this place has such a wonderful atmosphere it is to die for so calm and romantic in a way but you can definitely enjoy yourself with a few friends here as well great beer selection and delicious food highly recommended .
is this closed i went there yesterday and the store was being taken over no new address posted .
a super cool neighborhood bar with half part casual tavern feel half part trendy farmtotable type menu a welcome addition to our evolving neighborhood drinks are good food is basic but delicious and the crowd is mostly locals looking to cool off after a busy week .
salty as all getout and i am pretty sure it was garlic salt why did i pay over 20 for a large salt pie without real garlic on it .
candle lit excellent beer selection great food and on monday nights live jazz trust me this is a great spot for any occasion .
it was first time visiting and i didnt know what or how should i order my burger but the cashier didnt help me at all she was so unkind and rude i will never come back here again .
dont go here unless you want to have sex on the first date or get drunk on the 2nd gordon ramsay approves .
i was very unimpressed the meat was very bland and the bun was extremely average the fries were boring as well not worth it imo five guys is better .
fried pickles rock love the beer selection .
wasnt good today we came in and the place reeked like someone just smoked weed homeless people looking for food and bothering even checking the trash can this place hasnt been busy lately the owner should wonder what their employees are doing and why its not busy v .
fantastic cocktails in astoria great place to meet friends and have a few bartenders are always super attentive i even hosted a surprise birthday party here from my best friend and the staff were super accommodating no frills .
i had a cheeseburger and fries the burger wasnt seasoned and the fries were sooo salty wont be going back definitely have had better burgers elsewhere like axis pizza in uni city .
very nice place portabella burger was excellent good beers good mac and cheese gets pretty packed so come early to get seating .
i ordered a turkey burger twice from here and twice it was raw in the inside and the messed up my order of fries every time im there .
best burger ive ever eaten cant think about this place without dreaming of it .
poor cooking had to return 2 falafel burgers because they werent cooked and told by staff well thats the way we cook them which makes it ok for it to be raw not overly helpful staff overall .
love the ambiance and the fried pickles .
not a huge burger fan but i honestly went to try the truffle fries the burger was okay and the truffle fries were truffley overall not worth a repeat trip .
nice atmosphere garden area is beautiful i love this place in the afternoon during happy hour most stuff on tap is four not a bad deal the food is great a must go late at night or on a lazy hot day .
one word sucks you would think that for 6 bucks they would give you a decent bun dam dinner roll .
great service great food and nice bartenders .

9 75 for a pint of guinness are you having a fing laugh 9 for the pint and 0 75 tax tax on a 9 pint of guinness please dont go here its blasphemy and extortion to all irish men and guinness lovers .
delicious food and drinks great ambience one of my favorite spots in astoria spicy gimlet must have .
the only thing good about this place was that i got a free cider the burger was dry and boring the tartar sauce for the fish and chips had spoiled and tasted sour and rotten and on top of it all the service sucked i will never return .

i really like this place wish it were a little closer to home good food very respectable whiskey selection great ambience whats not to love .
attempted to grab a drink before our show the place was busy but not packed we waited over ten minutes for a bartender before walking out the decor was very nice and the drinks looked good but if you never get the chance to order whats the point .
overpriced but pretty chill good mixed drinks and nice beer selection dimmed lights give a good atmosphere .
lillies please make your restaurant wheelchair accessible i called to make a reservation and asked if it was wheelchair accessible the host said yes then she said well all the chairs are high barstool style barstool height chairs are not wheelchair accessible what a lost opportunity .
i constantly crave the fried pickles here this is by far one of my favorite places in astoria make sure not to get there too late or there wil be no tables left .
while the place is super adorable and i really loved the decor the service was not great and the food was just ok menu was a bit lacking in variety .
great service awesome vibe a experience .
bad service they didnt come to our table so we left place had bad taste decoration during christmas too much for the style of the place cant tell about the food but we were not the only one waiting and the place was empty .

my favorite bar in new york city the fried pickles grilled cheese and mac and cheese are decadent but delicious gets a little packed and loud but the atmosphere is awesome .
ever heard this one girl walks into a bar and asks for an amaretto waitress returns 20 minutes later to say we ran out really then in my book youre not allowed to say you have a bar you are just a knickknacky victorian restaurant so there .
sweet afton a hidden gem that seems to be hiding around the corner of 34th street in astoria a great hangout barrestaurant that features its aphotic and candle lit decor that mends well with the bar the music and its patrons .
price fixing seems to be in full effect between downtown cheese and salumeria and the staff at salumeria was pretty blase bordering on rude the meats were less than impressive and i just couldnt get excited .
this place gets very crowded so i would advise getting there early filling yourself with rye root beers and leaving before you cant move around or get at the bar .
the service was non existent after taking our order the waiter disappeared and the food took a really really long time the waiter said it wasnt his fault and the manager could not have cared less the food is not good enough to justify the bad attitude .
i came here for brunch last saturday i loved the atmosphere and the food was delicious make sure to try the black pudding .
watch out they will charge you more tips than you write i will never come back again and tell my friends .
had a couple beers down here and will be coming back to check out the food everyone was really friendly and the bar tenders were great this seems like a nice local hang out spot living just up the street .
i had an 8pm reservation at 9pm i left zero control over front of the house hostess didnt seem concerned and based on the queue i suppose i could understand why she wouldnt care nevertheless just be honest with your attitude towards indifference .
i was here on a friday night at the bar with some friends its a nice solid place for drinks decently priced with a nice environment didnt stay too long but i had a good time for the time i was there and i will definitely revisit .
bad service bad attitude and yet he put a 20 tip without our consent there wasnt even a thankyou we waited for an hour for our food the worst part was that customers that came in after us got their food way earlier there wasnt even an apology .
dirty pickle martini .
service is good but the food i ordered something like seafood pasta with red sauce the clams and mussels are totally not fresh i didnt touch them after the first bite so disappointed .
yay queens i wish there were more places like sweet afton kickshaw and dutch kills are there .
promising menu included gluten free pastas details for which were confirmed by the hostesses and waiter but was definitely served food with gluten and got really sick afterward not allergy friendly and despite getting the right answers up front dont be fooled .
awesome little bar probably my favorite in astoria great atmosphere tasty food and delicious drinks if you like pickles you have to try the pickle martini the lemonade and punch are also well worth the money .
slow service a barman who had to read recipes off a card and took ages to make our drinks and a decidedly uninspired tomato pasta no thanks .
great beer selection picklebacks are dangerous and macaroni cheese with bacon sobers you up .
beef tacos were decent kind of dry and expensive for what it was the chilaquiles were not good at all 1 star for the dish it was not what i expected i read the reviews and was very excited to try this place now im just left disappointed .
yummie burgers good for meeting new people and is also a good low key hang out for a group of friends the music isnt blasting so you can actually have goood conversation sheesh finally .
they have great food but they advertise delivery and they do not deliver they say they only deliver on a limited basis which is never .
been here two or three times the beer food and ambiance are amazing decently sized and overall great spot to catch up with some friends service was decent though it could be somehwat pricey 13 for fruit and cheese plate overall good spot .
after eating here i have conluded i am only reading reviews in spanish for mexican places the tacos here are okay not spectacular way too expensive for quantity and taste 8 for two tacos at a take out place what am i missing that the other reviewers had .
one of the very few places in queens where single people go in groups of less than 400 good drinks excellent seating decent food .
very rude counter people really a shame with so many restaurants around you dont want to come back because of the attitude it appears they dont know anything about customer service .
great bar probably one of my favorite in astoria good beers nice cocktails yummy food cute bartenders plus ive met some cool people here only problem it gets beyond packed on saturday nights to the point that you cant find a place to standsit .
the cashier made my sandwich using the same gloves she had worn to touch the money that myself and the customer before me paid with its not that hard to change gloves before making food .
great little bar love the ambiance it is trendy yet relaxed the bartenders are always friendly great place to go with friends or on a date .
they get one star for having bad attitudes they should have got no stars but thats not possible with yelp their drinks are always inconsistent im highly disappointed .
cheap drinks and loads of hipster look alikes the former wins .
so overrated the food is overpriced and the hoagies are not that great before it was more authentic had a very homey feeling now they are so rude wont be spending my money here again .
i could see sweet afton becoming the new and improved pseudo beer garden in astoria within the next 5 years i hope bahhhh hum bug to the bohemian and studio squared to the fellow astorian sweet afton is like a chunk of brooklyn in astoria .
good cheap banh mi nasty nasty service the older woman behind the counter made a store full of people wait while she ranted at the staff for 15 minutes it made me so uncomfortable i left my purchases unpaid for on the counter .
dig great design never made it past the front square never needed to service is great speedy both times with good recommendations this is one of my favorite brew spots in astoria .
i just wanted a good tasty banh mi and they gave me a premade bland sandwich ive never been to a place where they dont make them to order in my whole life this was the first banh mi that i didnt finish bleeccch bad bad bad .

my two experiences have resulted in luke warm entrees togo i maybe caught a bad time periods but really wanted it to be great plantains are okay i may try a different entree if im at stop shop but wouldnt bring my friends there as superior meal .

frickles gruyeresmothered burgers awesome fries and delicious brunch sweet afton is my favorite spot in astoria the bartenders are adorable and the drink menu doesnt disappoint either .
ordered for buffalo wings and it was like wings topped with sauce the folks who make this are are spanish guys who are just doing their job did not see that passion and taste in the food at all .
super comfortable good lighting super staff good beer a step above good bar food and right in my neighborhood the one bad thing is well i havent found it in 6 visits .
pizza is below avg they leave it out all day and serve it hours old nothing special at all maybe decent for a fast lunch nothing more .
amazing chill hangout for late hours in astoria great wine list and apple cider in the winter yum .
slow and touchey service 12 the mussels were not properly cooked thankfully they let us replace the mussels with a dessert however it hardly made up for how mediocre the food was and how terrible the live music was .
the kind of place you want to go every day to just hangout after a long day of work .
i wanted this to be better the ambiance is perfect super quaint and cozy but everything kind of lacked flavor and i never left thinking wow everything was perfect .
the only bad thing about this place is how crowded it gets but you cant hardly hold it against them for being successful they deserve it .
adorable restaurant with great atmosphere but the runniest mac and cheese ive ever had so unfortunate that the food was terrible because i really did enjoy the space as well as the lovely jazz band that plays there on the weekends .
great food mike has the mac and cheese and i had the portabella burger great ambiance but a bit loud .
the atmosphere here is perfect but the service is terrible i went to moto for lunch on a weekend after waiting 30 minutes for them to make me a sandwich they delivered the wrong one it was delicious but the lack of service makes this place worth skipping .
cool place to hang out and grab a drink the food is different and delicious def a nice change from typical greasy bar food laid back but classy all the same loved it .
considering the neighborhood its a nice place for a cocktail other than that the food portions are tiny and overpriced skip the risotto soupy rice without seasoning .
good beer selection mixed drink selections are solid limited menu but they all taste anywhere from decent to great friendly and prompt service beer battered fried pickles with spicy sauce great fries are limp decent definitely a place worth going to on a regular basis .
we found a maggot in our artichoke living and breathing .
great burgers and nice selection of beers .

i live in this area and this bar is the coolest place in astoria great for informal business meetings management and staff are friendly and helpful cant recommend this place enough must have a pickle back shot and fried pickles .

cucumber collins fantastic great local hangout love the decor .
very mediocre ramen if you must come here get the thin noodles not the thick wavy ones i also like the spicy versions better than the non and dont order the curry it tastes like it was made from a powder .
burger is unreal .
a blank for vegetarians also lukewarm food if not broth noodles tasted like from a box and where did my egg go damn ya .
hipster pirates of the caribbean with a fryer and booze .
nothing impressive everything is just edible especially the broth is so not right that seems to have been thickened by corn starch or something like that but the broth is an important component to good ramen .
attentive barstaffwaitressesbartenders eclectic beer selection recommend abita will definitely be back to try the food mixed bag of patrons solid atmosphere full but not crowded .
they know they cater to a university crowd so they barely tryits just not good food hike up to upper darby for a koean fix .

it is not a sports bar it is a very cute place great for a date it can get very busy they make great burgers there is an outdoor garden in the back i like it .
trendy restaurant off of the main street was somewhat disappointed with the food had the souvlaki sampler pork chicken and vegetable and found it to be rather mediocre the chicken was bland the pork had too much salt and the vegetables were just vegetables nothing special at all .
love it my new neighborhood hang the bartenders knew us by name after our second visit good drinks and a reasonable price .
food not great not wellprepared seasoning off small portions and overpriced service shabby my friends dinner came twenty minutes after mine place smells like the smoke thanks to the open windows and the folks smoking out front from the bar next door .
love sweet afton great beer selections and interesting food menu get the mac n cheese awesome i love the vibe of this place the rustic wood and candle dimly lit vibe astoria needed sweet afton .
horrrrrible ordered food at the bar and it never arrived after 1 hour they forgot to put the order in and said they would expedite it after 30 more minutes it never arrived had to leave but they were nice enough to not charge for the missing food .
more than 170 5 or 4 star reviews cant be wrong sweet afton is my all time favorite in astoria great coctails decent prices friendly staff famous fried pickles quality customers what would you expect from a local bar .
we were quite disappointed with the quality and style i think they were trying too hard on trendy greek food and it just fell flat the service was ok however its just not worth going here when there are better choices nearby .

i just got delivery and the guy gave me someone elses order i tried calling to let them know and no one is answering their phone seriously this has happened twice to us .
love love love love their pickle martinis 4 stars cuz its practically pitch black in there candlelight couldnt help me see the menu so i asked the waitress to order her faves for me yummy burger fries and lots of pickle martinis .

too bad for a former favorite going downhill lackluster watery tomyum not too fresh squid salad disinterested rushed service .
love all the organic paleo glutenfree options the only thing im not a fan of is the loud music .
holy shiite this place has gotten even worse their food is inconsistent one day its too sweet the next too salty same dish ordered different day when asked why its different waitress just shrugged her head nevermore .
save for the occasional poorly executed dish everything here is delicious especially the elk meatloaf i recommend staying away from the soy latte weirdtasting and raw chocolate nut brownie plain down bad .
worst thai food i ever ate i dont even know why people give this place a good rating the food here is disgusting fried rice is tasteless i cant belive i spend money on this crappy place .
my go to for takeout and lunch only con is the minimum delivery charge is 3040 a bit pricey for one persons lunch .
definitely not the best thai in nyc try bangkok tasty in astoria but even if it were the best thai the service is nothing short of atrocious if rude arrogant rushed and impatient service is your thingthen go to this place .

the food is fine but the service is so terrible that you may never get it there are many better options if you dont believe the hype .
you get what you pray for good quality amazing taste but a high price personally its worth every red cent .
closed wednesdays wtf .
the breakfast burrito with chicken is the way to go one of the more reasonable options 9 hu kitchen has wifi and surprisingly is not a bad place to get work done you will feel clean eating here .
the service was the worst ever the server got rude attitude even before i started my dishes i lost my appetite the dishies were not that delicious this place is overrated period .
i dont enjoy the food dont like the taste but i have to admit that the food is very well prepared i have to agree the food is very good though i dont like it .
too much hype again i had the pad see euw and i was not impressed the portion was small for the price never again especially when i can go to better places i rather go to arunee thai in jackson heights .
healthy and delicious perfect for paleo or non paleos who care about what they put in their bodies now if they could just open one in brooklyn .
this place is totally overrated we came back to my old neighborhood to try this place it was a totally disappointment the food was bland there are better thai places through out the boroughs .
hu kitchen you are eating away my wallet i come here almost every day nothing but great things to say but i really do wish it were a dollar or two cheaper .
quailty has definitely fallen at this establishment as they grew they seem to have paid less attention to their food maybe they should down size and remember what got them the reputation in the first place .
this place is truly wonderful ive eaten in and had delivery the staff are super friendly and food is delicious love it .
the food was so spicy i could not stop gulping water after every bite inspite of me asking for mildly spiced .
ive only gotten delivery from hu kitchen and now that our office moved i can no longer order it through seamless im at a loss their roasted chicken and grilled pineapple was my lunch goto best roasted chicken in the city great quality food thats consistent .
not worth my breath salty and mediocre at best .
paleo heaven always go there when i am in the area .
how very disappointing 300someodd reviews and 4 5 stars the food here was excrutiatingly average i cannot believe this is the best thai in new york perhaps we went on an offnight .
like wholefoods but not a zoo or a grocery store so i guess its like the buffet section at wholefoods awesome selection of healthy food drink and smoothies .
its cheap i guess i dont really like thai food or maybe i just dont understand it but its still really cheap .
healthy delicious and fabulous a new favorite of mine especially after a zumba class when i am starving healthylifestyleathu .
i dont get the raves about this place i got sick to my stomach after eating here maybe it was just an off night but im not going to try it again .
sure its a little on the pricey side but its healthy fast food that cant be beat .
the delivery has taken 90 minutes still not hereowner could care less i asked her to contact driver she said he was not answeringshe was indifferent terrible attitude she lost our family as a customer mitch .
i had a wonderful time here the food was filling healthy and quick i cannot ask for a better afternoon meal than at hu i will be a regular here after trying the rotisserie chicken roasted sweet potatoes and roasted pineapple with cinnamon what an amazing guiltfree indulgence .
low food quality had a pho vietnamese noodle for lunch and half hour later my stomach is hurting badly .
this may be my new favorite place to eat in the city they have paleo options and everything is delicious the staff is super nice too .
kind of pricey was expecting better sushi they do cover cantonese chinese and japanese food .
was a little skeptical about coming in here but it was pretty good i had the meatloaf and the sweet potatoes they were all delicious it also tasted fresh and its good to know that the food is gmo we need more fresh food restaurants like this .
very bad food .
this place is cool i feel so healthy after i go because the food is so pure its a way to eat well on the go but ive also had comfortable long meals there too .
terrible food with terrible service will never come again .
my new favorite health food spot you have so many options the prices are fair and they focus on whole nurturing ingredients if you are lactose intolerant and on a paleo diet this is the place to be .
too much msg in their curry laksa lips swelled up afterwards and itching for water the place is cheap and humble but come on dont mask the food by putting msg its not classy .
sensational food the employees are somewhat brain dead though .
slow and bad service food doesnt even taste any good wont come back again .
what a treat to find such great glutenfree organic food it was hard to decide what to have because there were so many wonderful options food was delicious .
the owner of this place is not as friendly as the previous owner who would go eat at a place where grade c were given if you dont know what grade c meant maybe you should go find out and think twice before dining there .
wow the food here is great i got the moroccan chicken over root vegetable purée and im sold this place is perfect for a quick lunch i def dont recommend it for dinner since the portion are very small def worth checking out .
went here on the strength of the reviews but the food is below average we ordered all the dishes raved about on this page the curry was bland redang mutton was all bones in a listless brown sauce not sure what all the fuss is about .
1 star off because it is a bit pricey for lunch but the primal chicken parm tastes great veggies are good too more like steamed kale salad .
the roti canai was good but the beef randang was below average the nasi sam al udang was lousy .
so delicious got the rotisserie chicken and roasted sweet potatoes also got chocolate bar with figs yes it can be a bit pricey but its healthy .
i dont know about other food but the mee rebus was far from what i expected its not the noodle soup like the one in malaysia or singapore and it doesnt taste good at all kinda disappointing the hokkien char was okay nothing special about it .
cant get enough if you like healthy delicious this is the place for you .
taste bad is dirty and overrated it is cheap so i guess you get what you pay for including maybe food poisoning they had 27 violation points on their 1132011 nyc health inspection which i suppose was an improvement on the 36 violations they received on 12102010 a816restaurantinspectio… .
the best of the best please come to las vegas .
only a few dishes have an authentic malaysian touch to them the nasi lemak was a let down the roti canai was nothing but the readymade malaysian paratha by kawan .
this place is amazing i eat here almost everyday and am always happy with the food the staff is also very nice and competent i would highly recommend eating here .
taste good was shut down today by the city health department and their stupid restrictions now i may never get to try it .

though the staff is friendly the food is made with either ambivalence or just plain hate the eggs are cold and old the bread and pancakes dense and stale gross .

absolutely disgusting if you do not have any taste buds or if you are over the age of 70 this place is great for you .
im a huge fan of their high quality organic grain free dairy free approach very refreshing chose to sample a number of both hot and cold items and was very impressed with everything coffee was good too great find .
i cant disagree that the food is good and the service is friendly but the place is depressing the decor is from 80s and the patrons are about in their 80s it is not fun to watch married couples eat their meals in silence .
their food is fresh healthy and delcious however their chocolate made with coconut sugar is the best thing youll eat all year the best part is that there is no sugar high or feeling of heaviness since all the ingredients are top notch .
came here for brunch and will not be back the drinks were fantastic bloody mary bar mimosas etc but the food was mediocre flavorless and unimaginative and the kitchen and service was incredibly slow 3 5 hours for brunch id rather not .

food was not so great steak was served sliced on the plate which was fine but a few of the slices were all gristle and fat i would not go back .
their noyo parfait was the best parfait i have ever had in my life hands down they are expensive but worth it .
small servings coupled with underinformed poor service across multiple servers has made this a once and never again place .
love wish there were more options like this out there so cool to have the paleo spin also there is yummy treats and take homes to bring into the kitchen at home .
the burger used to be good but not anymore the place is over priced the food takes a real long time to come dont go here go to kite and key .

rude servers absolutely disgusting environment over priced subpar food and very strange going ons some people doing drugs in the bathroom no no no .

excellent fondue good selection in the menu waffle cut fries were the suprise package dont miss that .

not only the chocolate drinks their burgers are awesome a must try place for chocolate lovers .
i am so surprise i see so many good review for this place shocking or is it just vermont lol .

just got the churros to go totally worth it got milk chocolate sauce raspberry sauce and caramel the place is real neat and has a long menu i licked my sauce cups clean wish i lived closer time to move back to njpa area .
how can you people possibly keep going back to this place and pay an exorbitant amount of money for crappy food visit la costenita 450 amwell road in hillsborough for a taste of authentic mexican food .
i was blown away by the dinner choices and taste great dessert is expected but items like the cheesesteak waffle and bacon mac n cheese were unbelievable atmosphere is lowkey but food presentation is stylish and fun bottom line i would definitely go back again .
not great not terrible had the fish tacos blue corn soft shell cash only byob .
love this place its never a disappointment i had the cheese steak waffle which doesnt sound good but it was solo good desserts and beverages are incredible as well weve been there a few times and im sure we be back for some more .
very friendly staff communication was strained nachos were very good but portion small the rest was very good .
delicious dessert i had the tutti frutti waffles perfect portion for the price parking garage right next door is very convenient .
i found a long hair in my food that was clearly wrapped inside the burrito it was the most unappealing thing ive ever experienced at a restaurant the staff handled it well and did not charge me but theres not much that could help at that point .

the food here is not the worst or the best mexican food i have ever had the price is decent and ok waiters i dont think i will be returning to this place .

went here for a late dinner on a friday night last night i had the chicken and gat cheese salad served on a waffle and the italian hot chocolate amazing good service great decor and fun tableware fun but pricey gift shop will definitely eat here agin .
i found hair in my food that is the end of it i can tolerate a lot of things but being unhygienic is not something that is acceptable at this supposedly highly rated restaurant if there was an option for a zero star this meal is it .
smells yummy as soon as you walk in the door staff was very friendly and attentive the chocolate covered prailines was really delicious .
we live in the neighborhood used to go here often but every time i ate here i got an msg headache my husband always felt sick after eating here lovely place beautiful people but obviously they use food additives no thanks .
we went here for drinks the tiramisu and the white russians were so delightful the desserts were amazing as well .
my husband and i came here for brunch on a sunday yes the atmosphere of this cafe is cute and cozy but the food was very average with higher than expected prices a mediocre tuna burger with a side salad at 19 wasnt really worth it .
as all ways great deserts .
mediocre food at best unfriendly asked to dine at the bar and was given my meal in to go containers its a pityits on my corner heard great things gave it three tries .
excellent best hot chocolate ive ever had .
poor service help has a bit of an attitude food was just average we had brioche french toast and tuna burger .
fun atmosphere tasty chocolate cocktails yummy variety of food wanted more cocktails instead of dessert but will be sure to get some next time i go because they look amazing there is a cute little chocolate shop inside love this place .
the servers are all color coded with striped shirts .
i absolutely love this crazy baldheaded chocolatier the fact that you can get dessert and cocktails together its so delightfully decadent i especially like the way that they successfully attempt to add spice and heat to chocolate i found it nothing short of amazing .
the only thing this place has going for it is that is open all the time and the location the food is not tasty or filling .
awesome dinner before seeing wicked great service .
yuk i ate less rhan half of my burger it was tough to chew and cold even though i ate it right away would have returned it if i had time would not eat here again .
you had me at chocolate kids loved it the food was alright but i had the best dessertwarm chocolate chip walnut cookie with whipped cream berries and a beaker of warm chocolate to drizzleso good .
we spent two hours and a half on the train to learn they close at 8 not 9 as mentioned on yelp and google reviews .
this place is a real life willie wonka chocolate factory i was drooling .
very good pizza but absolutely no respect for customers was there on saturday came 1130am this place should open 12pm they was late 45 minutes no more again save your self time go somewhere else .
fantastic deserts the italian hot chocolate was the bomb .
pizza is decent but place is definitely a health hazard became extremely sick after eating here .
i enjoyed my few visits at brenners the only problem i have is that its so small t t .
ive been coming here for 20years quality and taste went down drastically and price went up drastically .
we had a reservation and they sat us right away the aroma instantely makes you hungry we ordered the corn croquettes that were amazing the kids loved there meals i ordered a brenner burger which was yummy loved the chocolate syringe would def come back .
overrated watery mozzarella way too expensive and not such crispy crust seriously dont waste your time go to ciccios or pizza wagon .
i like the creamy hot chocolate but dont overdue it .
the greatest .
great dessert and decent food .
no idea what the hubbub was about ordered 2 slices and they were soggy and burned burned like coal on the bottom black bottomed pizza with a snippet of basil for 5 i died a little inside with each soggy oily bite .
if there was a chocolate heaven it would look like max brenner it even has alcohol whoa .
not worth the i think it is nasty personally the wait to get a paper thin slice of pizza at the prices they charge is outragous .
i stopped in here with a friend and just grabbed hot chocolates we didnt eat here so i cant attest to the food but our drinks were great .
over priced and not particularly better than average pizza not a clean pizza place either .
decent place to take a date great place to take friends or family not cheap but worth the price in my opinion the solid comfort food is somewhat overshadowed by kickass desserts .
salty pizza .
the curtain call is delicious but dangerous i also happen to love their sunday mood pasta which sounds odd for a chocolate restaurant its a fun place to meet up with a group of friends and chit chat while sharing drinks and chocolate concoctions and food .
over rated as well as spumoni garden and the wait for pizza ridiculous its not gold its dough and cheese on to the next 1 .
yum try the eighties milkshake and the alfredo pasta one of my favorite lunches in the city .
no disrespect to dom demarco but this pizza just doesnt work for me its overpriced its too oily it doesnt have enough sauce and it has way too much cheese if you like an abundance of cheese and oil on pizza you may like this place .
love love love this place i would highly recommend making reservations if you are planning to go in a group ambiance is nice but can get loud we did not mind .
they do have great pizza the only thing is that it took me 55 minutes to get it since i ordered it .
trendy place to get desserts at the desert pizzas and sundaes are great and the chocolate infused beverages are lots of fun ive been to the new york and philly locations and both are great .
place gets shut down every health inspection that says enough never coming back here again plus its not worth an hour for 2 slices id rather order from the jewish spot next to it .
definitely a goto place for special occasions ive just gotten back with 2 other friends for my seeyoulater fete i would highly recommend the max white russian im definitely coming back in the hot chocolate weather for some good fondue too .
i dont see what the big deal honestly waiting forever in a small cramped space for good but not great pizza thats overpriced no thanks .
amazing i would recommend going there for desert after a light dinner elsewhere the first time i came here i enjoyed a big hearty meal and barely had an appetite for desert which is a musthave .
over rated over priced the guy is slow and the pizza had this weird aftertaste .
the food was great and the waffle dessert was amazing .
slow dirty long lines and rude pizza good but very expensive not worth it .
love it .
dont believe the hype waited 20 minutes online for a burnt slice of pizza that was notably one of the worst slices of pizza ive ever had i think ill stick to not rays la villa and spumoni .
good drinks great concept .
greasy i suspect he was unhappy with one of his ingredients when i was there and was trying to make up for it by adding too much olive oil it was good but it ended up making me feel sick .
if youre in the mood for chocolate or a decadent dessert then search no more to me the menu itself is more of a lunch style menu i recommend eating somewhere else and coming here for dessert stick with what they do best .
its ok i dont see the big hoopla about this place the price per slice is more expensive than manhattan i wish them good luck but its not for me .
love the chocolate fondu and the various hot chocolates its a great place to take a date after dinner for dessert i have never eaten the regular food on the menu so i cannot recommend it .
mediocre not worth the ride to the middle of nowhere heard they got shut down because or rodents later on too .
the entrees arent anything memorable but then again why would you go to max brenner for anything other than dessert try this place out if youre a chocolate fanatic and youll leave pretty satisfied a word of caution just watch the prices .
im in my 50s and lived here all my life i never liked this guys pizzia i dont know why everyone thinks its good when it sucks the place is filthy .
such delicious chocolatey desserts its heaven for a sweet tooth its a great spot for some girlfriends to catch up on conversation and enjoy something yummy .
waited 45 min and found a piece of hair mixed into the doughcrust area def not worth the wait price trip .
went to max brenner for dinner with some of my girlfriends we had a great time food was good but the drinks were amazing and desserts were out of this world i would definitely go back for drinks and desserts its a fun atmosphere .
pizza tasted fabulous though not the best ive had ever or in nyc and totally not worth the fact that theres a crazy long wait and the restaurant felt filthy so god only knows whats going on in the kitchen .
we usually go there for our chocolate cravings service is always spot on its always a good idea to reserve a table beforehand .
was not impressed not the best pizza in brooklyn .
the 4star applies for their sweets if you are hungry and looking for a meal do not come here go out to dinner first then come here for desserts everything and anything hazelnutey chocolatey and sweet here is awesome .
i just cant believe this guy charges 5 a slice it has become a real tourist trap for native new yorkers like myself save a trip for pizza that is nothing so special .
i love the chocolate here the satisfaction guaranteed is amazing the mocha madness is also i think ive had better mojitos the crepe was good but by the time we got it there was just too much chocolate so we didnt finish it .
its good pizza dont get me wrong but it dont live up to the hype i have had better and i have had worse for what they charge im not waiting in line just to order id rather have a slice from lb or johnnys on 5th ave .
delicious chocolate conconctions including the best mexican hot cocoa and chocolate pizza what is that you may ask go there now run dont walk and you too will experience chocolatebliss .
little over rated .
we had so much fun here great place to bring the kids .
good pizza way overpriced always jammed service not very friendly i felt like i was inconveniencing them ive had better for less and with friendly staff .
oh so good icy cold milkshakes and devine dessert pizza .
i get a better slice in my neighborhood joint for third of the price dont believe the hype overrated .
yum yum yum went for breakfast had a bagel with peanut butter and chocolate and the onion rings which were quite good omg cookie was good too quite pricey but its somewhere id only go once in a while when my pants are extra loose .
there is no way that this place can clear 67 violations in a short amount of time and be crowned the best pizza in brooklyn someone got a big bribe but more like alot of people got big bribes .
this place is a lot of fun with a solid menu and good food the hot chocolate is delicious and the atmosphere is simply amazing the aroma of the chocolate from the moment you step in is intoxicating .
im sorry this place is gross unsanitary and the pizza is greasy not worth the wait or the .
here gos a nice place to took your lady too great food and the best hot chocolate on earth im so going back .
i dont see what the big deal with this pizza is its super greasy there is nowhere to sit i wouldnt go there again .
how can you not want to seal the deal after eating at this spot chocolate is sexy and this place makes you want to get messy .
not what i was expecting it was surprisingly bad even though there were several outstanding reviews i am shocked that zagat gave that place a 26 it does not deserve that whatsoever waaay to greasy its not worth the hype .
if you love chocolate you will love this place i dont even love chocolate and i love this place and they have the best chocolate drinks like the chocolate martini .
i said it before and now the health department has stepped in this place is straight nasty enjoy that human hair and mouse droppings with all that fresh cut basil .
ive been eating max brenner chocolate since club monaco when it was still canadian owned was selling them love the bald mans chocolate he is all about chocolate all the time in israel he now makes ice cream too aldo it kicks booty .
over priced slice of pizza here i had better pizza in new jersey .
this place looks like a giant chocolate factory in a good way sorry no oompaloompas the food was great too not just the chocolate .
false advertising their not halal or kosher so why does it show up on both categories plus i had better pizza like from doluca on newkirk plaza and house pizza on avenue h .
very good bakery with fresh german breads and some really great lunch options sandwich selection is great they also did a fantastic job on the space which is open airy and well designed looking forward to trying more on the menu .
over rated not worth the wait would love to know when the last time those scissors were washed .
g cafe bakery now has a new haven location nice selection of sandwiches and all types of baked goods right here in town .
no pizza slice is worth 5 00 unless it has shaved truffles on it dont waste your time looking and looking and looking for parking or your money .
great cheesesteaks way better then pats or genos etc limited seating but friendly service and not too expensive 7 50 a steak definitely recommend .
the pizza may be good but its not amazing and it would really have to be amazing to be worth a two hour wait in a 100 degree room surrounded by complete mayhem go anywhere else .
must revisit them again i remember their steaks as good as any in south philly or a c juicy tasty and i loved their whole peppers sure hope they still have them .
i was on my way to coney island yesterday when i remembered my last trek beyond prospect park was to di faras i thought the pizza was decent to good but not worth the trip and the long wait .
the best philly cheesesteak pats and genoes are not the place to go once you come here youll see there is no where else to go .
in general this is where the neighborhood weirdos hang out if not here then in front of the train station not to mention his sons are just weirder 8x ive been there experience just gets weirderrrrrrrrrrrrrrr .
best cheese steaks ever fast service great area tons of parking i swear by them .
ive been there 4 times really great pie i love this pie as good as anything ive had in new haven ct but the wait just aint worth it figure a minimum 34 hour to when busy 1 hour fifteen .
ahhhhhmazing had it for the first time and fell in love its a small place and very crowded on game days though so call in your order about 45 minutes in advance .
came here with a group of friends for weekend brunch over the summer but i was not impressed with the food or the service for the location and price i definitely expected better .
have had cheesesteaks from all over philly dalessandrosgets my vote for bestand lots of meat most other places you need a search party for the meat .
i went there years ago and the dishes were great but the level has decreased over time i feel i am no longer going there unfortunately .
first time in pa first time having a cheesesteak well worth the drive from nyc really nice staff and delicious food .
i came for lunch and had a sandwich it was edible but nothing special service was distracted meh indeed maybe its better for brunch .
amazing philly sandwich and the staff was amazing and welcoming definitely my favourite philly cheesesteak sandwich .
terrible service burger cold by the time it got to my table and the department of health just closed them for 85 health violations evidence of live roaches and rats yum dont think ill be back soon .
best cheesesteaks in the city greet customer service too and fast .
i waited for over an hour for a table and then got way over charged on my bill all together the food was not worth the hassle .
best cheese steak ever staff is always friendly even at peak times when the place is packed and you can get beer togo bring cash and your order in ahead to reduce wait time they dont take credit cards and wont make your sandwich until you get there .
it took an hour to get two orders of the soup of the day and mac n cheese when we asked them why it took so long to come out they claimed they were too busy there were 3 other tables seated garbage .
not much to say except in my opinion best cheesesteak in philly forget about the pats and genos discussion just come here .
the pizza isnt as good as freshetta which you can get for considerably less at your local grocery store .
best cheesesteak sandwich i had in a while mustgo if in the area would go there everyday if there was one in north jersey .
yelp let me down on this one glad that this place makes some locals happy but was a real disappointment for me ordered 56 menu items including the lumpia shangai as recommended by another review and dishes were at best average and at worst inedible .
cant believed i havent been here before ive gone to most of the philly cheese steak joints overt the years this place is definitely the best perfect in every way .
one word for this pizza yuck dont bother .
the real deal when i comes to cheesesteaks always worth the drive .
i have tried this place on 2 occasions and the food it just very bland .
not the best but they are amazing i would eat one any day of the week and be happy .
they need to fix their menu on all major websites yelp menupage opentable and so on there was an almost 2 dollar difference on all menus and when asked whoever was on the other side was very defensive about it food is okay .
im a huge jims steaks guy i think they are the best on the planet but when someone ask me who is a close second definitely dels soft tender meat and creamy cheese its worth it to travel outside of the center city area for tourists .
try and order take outdelivery the woman that answers the phone is a major b she hates her job clearly my thoughts find a new one a noncustomer service oriented job asap .
my favorite place for cheese steaks not the same great neighborhood as pats but the flavor is just a tad bit better .
two stars for ambiance good was tasteless we had the red curry and the chicken and broccoli i love thai food but this lacked authenticity and flavor super disappointing waitress was rude didnt greet us or say goodbye wont be back .
hands down amazing staff is great and the food is to die for thank you for the hospitality .
this restaurant has a nice vibe though i have to say the huge water bug cockroach on the wall made me lose my appetite we ended up having to leave and couldnt enjoy the meal .
i think one can make an argument that this dalessandros deserves a michelin star .
spicy noodle was the best thing we ordered and was still very bland overall cheap but flavorless especially the calamari .
be prepared to wait but all good things are worth waiting for this is the philly classic the archetype of what a philly cheesesteak is and as always take time afterward to rest maybe even bring a sleeping pad cause you will want to take a nap .
service was good but food was not the chicken and beef in our fried rice and pad sew were dry and rough the sauces tasted as though artificial ingredients and preservatives were added to the dishes .
the best in the city get extra cheese on your steak i go here at least once a month just for the cheesesteaks but everything is awesome always packed no matter what day or time because theyre amazing .
food was horrible everything had the taste of cilantro and lemon just awful the only thing worth a damn was the spring rolls .
this place is really good one of the best cheesesteak ive ever had i personally think their 100x better than pats and genos small and very friendly environment highly recommended .
exceptionally rude staff .
came all the way from alaska this place was yummy try it out you wont be disappointed the staff is friendly a little short on seating but overall great food .
was much better a few years ago extremely disappointed in this place all the noodles were burnt and they definitely decreased their quality i will not be coming here anymore .
good food the only place i eat cheesesteak from great service great people nice place .
we had mango salad tom yum spicy noodles green curry nothing hit the spot .
their cheesesteaks are simply amazing there were several customers waiting in line but their service was fast i most definitely will be back .
why doesnt the phone number work here .
been going here since i can remember great atmosphere quick service and great steaks if you tip the lady behind the counter she tells the cooks and they all say thanks in unison its awesome .
great looking place hated the sticky and bland pad thai even the calamari was dry and bland .
one of the best cheese steaks in philadelphia friendly fast service it seems to be crowded all the time but i always find parking .
its time for an updated review of song i think like most slopers who first come here they love the place great prices food service but lets face it they is way too much sauce in your stir fry it could be sodium soup guys gotta chill out .
best cheesesteaks in phila for tourists wanting a real cheesesteak experience this place is a must just wish theyd serve fries .
maybe i went on an off night but i seriously dont get the great reviews nothing was terrible but the food is totally mediocre sure its cool and funky looking and the back patio is nice and the food is cheap at least but i wont be returning .
im not a native philadelphian so being on the search for an amazing cheesesteak was crucial to me if im gonna live here im going to have to know where to eat .
aweful over priced no flavor go else where i had the shrimp veggie tempura 2 dinky shrimp and a few veggies no flavor at all .
delicious no matter how you order very busy every time im here i always bring back orders from people in new york .
open at odd hours when other sushi places are not over zealous staff to take your orders and par presentation decent sushi an alternative to mixx a ok is all i can really say .
my most favorite cheese steak place in philly i used to come here when i was a little girl and lived just a few blocks away when i returned to philly 35 years later i had to return and enjoy the cheese steaks best cheese steaks ever .
you people are jokers with your 4 and 5 star reviews this is belowaverage sushi even by philadelphia standards the 4 rolls we ordered ranged from bland and flavorless to downright disgusting wtf .
while mamas still makes my favorite cheesesteak in the world alys makes the second best and gives mamas a run for its money while i dont feel compelled to describe a cheesesteak ill endorse its unquestionable deliciousness .
i am not well qualified to review airport lounges usually i just sit at the gate and read but anyway brooklyn ale is pretty good waiting a long ass time to get a table and get served is not .
tried this place today a friday at 2pm it was packed with a line out the door always a good sign absolutely delicious steaks had a chicken cheesesteak with american cheese fried onions and mushrooms cant wait to return enjoyed sitting outside too .
anyone see a lobster here tasty for fast food if you want something genuine on a bun head next door to underdogs .
visited philly for a few weeks and figured i needed some authentic cheesesteaks before i left i tried a few places in the city but this one took the cake it has an old school feel with the best steaks in town .
id come back here only a weekend where the turn over of food is fresher stick to the roasted chicken dont be a fool and order the cilantro seafood soup like i did the green basebroth is not fresh they do take cc .
authentic philly cheesesteak in an authentic neighborhood restaurant you wont be disappointed if you stop here for a cheesesteak sandwich or hoagie .
food somewhat good for real authentic peruvian cuisine try peruvian family restaurant a bit pricy but excellent .
the absolute best steak in history trust me the only steak even close is steves prince of steaks in ne philly .
terrible no taste delivery took over 1 5 hours although the delivery guy was very friendly i gave one star for this and he apologized for being late i threw away the food call it a 20 dollar donation instead now i am super thirsty .
this is the best cheese steak ever every time i visit philly this is a must stop never fails meet to my expectations .
ordered takeout with the new menu supremely disappointed mac and cheese entree was a joke container was just noodles and bread crumbs with no cheese we loved this place in the neighborhood but wont rush back after this effort .
best cheesesteak in philadelphia i make it account to stop here when i visit philadelphia .
the food was okay but i was grossed out there were dead flies everywhere we switched tables and it was not much better .
omg the best cheesesteaks my hubs and i yelped the best cheesesteaks and this spot popped up we came to have the philly experience after attening the 7th annual roots picnic so delicious also the locally brewed franks root beer and crem soda is awesome love this place .
i ordered the meatloaf it was served as two little patties and tasted ok i was warned though my gf said to keep my expectations low not much else to say about this place great location too they should step up their game .
i love dalessandros they have the best cheesesteaks some of the best cheesesteaks in philly period need i say more everything else was repeated by the way the place is small it is easy to pass by .
not a fan of the tiny portions and cold unfriendly service it was nice to eat outside but it felt like our waiter kept neglecting us i think this place is very very overrated and expensive for what you get .
thanks for proving to this fan of midwestern cheesteaks that philadelphia really does do them best .
i got food poisoning from the chicken pot pie i will never go back .
one of my all time favorite places to get a cheesesteak what more can i say other than i love this place recommend it to out of towners wanting the real deal .
new server absolutely ruined the experience wasnt attentive with any of our requests refused to refill drinks and even refused to come to our table to take our check my party thought wed found out new goto spot but clearly we were wrong .
truly awe inspiring its good to be alive and eat a dalessandros cheesesteak pats ginos tonylukes all others fail in comparison to the god given blessings of a real steak sandwich from dalessandros .
the food is okay i dont like kids at bars especially after 900 on saturday they were running around the back yard like it was a gym this has happened many times here if this annoys you dont go here .
ive only been to about 10 places in philly for cheese steaks and this is one of my top 2 great service and an awesome cheese steak i havent tried the top places downtown yet but this place is great .
nice brunch we tried the bb burger and eggs benedict nothing really to write home about pretty standard but it was done well for dessert the carrot cake hit the sweet tooth if im in the neighborhood i would try it again .
awesome spot i like the location and arrangement the space could s bit bigger but i could never use that slight complaint about their sandwiches awesome spot as i mentioned .
good spot good burgers fun foods like a bit of a trendy dive .
these steaks were really good my family loves them even my picky niece nephew love them they have a variety of hots that i love overall one of the best ive had in philly .
the burgers and fries were incredibly salty we ordered two medium rare burgers classic and bash and both were overcooked and greasy shake shack is 10 times better and 12 the cost to make matters worse the waiter was rude and had an incredibly bad attitude .
best philly cheesesteak ive had thus far love that the meat isnt too fatty i do wish there were more seating options in there but it is a small place love dalessandros .
hostessesrude waiterrude foodoverpriced and medeocreborderline bad paying a lot of good money for service and quality like this in manhattan is totally unnecessary i seriously wish wed turned out the door and gone elsewhere and had listened to my instincts when we walked in .
simply as good as a cheese steak gets their meat is high quality rolls are fresh and sandwiches packed perfectly .
kind of cool decor menu seems intriguing but it wont shake the world the bash burger isnt too special the pork carnitas were rich but slightly gristly the wine was good too .
my favorite cheese steak for the last 20 years never had a bad one on a side note chubbys across the street are very good better than pats or genos .
ughhhhh i think everyone just has really low standards for cupcakes in nj please hop on the path train in newark transfer in journal square and take it to the 9th street station walk to mollys cupcakes 228 bleecker st to taste the real deal .
absolutely love this place they never fail the fried onions the crushed pepper flakes uh it its too die for honestly .
this is the worst pizza i have ever had in my entire life .
i come to this place every time im in the philly area to put it simply this has the best cheesesteak in town if you want the classic philly cheesesteak experience come here .
the pizza lacked toppings it was cold and wet the servers were prompt but it wasnt the lombardis i visited 3 years ago .
the best cheesesteak in philly thats all you need to know just go to dels dont think about it any longer make sure to get a whiz wit .
service was ok i expected better pizza food channel showed this place was incredibly good no not at all charged me for refill on ice tea what the hack is that never going back again spend 50 to take a taxi there i felt really stupid .
this has been the family go to spot for years i live in nyc when i visit philadelphia i stop at dalessandros on the way back to nyc for cheese steaks to go .
traditional 2 pizzas and tip for 100 really barely any cheese if you want toppings you pay a lot more wouldnt ever go back not worth it service was good though .
small menu know what you want busy place friendly workers try the soup of the day in season .
way overpriced completely overrated dont get me wrong food was ok but ive had so many better pizzas in my life and this place is apparently famous to get a good pizza leave little italy .
delassandros is the absolutely best cheesesteak in philadelphia if you havent been you seriously need to go the meat is always fresh and the rolls which we all know can make or break a steak are phenomenal go get you one today .
you can always tell a good pizzeria by the margherita lombardis did not measure up because of the meager amount of flavorless mozzarella crust and sauce were of decent quality we also ordered a side of meatballs they were pricey but excellent .
my favorite place in philly for a cheesesteak we drive 15 min from fairmount in order to come here just old school greatness .
plain not as good as claim dont go there with high expectation then you will not be disappointed definitely dont worth the drive there for the ordinary pizza and average service .
best cheesesteak in philadelphia hands down and the middle aged lady that takes orders is extremely nice and organized .
i remember coming here on valentines day two years ago and we got a cold pie cold pies arent cool .
awesome cheesesteak is an understatement please do not go to patsgenos over this .
highly overrated .
this is the place for cheesesteaks in philly in my mind the cherry on top is the availability of assorted peppers to build your own masterpiece best cheesesteak in philadelphia period .
this is known to be best pizza in nyccountry but its definitely not there is always a wait since its become a popular touristy restaurant but this is nothing as good as grimaldis i rather eat 1 pizza than spending on this overpriced pizza .
great cheesesteaks and hoagies definitely the best in manayunk order and then take out theres not much seating and it gets really right and slightly awkward if you stay there to eat always easy to find parking nearby which is nice .
oh man that was an average pizza dry floury crust and a forgettable taste .
everything they say about this place is true after trying nearly every famous cheesesteak place in philly ive crowned this one the winner steak onions mushrooms and american thank me later .
the pizza wasnt so good the doe was kind of hard to chew we didnt get our drink until we had to ask for it .
excellent meat isnt greasy perfect amount of cheese the bread is not stale like other places .
over priced and not taste enough .
top 5 best cheesesteak in the philly area an all time favorite for me i get it with provolone and fried onions its absolutely amazing surprisingly their deserts are homemade and very tasty eat at the counter have a beer enjoy yourself .
the pizza is fair at best .
good shtuff nice little mom n pop on the corner in a burb outside of philly stopped in for a beer and a cheesesteak and was not disappoint .
most overpriced piece of bread i have ever had very little cheese flavorless sauce and toppings and unfriendly service pass .
really great place i dont eat meat so i always get the tuna hoagie they will do it any way you want it and it is always timely even for how busy they can get i always tip because they deserve it .
meh i wasnt at all impressed with our sausage and onion pizza and it took forever to come out i guess im just not into ny style pizza but at least i can say i tried it .
right down the road from my daughters college best cheesesteak in town it is well worth the wait we go everytime we are in philadelphia visiting my daughter i love mine with peppers n mushrooms whatever you get is going to be good .
although i have respect for lombardis legacy its just not that great and isnt fun to visit .
from a girl who can get horrible bouts of acid reflux to a restaurant that could potentially cause the worst acid reflux thank you for being perfect and delicious and not greasy youre the best xoxo .
its a great flatbread the crust is too thick to be a proper pizza therefore one star for false advertising if you cant legally sell your pizza as pizza in italy its flatbread .
best cheese steaks in philly .
no wait at 1130 am not sure why people are so crazy about this place ive had better pizza .
great cheesesteaks this place has been around forever if you are in the area you should be here .
been here three times trying to see what the fuss is about average at best terrible wait time i dont get it .
chicken cheese steak hoagie rolling rock and of course all those amazing dried chilis when i am ready to completely brake bad and eat myself into a coronary this is where i want to be .
mediocre try numero 28 for the best pizza in town a few locations but one nearby spunto and its sibling spots is also very good .
perfect meat not too greasy not too much ice in the cup double wrapping on the steaks friendly service they do everything right love the way they handle tips best cheesesteak in philly only thing i could find to gripe about is the use of styrofoam .
now that u have italianitalian restaurants in nyc americanitalian restaurants appear almost obsolete within the italian restaurant scenery of nyc especially in soholittle italy area .
never been to jims or pats and i have no desire to now that ive discovered dalessandros .
dont its a tourists trap pizza is average and service is terrible place is decorated with pictures of the owner with a few celebrities and many other lame photos please do yourself a favour and find another place there are so many others in little italy .
best cheesesteak in philly with normal hours jrp for fans of chopped beef .
you yelpers are generally on point i get this place is a landmark but guys this pizza sucked i have had better in los angeles this is nyc there is no excuse lost my vote on this one even though there was no wait .
cheesesteaks are good but it is the only place that has perfected the buffalo chicken cheesesteak a must .
underwhelming pizza was good but definitely not the greatest of all time not much more to say about this place definitely would try out another pizza spot .
best cheeseteak ever thats all i got .
i dont understand the hype ive been twice service is terrible you practically have to beg the waiter to take your order pizza is okay but nothing exceptional .
hands down the best steak in philly one delicious sandwich is enough for two meals i recommend adding their special hot peppers dalessandros is always busy but you dont have to worry about the obnoxious pushy service youll get downtown simply outstanding .
this place use to be amazing but the pizza always comes burnt on bottom even if you say lite the entrees are not good its all soggy and unflavorful what a shame .
excellent local joynt great food fast service great beer selection open late .
dont believe the hype the pizza is sub par the sauce is sweet and down right sugary this is something mexican cooks often do .
order everything then go to er unsung philly rough and delicious counter crew constitutes a philly chorus of local vowel mutations .
tourist trap never go there .
my reviews are normally longwinded but not much needs to be said this is the standard against which all other meals are measured .
over rated they sat us beside the bathroom as well super crowded tourist trap .
best cheesesteak in philly steak chopped very fine melts in your mouth .
bland oily pizza def overpriced nothing special somehow though this place smells deceptively amazing so its possible i missed something .
better than pats genos or jims tastier steak more courteous staff they will package steaks for travel pizza sauce and whiz on the side wax paper between the steak and the bread so the bread doesnt get soggy pats wont do that .
its more hype for tourists than amazing pizza experience there are many other less expensive quality pizzerias in the area i tend to like bleaker st pizza the best its great pizza only without the incredibly long wait and at a better cost .
awesome you know when youre in the right place when you walk in and know youre in the right place fast friendly family the sandwich that i had was heaven will go there again when im back in town .
did not like this im a wood oven pizza kind of guy .
ive been eating these cheessteaks ever since i can remember the best philly has to offer forget genos or any of the other big name joints here is where you want to eat a philly cheesesteak .
nothing special other than a line .
hubby and i came in october and shared a cheesesteak we really enjoyed our cheesesteak it was deliciously flavorful and we loved their help yourself pickles and peppers bar service was fast considering the long lines and very friendly .
this place was by far the worst place you can go eat pizza the pizza was salty and wayy too saucy the thing was literally dripping all over the table disgusting .
been going to dals since high school maybe even before that always on my list of places to hit up when im back in philly .
meh not as good as i thought it would be grimaldis is my choice the service here was pretty good my rating is based upon the pizza exclusively .
still salivating from this cheesesteak almost 30 days later amazing .
not bad but not up to par for ny pizza .
good cheese steak cut in smaller pieces and it hit the spot .
meh .
if your are in the roxborough east falls manayunk or germantown section of philly i highly recommend you try their chicken cheesesteaks .
rude staff we waited an 1 hour and half and still were my seated when i asked the staff she said we could just leave and didnt care bc they have other people rude .
my favorite cheese steak place in the entire world best philly cheese steak by far .
way over rated the dont have coffee you cant pay with a credit card and there are no options either for slices of to have 3 different toppings in different parts of the pizza .
the best cheesesteaks the amoroso rolls really make it they are super fresh and the steak is chopped fine with cheese mixedvin melts in your mouth .
was not the greatest pizza had better .
best of the famous cheesesteak places im sure ive had better but of the bighitters this is the best buffalo chicken cheesesteak is ridiculously good .
the sausages and pepperonis were like thick coins not thinly sliced like one would expect it was just ok .
great cheesesteak perfect amount of meat and cheese to the bun just as dirty and delicious as you might like the only possible downside is i reckon they could use higher quality meat until i found jims steaks these guys were kings in my book .
we ordered the cold antipasto what a scam for 14 very small portion not fresh its a tourist trap .
i am a philly native and foodie forget tourist traps like pats and genos for steaks they have nothing on this place meat is finely chopped moist and fabulous italian hoagies are also incredible after dalessandros i like jims at 4th and south and steve prince of steaks .
came here quite awhile ago but i still remember how disappointed i was with this place the pizza was cold maybe 3 minutes after it came out also soggy pizza is soggy pizza no matter how flavorful the saucestoppings are .
a really good cheesesteak in a momandpop environment not the best ive ever had but everyone has their favorite at this point youve probably already decided on going just do it .
not worth it go to john in the west village this is run by some corporation that needs to get a clue .
frickin delicious and huge friendly staff too place was packed .
it was ok its been a while since ive been there but the pizza at lombardis was nothing to write home about it doesnt compare to luzzos pizza on 1st ave that one is the best nyc italian ive ever had .
good great grand a simple delicious cheesesteak a dive in just the way it should be but with great service service with a smile you can order a beer and sit outside which in my book takes it up another level .
this is for tacky tourist .
i dont think im going to tell you anything different than the hundreds of other reviews on here dalessandros makes an amazing cheesesteak i make a 40 minute round trip drive to get one and its totally worth it just remember cash only .
typical floppyandfallsapart ny pizza the meatballs are delicious though more so than the pizza actually .
i havent been to this place since 2008 and i still dream of their cheesesteak dont miss out on an opportunity to try one .
same as grimaldis tasteless pizza sauce the only thing i liked was the crust my excitement was for nothing .
has been my favorite for 20 years perfect combo of roll meat ad gooey cheese a must try if you are a cheesesteak aficionado .
the most overrated pizza experience in new york city .
this place is awesome even though the d family arent the owners anymore they still carry on the tradition well .
yuck .
there is simply no better cheese steak on this earth i hear the chicken steak is good but im always too distracted by the thought of a steak to order one .
the pizza here tasted very bad and had almost no cheese would have much rather eaten anything other than this pizza overrated and bad .
ive eaten here since i was a kid and no matter where else i go for a cheesesteak there is none better than delies .
i guess im not much of a new york pizza type the pizza was extremely average and a bit overpriced nothing exceptional about the service or the atmosphere overall i was a bit disappointed after going there .
this place is one of the hot spots for some rich and generous cheesesteaks place is small but the food is right come by here and get what you want i would definitely say try their cherry plum pepper paste its off the hook .
soggy crust just hype may have been the first or one of the first pizzerias in ny but as far as good pizza they fall short .
massive cheesesteak and quick service came from dc and ate a cheesesteak with extra cheese american and onions and devoured it grabbed another cheesesteak to go this time with provolone and siracha money .
the pizza was ok nothing spectacular about it .
not sure if i wrote a review yet but i dont care i love this place servers are pretty friendly wish there were more seats available to dinein beer selection is small but decent ribeye is always overflowing .
the service was ok but i got the plain with anchovies and the anchovies made the already salty tomato sauce toooooo salty not worth the money and time .
best cheesesteak in philly went to all of the top cheesesteak places in philly and dalessandros was by far the best .
not impressed at all the pizza is somewhat avarage the service is bad plastic cupw jugs etc this place should do more to keep up the fame it built through the years not live from it seriously if you want a good pizza night out look elsewhere .
best cheesesteaks in the world yes better than pats or genos yes better than jims for a real cheesesteaks you cannot beat it .
went to this restaurant because of the reputation we were seated downstairs awful the pizza is ok nothing out of the ordinary .
best sub money can buy period .
dunno maybe im just partial against soggy pizza plus the place only takes cash .
best cheesesteaks ever hands down thats all i have to say you will find nothing better d .
i have had much better elsewhere and with much higher quality ingredients .
a superb experience not packed with the friggin tourists this is the place to go imho .
historical pizza place on spring street pizza is ok however i feel the place is more of a tourist trap than an amazing pizza spot .
delicious steaks consistent quality and honestly the friendliest people around love it .
a tourist trap with mediocre pizza .
one of the better cheesesteak spots in philly both the regular and chicken steaks are delicious not expensive and its definitely worth it only problem with this spot is the location other than that a great place to get a cheese steak .
waiting on a line for pizza youre in new york city .
lets keep this short best cheesesteak you will ever eat if you are a tourist skip pats skip genos and also skip whiz all together it ruins the taste of the entire steak go here get the cherry hot peppers and maybe even stick around for dessert .
not sure what they hype is about just regular plain pizza wasnt particularly good either .
hands down one of the best if not the best cheesesteak in philly their hoagies are fresh and delish too their 9 dollarish stella beer and cheesesteak deal sun thru thurs is an awesome deal as well a must try spot .
i was expecting a lot better this pizza was mediocre at best most dollar slices are better than this place i was truly disappointed sorry for the short review but i rather not waste anymore time on this place .
best cheesesteak in philly i grew up on these great grilled onions i have since tried pats pretty good genos lame and jims and all the rest no comparison .
fast and good service soggy pizza too much sauce too little time in the oven i think it had the potential to be a great pizza ingredients and flavors were there but way too much sauce and a translucent dough raw killed it .
excellent philly style .
over cooked sauce leathery crust texture definitely not one of the best .
dalessandros is my goto steak joint there might be better out there but this place is close to my apt theres free parking no ninja midgets to jump out and rob me you can eat in and theres beer winwin situation .
eh not sure what the hype is about got the margherita pizza kinda sucked sorry not a fan .
great service cheesesteaks never fail great beer selection .
the pizza is good but way too expensive especially the salad 11 and appetizers 12 the portions were very tiny also there is no refills on fountain drink and just make sure you bring enough cash .
chicken cheese steaks are da bomb .
this place kinda sucks .
this is currently my favorite cheesesteak i get the one with two different cheeses it adds a little tang definitely a substantial meal plenty of meat the 7 different peppers you can add to the sandwich is a great feature .
not a fan overpriced overrated save your money and go to grimaldis or di faris in brooklyn or artichoke pizza .
great steaks for those not downtown .
faded glory .
wow got the cheesesteak with mushroom onions peppers and provolone they give you a lot of everything i cant believe i finished that huge thing so good only drawback is small spacing .
meh dont get the plain pie undercheesed underbasiled undertasty im not going to list the hundreds of better places in the city .
hands down the best philly cheesesteak you will ever have in your life you dont know what a real philly cheese steak is until you make the trek out to roxbourgh to have the holy grail of cheesesteaks .
the place is more a tourist spot than anything else had a pepperoni and sausage pizza ive had better i admit their white pizza looked good didnt try it though so cant give an opinion id suggest asking locals of better pizza spots .
its a good thing i dont live near dalessandros otherwise i would spend all my money for their cheesesteaks love the tomato sauce and pickled hot peppers .
horrible one of the worst pizza i have tasted the breadsticks wee stale and hard and were sgusting the pizza crust was burnt overpriced and they dont accept cards i was super disappointed just not worth the money .
the greastest chicken cheese steak place that ever lived its my plan a b and c just wish they would do the whiz .
its a historic place but the pizza is not very good its like the pizza is made without flavor very bland kind of flavorless like a microwave pizza it was nice to go to the historic first pizza parlor but i wont be back .
my favorite cheese steak .
please out of towners dont waste your limited time and meals here the pizza is mediocre whole foods is better seriously .
oh my goodness i had this preconceived notion that was so far exceeded by delassandros i cant even tell you the pepper relish to die for good service great food can you ask for more i dont think so go now .
if you hate flavor and love diarrhea ive found the place for you go to sbarro your wallet and your stomach will thank you sparce toppings bland flavor service adequate overpriced and overrated .
random trip to philly leads to a cheasesteak eating frenzy not my favorite cheesesteak even though it was very good the best part was running into sean paul apparently its his favorite stop for a greasy meat filled cheeseseak .
this place is highly overrated we ordered a plain margherita and it didnt taste like anything special at all there wasnt enough cheese and the crust was super plain maybe this place is just not for me ill stick with forcella .
we went here because the reviews were very good it is so good it is cash only the service was exceptionally fast very very good sure beats pats and genos .
overrated overhyped cute room nice severs etc pizza is not bad per se but nothing to write home about .
home to some of the best hoagiessteaks ive ever had .
i recently found out that alleva dairy supplies their cheese i didnt make any ill comments towards lombardis cheese i just dont like the pizza itself i still think the toppings are overly salty .
this is whats up i love their steaks yea its cramped yea you might die running across henry ave but man you get a great sandwich here id choose this way over jims pats or genos .
waited 45 minutes to have pizza that my 4 year old niece could make seriously way over priced pizza dont get the hype put our names down came back 45 mins later to learn that they never put our names down .
yum i got referred to as hun about 6 times by the woman behind the counter the tables were cozy and full of regulars and i had a cup of crab chowder that was friggin amazing why must you be so far away .
as a deep dish fan i was hoping lombardis can win me over to the thin crust side nope wasnt bad but definitely wasnt even close to the best pizza ive ever had looking forward to finding good pizza in nyc next time im there lombardis wasnt it .
there is no doubt in my mind that this is the best cheesesteak in the country we recently went on a taste tour and went pretty far out of our way to try these steaks no doubt this is 1 for us with jims a distant 2nd .
had lunch here on a hot day in august tried the signature margarita pie and felt it was cooked too quickly at too high a heat .
this is place is so bad for you but so good probably the best philly cheesesteak forget about south philly vegas go to roxborough .
i stopd by this place during my visit to ny earlier this year i was not impressed by their pizza yes i know what a pizza should taste like the pizza was just ok the tables were very small service was good .
heaven on an amoroso roll .
overrated bruschetta had waaaay too many tomatoes and i didnt taste any garlic or basil really pizza was good but not great the fact that they dont take cards is an issue im not a cash carrying person nor do i really want 2 70 atm surcharges .
makes a good steak i gotta say real good but not the best .
disappointing it turned out to be a tourist trap tomato sauce was very acidic and where the hell is the cheese thin ass slices of mozzarella that just tease your taste buds before your flinch at the tomato acid ehrrmm sauce also totally overpriced not going back .
went back still great they have whiz now cut through the meat a little maybe extra whiz can tame this mountain of meat and onions .
terrible pizza ugly place and bad service 100 over rated i forgot to mention im italian .
best cheese steaks and more in philly hands down the bread the steak the condiments on the side best hot pepper selection too these steaks never miss melt in your mouth .
not so tasty .
yum yum yum made with love and it shows did i say yum .
it didnt live up to its reviews on yelp we had both a white and red pizza and i didnt really enjoy either perhaps i prefer the ny style pizzas better but i wouldnt go back .
excellent steaks at very reasonable prices its much easier to get to for the suburbanites than the other famous steak places the place is really cramped but the food is great .
this place was over rated over priced and just not worth the price really disappointing ny is that all you got .
yummy so good not open on sundays dont try to eat inside its always packed at the counter i think its cash only but might take cards .
pizza was not that great toppings tasted fresh but for some reason the thin crust was soggy when i started eating the pizza fresh out of the oven .
we decided to go here because it was voted best cheesesteak by the locals i trust locals the bread was perfect its a bit out of the way but so worth it .
quite disappointed of this place i wanted to believe the hyped but it lacks flavors i could get way better pizza for half the price of this place .
eight of us went after church there was a line to get in but is see why food was delicious and plentiful would recommend highly great value .
flavorless i used to love this place but the last pizza i had tasted like nothing im not even sure how that is possible pathetic place that takes advantage of their reputation and does not deliver on their product zero stars .
broad street diner serves yummy meals overall i have been there a few times and each time they delivered their french union soup is to die for definitely should try it the staff is quite pleasant as well .
probably one of the worst pizza experiences ive ever had in nyc soggy pizza expensive and long lines dont fall for the hype this is a total tourist trap spend a little time and plan a trip to grimaldis or difaras .
a family favorite for many years delicious diner foodexactly what a jersey diner is supposed to be pork roll and cheese sand which is excellent good breakfast served round the clock huge sundaes and tasty puddings prices are very reasonable very friendly quick and efficient service too .
i had the calzone here with cheese spinach and sausage the calzone was just average the crust was kind of bland but the cheese was good i would probably just stick to their regular pizza pies .
good food and staff that keeps me at a regular hi amanda .
i really like this pizza but not sure it is worth the long waits in line i love the area it is in .
ordered delivery and i got a cheerful delivery person in the cold rain food is excellent plentiful and comes hot i got beans a pastel and mangu with salami and cheese i dont like the egg with mangu sue me very good 12 for all that .
good if youre in the area but i dont see it being a must to go to the pizza barely had any cheese the sauce needed salt grimaldi was way better .
i love this place the people are always nice and the food is always good .
all the tourists flocking there should have given me a clue the sauce was really bland and the crust was soggy and unremarkable the waitress and hostess were nice though .
arrived nearly at closing time still got great service and was not rushed will come by for take out .
after reading all the yelp reviews i was really excited to try this place unfortunately i was very disappointed our pizza came out soggy im not sure from what but it was a total turn off id give this place another chance though .
good food large portions for price rotisserie chicken has good flavor and not dry at 330pm rice beans were good id return and recommend to others .
a pizza landmark turned tourist trap you can get cheaper better brick oven pizza elsewhere and its not like the atmosphere is all that great since the place is packed with outoftowners and this isnt even the location of the original store .
great beer selection reasonable prices on everything and custom made to order sandwiches for breakfast lunch and dinner recommend sandwich station strongly friendly service and a great place to get groceries in a pinch some basic essentials and booze .
maybe i expected to much this pizza wasnt the best i ever tasted at all i have made better myself at home although the place was nice and i liked the decor the pizza wasnt that great sorry .
awesome place to grab a high quality sandwich or hoagie great beer selection for take out and can mixmatch to your hearts delight try the italian or turkey hoagie breakfast sandwiches are good too .
aside from the history of this place its just not for me the pizza was expensive not that great and you cant even get a refill on your drink service wasnt even that great next stop rays well see if its any better .
i have only been here to grab a pick six they have an amazing selection i actually only go here when i want a pick six its not worth going anywhere else because they dont have the same selection .
you suck i came here craving your awesome clam pie and it was shit how can you screw up something youre famous for the crust was tough and dry and the clams were chewy and gross its over between us .
a great beer selection with specialties like daisy cutter bells blackout and cheaper than food and fries terrapin wnb moo hoo lost abbey port brewing and more the prices were decent for the area .
eh ok i get the whole oldest pizza place thing but its new york there is amazing pizza everywhere the service was hasty and the pizza wasnt that great dont think ill be back anytime soon .
spectacular club sandwiches fair prices for deli stuff and they dont skimp on the ingredients definitely the best ive come across in philly so far .
it was definitely an okay experience but ive certainly had better pizza and have had better ambiance the ingredients were good but it just didnt quite come together fully also wasnt a fan of the no credit card rule .
did they remodel something seems better about this beerstocked deli snacks sandwiches and all the usual suspects a wide selection of cold drinks good location and hours no issues from me .
many say that lombardis is the quintessential ny pizza maybe but id rather stick with lou malnattis chicago pizza that i get shipped in flashfrozen that beats the bland lombardis pizza with an imperfect crust anytime .
best deli in centre city no question great service friendly staff and an amazing deli that dishes out great sandwiches especially during breakfast 1 la colombe coffee as well cant beat that love this place .
you have got to be kidding me this pizza tastes like sauce on saltines .
great beer selection great prices and i go for bagels with cream cheese and breakfast sandwiches pretty often and they never disappoint .
im sorry guys rude staff burnt crust just not all that i was not impressed went there 3 times to give it the benefit of the doubt since everyone is always giving it such rave reviews johns grimaldis patsys and flushings lucias are all better choices to me .
you rockway to go got my sugar hill beeryippeeee cheers stopped by to pick up some brew for an anniversary .
overated pizza with uneven balance of cheese great if you are a tourist looking to just sample an institution try grimaldis if you want a real ny pie .
amazing deli great staff has everything that you possibly need beer sandwiches are also very delicious their meatball hoagie is really good better than old nelsons breakfast sandwiches are great as well my favorite local deli in center city .
watch out your bill even though you are a party of less than 6 people the bar adds 20 tip on your bill i ended up paying 40 tip sigh .
pizza in philadelphia that doesnt taste like cardboard thank god zios can make a good pie for sure some other items on the menu arent as good as id hope but its quick and easy to stop in here .
they refused to seat me as a table for 1 rude .
best sliced cheese pizza in the area the pros are that it has a great sauce and is open late the con is that its cash only .
the place is cute no doubt about it but it is loud and very jammed with a very young collegehipsterish crowd it does not make for a place where one can really have a good conversation which is a shame because the food is not bad .
good quality fresh pizza typical philly staff ive never been less than satisfied great for kids or quick lunch .
i took a friend this weekend and we sat at the bar and had a couple of drinks i love the space the wine and the food what really annoys me is that when the bill arrives they have added 20 to it without asking very obnoxoius .
best pizza in the city by far everything here is good cheesesteaks are awesome too i literally eat here every day and the tall guy with the beard is extra cute so thats always a plus but dont look at him hes mine .
the music is way too loud we were screaming over our food trying to hear each other we had one glass of wine and relocated down the street it was a really unpleasant experience .
grabbed a cheesesteak here did the special without bacon and it was tasty bread was not amazing just a standard hoagie roll lots of fillings pizza looked okay as well recommended if youre passing by or at one of the nearby hotels and need a quick bite .
a ok ramen place so overrated i dont understand why people would line up for 45 min for this you could get better ramen almost anywhere in the city .
really good pizza for philly and the rice balls when they have them are legit ask for extra tomato sauce .
waitresses are rude and mean and the noodles are too oily the pork topping is sooooooo soso flavor that doesnt deserve the time we wait and the money for it do not waste your time and money on this restaurant because their good marketing .
i had the barbecue chicken cheesesteak and it was delicious a huge sandwich and good service i really enjoyed my experience .
sooooooooooooooooooooo not worth the wait its pretty good ramen but i dont get the hype go somewhere else and save your time real talk yall ramen was kind basic not like ugg boots and a psl basic but like driving a volkswagen jetta basic .
im always in center city and im always coming here for lunch the buffalo chicken pizza is the best prices are fair and theres good service would recommend to anyone .
horrible service those young boys just dont have any manner go to another location if you really want their ramen .
great pizza great price and they are open late on the weekends what more could you ask for service was fast and friendly i only wish i had been in town longer to try a few more slices .
so overrated i cant believe i waited 2 hours in the freezing cold for that so not worth it .
i order from here at least once a week favorites include the hot veggie wrap grilled chicken wrap and fried flounder hoagie speedy delivery is a huge plus only downside is that theyre closed on sundays .
it was a very bad experience the food was good but the customer service was horrible the waiter was soooooo rude i have never expericed any disrespectful service like this i wont try this restaurant any more sooooooooo bad .
ordered pizza and cheesesteak while on vacation in philly and wasnt expecting much but was pleasantly surprised .
it was weak .
fantastic slice lovely staff and a great salad what more could you possibly need .
go to minca instead broth was not flavorful miso paste gave the broth a sandy consistency and pork was not tender .
i like this place good portion of pizza at good price tvs on the wall that you can watch sports there i would get in and have a slice of pizza when i am hungry and happen to drop by .
toto can never compare to ippudo or jin ramen even worse is the attendants attitude so disappointed by the food and the staff .
good food they seem to care and tried hard to make the food custom to order .
no matter what the food tastes like if you cannot handle such a looooooong line then you should not open a restaurant the user experience sucks if you do not want to eat with bad mood do not come here .
theres a lot of pizza in the area but zios is my favorite for a quick slice and a soda unlike some other places they never skimp on reheating slices in the oven their eggplant pizza is particularly nice i also recommend the fried dough with powdered sugar .
the ramen was bland was seated ordered and ate all in a span of 15 minutes and or server kept rushing us and if you dont finish your ramen there is no to go container i dont know what the hype is about .
a neighborhood pizza place that outdoes the average neighborhood pizza place the pizza is solid and has lots of options plus their sandwiches from the grill are very tasty a great option when you dont want something fancy but you also dont want to cook .
not worth the line waste of my time food was okay ippudo is much better and watch out for waitresses that would stop you for 15 tips even if you dont like their service .
zios is the best their pizza cheesesteaks hoagies and especially their pasta dishes are delicious they also have great italian specialties like arancini they are a vital part of midtown village .
i was very disapointed about this restaurant the soup is tastless and nothing special plus the service is very very bad and they did not respect the customer .
the pizza at this place is fantastic so many options for pizza by the slice and the fried dough roll filled with cannoli cream was amazing if i worked in phily id eat here everyday and id also gain 100 pounds .
it was my first time trying totto ramen i waited about 45 mins expecting greatness i love ramen i got the spicy ramen and my father got the mega ramen i think its overrated and not worth the wait i would not come back .
yummo i was starving scouring the streets for food bartender at bar told us to go get some pizza here had a white and a cheese absolutely perfect for the night definitely a good place to grab a slice .
speaking of eat and run nothing special certainly not worth the wait nor the price sayanora .
yep really delicious pizza friendly staff ample seating a center city rarity a pizza place with really good pizza service is fast even when crowded great cc lunch stop .
the ramen is good but not worth the wait also the place is way too hot in the summer to to no no .
great pizza and really nice people in a nice atmosphere if you want pizza give it a try .
im all for quick little ramen places theyre usually the best kind but there was hair in my ramen enough said i just prefer the standard noodles meat and veggies ill stick with ippudomomo .
these dudes are some of the best gd pizza in center city delivery could run later but oh well also ive ordered their panzerotti three times it has been different three times but good dopeity dope .
never go to t his place again！！ too salty！ not as good as suggested i was forced to pay more than 20 tips！！！terrible！ .
amazing bbq chicken pizza this is the best pizza in philly generous with the toppings large size prompt delivery i highly recommend this place no complaints whatsoever .
i just dont understand why people waiting in a 2 even 3 hrs line just for those noodle it is just so so and does not deserve such a long time waiting .
go here if you like gourmet pizza 2 5 to 4 per slice try the focaccia pizza .
rude and arrogant overrated of taste and service server didnt wait for us to read menu kept pushing the order ask more tip worst restaurant experience in nyc .
without a doubt the best pizza in philadelphia only draw back are their wonky hours closes at 8pm and closed completely on sundays craziness also while their brother location j js is good dont be fooled its not the same .
the reception a lady was very rude she didnt let people standing under the roof despite the rain outside as she claimed to need extra large space for her to check out the sign up sheet .
its on a nondescript street which has nothing going for it but come in for a slice its so good its just absurd .
the food is decent however the wait was ridiculously long i ordered a totto miso ramen topped with pork to be fair the broth and noodle werent that good compared to ippudo the broiled char siu pork was good though .
this was a perfect late lunch the atmosphere is warm and inviting and our waiter could not have been more wonderful lovely glass of chianti and incredible pasta cant wait to return .
not worth waiting in line for hours .
love the food love the service this quaint little place in little italy is one of my favorite places to go the decor makes you feel at home the waiters and the owner are very welcoming the food is delicious .
i dont get it why wait for an hour here maybe my palate is not as refine as others but i think this place is over rated big time .
small place in little italy but the food was amazing we had to wait a few minutes for the table but it was worth the wait we had the 13 lunch special which included salad pasta large portion and chicken parm worth every penny .
yeah whatever i didnt like it so no i will not wait for this ramen i dont mind waiting for good food but eeeeeh .
my family had a wonderful meal the service was friendly and helpful looking forward to visiting soon again .
suffice it to say i live next door this business is the worst neighbor that we have they cant control the crowds they have which is part of the experience of dining out this restaurant seems to attract the rudest people in nyc .
had the stuffed shells and they were amazing i wanted to check out little italy and decided to stop here totally worth it .
ok food subpar environment not worth the wait time i will not try it again even if there is no line there are many more better ramen places in nyc .
this place was very good some of the best italian food i have ever had the waiters were very efficient and friendly i honestly have to say though that food was to die for .
the wait and un friendliness of the host does not outweigh the food just because your place has a line out the door doesnt give you the authority to be mean to the customers who have questions eventually they might stop coming back .
great location the customers are awesome food was very satisfying the neighborhood ladies were in for their sunday night dinner .
food was great but sitting at the bar and watching the cook in the front eat from the spatula pick his nose and other disgusting things just grossed me out will probably never go back this changes my mind of sitting by the stools next to the cooks .
good food nice atmosphere really nice staff jimmy is a nice guy good group of locals go there too .
overpriced and very rude .
we stopped in for lunch to get out of the summer heat it was the correct decision benito ones 12 95 lunch specials are delicious and a great deal three courses i had a salad rigatoni bolognese and chicken parmigiana all were delicious .
i gave 2 star isnt because the food was bad just i dont like it too strong taste soup is too greasy me and friend waited for more than 1 hour to be seated anyway nice try .
the food was really good and the wine was very reasonably price overall satisfied just beware of the small man who comes in and takes pictures while youre eating its a super cute idea until he comes back with a polaroid and demands nine dollars .
chealth grade rating and i found a cockroach in the bathroom .
everything we ordered was delicious the staff were great we cant wait to come back on our next trip to nyc .
not worth the wait in my opinion toki underground in dc has far superior ramen i also felt that our server was ridiculously rude .
yummy italian food and nice small quaint restaurant in little italy clean bathrooms too bonus .
i am japanese and people i am telling you this place does not make ramen they serve chicken noodle soup .
couldnt have asked for a better italian dinner in little italy felt legit nontouristy service and food were impeccable we will be back each time we are in the city .
i think there success went to their heads this place is sooooooo no longer worth the wait in fact it was pretty bad the last night we were there .
my spaghetti and meatballs were amazing we also got the gnocchi and the garlic pasta both were great too the yelp ratings are true .
this place has a c sanitation grade i think that says enough i wouldnt wait outside for an hour to eat somewhere that barely passed health inspections .
absolutely loved this place the owner goes out of his way to make sure every guest is taken care of the food was quite good as well lots of choices and reasonable priced they do a great job highly recommend and will be going back .
who would wait 2 hours to eat at a restaurant that got a c on its sanitary inspection ew forget about it .
cute little place with good food i loved the ambiance of this restaurant it felt warm and inviting we had a little bit of a wait for our food but it was good i wasnt too adventurous getting just the spaghetti pomodoro id definitely go back .
extremely rude service .
great food the real deal nice people that work here we have been here several times over the years and keep coming back always good .
half full restaurant and they asked me to stand outside in the rain until my friend arrived i can go else where and get better for cheaper and the waitress was super rude about it .
sauce was delicious sat outside and the atmosphere was great service was fast and staff were friendly i got the linguine with eggplant parmesan and my boyfriend had spaghetti with meatballs both dishes were delicious and i was really impressed with the sauce .
cant believe this place had such high reviews lol went here offered the tuna nicoise salad and got canned tuna from a restaurant lol my review will end there because thats enough to get two stars .
cant get meat ravioli in a lot of places these days i had it here and it was great cool place also used in the sopranos with great atmosphere and equally good food cant go wrong .
service sucks took 20 minutes for our order to even be taken never got the coffee i ordered asked two times food came and never checked on us had to ask to refill coffee had to ask for check wont be back .
great food great service its well reviewed for a reason fantastic staff gave me a couple of free glasses of wine and a chair so i could sit on mulberry st and wait for my friends to arrive and happily moved my reservation back until friends arrived .
i ordered a mediumrare burger with salad instead of fries and a diet coke i got a mediumwell burger with fries and a tiny bottle of diet coke 6 5 oz all for 18 not going back .
the food was delicious and fulfilling .
i went there for diner and was unpleasantly surprised the service was mediocre the diner was just fare the menu was tired and they would only accept cash .
excellent italian food everything we tried tasted home cooked and delicious i especially recommend the gnocchi it is wonderful .
the waiter had little knowledge of the menu the food was boring maybe they were having a bad day i dunno .
black linguini with a ton of seafood excellent pasta dish and who is the genius that thought up calzones made with puff pastry you wont be disappointed a little pricey but portions are huge service is good clean establishment .
ok food lovely garden .
never had italian food the good it was heaven in my mouth service was excellent and friendly .
i guess i should have ordered the pancakes then maybe i would understand all the hype this place was very meh to me service was quick and courteous the place is cute the food was just nothing special .
went to benito one for my birthday very intimate space the owner came out to greet all of us great service delicious food good italian wine selection but most of all i love how we were given special attention .
i have to give their brunch a yech everything comes with french fries gross and they wont do substitutions but they will charge you extra for some wonderbread toast .
small place but the staff makes you feel comfortable good food i had a spaghetti with meatballs good sauce pasta cooked al denti deserts well they only had carrot cake i did not tried it looked too old i would certainly come back .
decent food but way way overpriced avoid this place like the plague on weekends its too popular for its own good .
old school joint on mulberry street in little italy great food great staff and reasonable prices interior feels like something out of the godfather cool spot .
i think they crunched up a granola bar for my granola and fruit totally unacceptable perhaps another menu choice would have made the difference .
great spot small italian place in the heart of little italy knowledgable wait staff cannelloni was tasty and it felt like a true italian experience i would go back reasonably priced over lunch time about 20 a person including tip .
i was served a raw steak enough said .
extremely delicious broccoli rape steamed clams veal parmesan and and octopus salad very cozy nice staff not pretentious we loved it no reservations and great place to finish off christmas day in nyc .
this place is a great dissapointment the food is just horrendous restuarant itself looks pretty nice from outside decor is modern but please do something about your food even my 5 yr old nephew can make better fish .
attentive service gluten free penne gf appetizer offered when bread served lunch special was generous for the price .
waiter was rude hostess looked at us like we didnt belong here beautiful day outside and happy hour is only indoors no thanks the piedmont pear drink tasted like medicine cough syrup for 13 just overall letdown do not waste your time here seriously go discover princeton .
very authentic italian spot in nyc i highly recommend the ricotta mozzarella ravioli with vodka sauce the wine here is so cheap here 24 for a legit bottle of italian wine most places around here will charge you over 12 for a single glass .
not a fan noisy crowded expensive jammed in i had the fish and chips that i usually get at triumph i wish we had gone there i love the decor though .
service was excellent the mixed seafood platter grilled shrimp mussels fried calamari and clams was really good .
i take it back the service is brutal place is empty on a fri night andhad to go to the bar to get our drinks i suppose probably exactly what you would expect from a mall restaurant .
i went there during the san gennaro feast it was great a the fettucini bolognese i had was delicious if you cant decide on a place in little italy then go here even during a busy feast night the food and service was great .
very disappointing the food was drowning in oil and the sea bass was small and cut like a fillet maybe it wasnt even sea bass service was mediocre and when we brought it to the managers attention she apologized but couldnt do anything for us .
the food here was fantastic the calamari and pasta were very fresh the lunch special is a lot of food for 12 95 so come hungry we really enjoyed it .
this is going to be the shortest review ive written horrible horrible horrible skip on it go elsewhere it will hijack your wallet and feed you seafood excretion in the form of a delicacy thats all kthanksbye .
amazing super intimate and really great italian food exactly what you would want from a traditional italian restaurant big servings great quality and lots of options definitely would go again .
fish did not taste fresh muscles were over done the drinks were just ok waste of money and waste of time another disappointment in the princeton area .
such a cute little place we just randomly hit up while walking through little italy the service was spectacular and the staff was beyond friendly went there and got the lunch special soup pasta and chicken park and was very impressed definitely worth checking out .
food was passable but i have had bettter fish at considerably less cost my glass of wine was very overpriced at 14 and was not good i will pass this place up even when i am visiting lenscrafters .
good restaurant in the touristic spot of the little italy great surprise .
the fish is generally fresh but not prepared well the red snapper in particular was overcooked and almost unedible when we said aloud that we thought the fish was generally overcooked the waitress who overheard us said she agreed .
i have always said that i hate italian food but this place made a believer out of me with the wonderful food service and atmosphore .
tried this place a couple times with friends the bread pudding was good but everything else was unremarkable service and decor are tired and dated .
great place and atmosphere service was great and food was delicious the chicken valdostano was awesome .
drinks and food were overpriced and the food menu was absurdly boring dont see a reason why i would come back with so many better options in nyc .
service was great the food was delicious would definitely recommend .
food and service were both decent but prices were steep for what it was maybe thats just midtwon seems like a cute restaurant from the description but its about half bar with a tv with a partition separating the tableseating area .
the service is awesome they make you feel at home the calamari and chicken parmesan was very tasty our friends had the seafood dish and they it was seasoned just right and our server diego was so accommodating you cant miss with this one .
decent to pretty good food somewhat pricy a very unfortunate lack of expedience in terms of service .
went here recently with a date very cute intimate restaurant the wait staff was a little rude but very attentive the food was delicious i had the chicken parm very generous portion size and the vegetables were very fresh i would definitely go again .
not happy attitudes were horrible food was not fresh .
benitos is the perfect little italy experiencecozy intimate friendly italian speaking staff classic italian menu excellent bolognese ragu very small come late .
they include 20 tip in the bill what if im not happy with the service since when tip is forced for a couple since when the default tip amount is 20 .
pasta was great and service was super friendly .
this restaurant close to my girlfriends place was pretty empty on a weekday but the service was pretty poor and i was not very impressed with the food not the worst dinner i have ever had but i dont plan in going back anytime soon .
the food here is fresh and bursting with flavor the bruscetta and calamari are recommended on the appetizer menu the pasta dishes are wellcooked and the portions are generous unlike a lot of other restaurants in little italy the prices here are fair great place for couples .
pretty good not great i had fish and chip crispy but greasy my husband had fried chicken it was also crispy but chicken was tough and dry the place was very clean and decor very tasteful but all in all a fair experience .
everything i wanted in a restaurant in little italy small dark great food and company service was excellent surprisingly some of the best calamari of all time bruschetta was fresh roasted garlic and fresh herbs and spices complimented the dishes beautifully .
with fly and mosquito flying around the burned brussels oily potato fries and overcooked fried chicken can not match its price .
great food had the lobster special and a great bottle of wine this was in little little italy i didnt get the warm an fuzzy feeling at first but then the servers warmed up and the meal was delightful .
way over rated on yelp my lobster mac was tired and my wifes salade nicoise was the worst shes had should have stayed home .
a little touristy but the food and service are fantastic and they dont charge extra for glutenfree options .
good food questionable sales tactics for orders to go due to inaccuracies on the online menu ill return but they really should take care of their administrative details first .
delicious but for the price the portions could have produced more leftovers .
food was terrible do not get the tasteless veggie burger or over battered fish and chips veggie burger needs new patty restaurant also needs to work on service .
good food not fancy but just like mamma cooked on sunday .
excellent wait staff great location and atmosphere food not so much we waited an hour for a reuben i could have prepared better myself and three mediocre fish tacos i hope the kitchen becomes as good as the front end staff .
i go about twice a week for my coffee besides the coffee always being so fresh it is great to be greeted at 630 am with a smile makes the start of your day even better .
the city tap house has a great atmosphere and an awesome beer selection however the food is really not that great however i am not sure who goes there for food particularly nevertheless there are many more places with better food and an equal beer selection in philadelphia .
breakfast was good but the real review is on the staff they couldnt be any nicer from the girl who took the order to the gentleman who brought me the order to the table customer service is what brings me back a good attitude goes a long way .
the beer was very good but the food namely the mussels not so much check here for more detail phillyphoodfindsandfolli… .
wow always a smile and great service especially the manager mike the staff really goes out of of their way to make you feel welcome bagels and sandwiches are always fresh and the prices are fair .
i gave an additional star because the general manager of the restaurant exhibited an impressive amount of concern and attention to the issues i mentioned in my post his professionalism and customer service warrant an extra star .
its a new location so everything is modern kept nice the different sandwiches ive had so far have been good i need strong iced coffee when they first opened it was brewed to perfection now i find it to be a bit watered down .
terrible service from the bartenders there were 2 very rude and unpleasant women behind the bar on saturday cheer up ladies a smile never killed anyone .
had a few beers and a cuban sandwich at the bar good food and friendly bartenders a nice surprise ill definitely go back again next time im in the area .
way too expensive not that impressive for the location locale of this restaurant the beer menu is long but not as impressive again for the location locale of the place for soso food expensive beer menu its not worth the price tag .
great little happy hour goin on here til 7 we had a shot and a great beer for 8 each that plus an order of the bacon wrapped dates made for a perfect happy hour .
go here for the beer skip the food .
staff here was awesome and friendly the atmosphere was quiet but still alive and service was quick .
average food and their beer is over priced do yourself a favor if you like beer and walk to market get on the subway and go to monks or eulogy .
warm friendly environment eli the bartender is great to new customers i walked into an empty bar that i never been to and really enjoyed it my wife with some help from eli found her easy and enjoyed a great panini .
this ad says they open 1010 its a lie after calling and confirming a lunch and driving 2 hrs to get there they say we only serve dinner not going back thats for sure .
the counting room is definitely one of my goto places in williamsburg they have a great drink list the staff is always friendly and i love the floor to ceiling windows .
too americanized food over sauced and acidie there are better options around .
stopped in this place after a day of shopping and wandering to catch some of the olympics and have a beer there was a bluegrass band playing and the place had a great open air environment perfect summer afternoon .
racist and elitist ate there a while back great food everyone looked how do i say this kindly similar the table system is designed to keep any minority out i will save my money and fly to italy .
spent quite a few hours here the other night a lot of traffic but not too crowded early on as the night when on that changed drastically awesome bluegrass band on saturday afternoons and they have a bag of warm croutons as a bar snack yum .
we came quite late to this place the restaurant was completely full like usual we ordered some jack daniels served in the chepest glasses you can ever find thoes 2 stars goes just for the way how they use to serve alcohool food coming soon .

we had dinner in the restaurant and it was so good we had take out from there tonight and for what we paid not good wont happen again .
great place for an afternoon beer a snack and some people watching from the big open windows .
it was just ok nothing special and overpriced 14 burger and an extra 2 for cheese 2 bacon 2 for fried egg the smoked chicken was smothered in pea gravy and a pound of butter might have a heart attack tonight meh .
i have lived in the neighborhood for 9 years and watched this great bar grow they have simple tasty bar food thats fresh the drinks are proper and the staff and owners get it great space all around .
prices are a bit high they serve brunch until 4pm which i thought was a bit too long from the brunch menu got the toad in the hole pretty decent meal didnt match the price too well and there is a 20 minimum for cards hence the meh .
super sexy space chorizo chocolate dessert truffles and craft beer b .
its just what you would expect to find at a convenience store on north st the people inside are local the food is overpriced and it is not particularly clean my friend charlie once cut his finger nearly off while working the meat slicer there bon apatite .
im still biased but the food is now much better still just bar snacks mind .
food is meh however i like how they offer to make the garlic rice wit brown rice super awesome staff and cute delivery boy .
delicious friendly moreorless moderately priced and next to brooklyn brewery i call that a win .
what can i say this place is always closed and never have what i want disappointing .
good cocktails cheesy music in downstairs area great cheese sandwiches .
had a similar experience to d s this place must be astroturfing votes on yelp i had the tofu spinach grape leaves and soup all were tasteless at best and inedible at worst service is mediocre and slow .
lovely interior great service solid drinks cool area what more could you ask .
visited this restaurant in hopes of tasting the best oxtails it was flavorful but nothing out of this world just like visiting any hispanic restaurant .
cool setup cool place cool bartenders ok on the prices i would say one of the better spots in williamsburg .
the cuban coffee was great other than that food was just ok although large quantity and priced right thats coming from someone whom is hispanic and eats the food .
youve pretty much got me when your decor includes beautiful reclaimed wood went here for brunch when it first opened and service was till feeling itself out but the french toast on a stick and bacon infused liquor cocktail were a must .
definitely not worth the drive from the bronx 15 min traffic free drive at that very overrated the appetizers were good croqueta and yucca rellena ropa vieja was ok hardly any rice and a bucket of beans .
great oldies music amazing classic deviled eggs decent wine selection but i have to admit the crowd is a tad timid .
the sushi was good but the atmosphere and service left a lot to be desired there were fruit flies everywhere .
a new cute cafe vienna on nassau street a bit pricy but food is very good and service is excellent .
love the dumplings with wasabee really good great decor didnt get to hit the karaoke maybe next time .
authentic austrian meats and cheeses with generous cups of real euro coffee fresh viennese breakfast pastries unavailable anywhere around brunch priced at 15 is a great deal for this quality definitely recommend for something different .
came here the other week dont think ill ever come back due to lack of service and cleanliness we are eating raw fish right .

nice place good coffee great floortoceiling windows friendly staff pastries include apple streudel and black forest cake .
didnt care much for the restaurant the food was very mediocre and the waitress had an attitude after i told her thats not what i had ordered she didnt apologize or tried to replace it im not going back there again .
stumbled upon this little grill while shopping on 5th ave decided to give it a try after looking at the outside menu i got the jane burger and my mom got the bbq burger both were delicious the fries were seasoned great and the onion rings were mediocre .
i must admit that the price is really good and the food was also quite tasty it is still not worth waiting over 30 minutes to get served this place seats 30 people with only one waitress .
this place is crazy i dont have the time to try everything but the bbq burger i did have was outstanding the burger was cooked perfectly and the fries were above average i think i might order a spinach steak salad if im in the area again .
非常糟糕的服务！等了超过一个小时菜还没上。very bad service the dish didnt come after more than one hour .
tried the mango burger and it definitely did not disappoint really tasty hot fries but the onion rings werent a fresh batch and werent very hot my brother tried a graso classic burger and really enjoyed it tastes real or homemade .
charged me an extra 10 dollars tip this place is not a restaurant its basically a bar that serves food you can skip it .
do yourself a favor and go now im a burger lover so for me to say this is the best burger ive had in nyc is a big deal the classic is 7 25 and its a steal so incredibly good their fries are great too .
i really wanted to like this place but the food was just ok and it was very expensive many better french spots around including balthazar jules bistro and schillers liquor bar i will not be back .
breakfast is fantastic huge omelets hot coffee prices are fair prefer you to pay in cash .
interesting menu ok french onion soup 6 wine happy hr 57p rude and kind waiters .
burgers are amazing my coworkers are hooked for weeks now every burger is top notch bbq burger is my favorite .
sat at the bar for 10 mins without service looks kinda grungy went across the street to pour george .
got the veggie burrito bowl w mango chutney and guac amazing my friend got kimchi burger bun was super fresh meat good love it .
i didnt even stay it smelled like last nights booze and definitely is not the kind of restaurant you would want to sit down and have a meal at unless you were wasted .
were visiting from baltimore and found this fantastic family owned and operated charming cafe style grill in ny using the yelp monicle feature great food very nice people working there and great prices a must try in ny .
this restaurant is overrated the wait staffs are overfamiliar not friendly they look uneducated like dropouts of high school i ordered duck leg confit it was absolutely precooked they served bread after duck leg confit entree was served .
omlette 2 was delicious and good value great service wish we could eat lunch too entrees smell awesome .
inattentive and slow service understaffed in the kitchen overcooked pork and trout .
amazing sandwiches butter baked buns medium grilled patty rosemary fries are really well done .
loud crowded service was subpar we ordered oysters and some clams but both were so fishy and so much shell pieces in them that we didnt finish didnt order other dishes and just left will not go back .
very tasty fast and an okay price .
uncomfortable crowded flustered waiter very disappointing loud and terribly hot inside waiter was off his game food was average except for the fried clams which were great for the four of us who dined here .
came in on a whim from grand central and it blew my mind the burgers are amazing especially the bbq burger amazingly fast service 5min and a good deal 1010 would eat at again .
food was very overpriced for what it was 14 for one crab cake service wasnt amazing had to clean the restroom myself which was even less amazing tuna burger was decent but thats about it .
had the picante burger meat was tasty bun was hot great burger and fries decent price .
the crabs in fish are so bad we ordered one dozen and there half of them we can not eat it and three crabs are black color even that the waitress said it is fine she even said the bad crabs are not exchangeable so bad experience .
you can eat upstairs with a straight ahead window view the salmon was great and the burgers are really good this is definitely a place ill visit when i visit new york again .
food was okay nothing to write home about the service was atrocious there are plenty of other great restaurants in the area do not waste your time here .
the food was awesome i had a grilled chicken with mango chutney on a chibatta roll so delicious .
food is gross very salty will never return here again .
the office just ordered lunch from graso grill we got six different things and everyone loves everything add to that reasonable prices and fast delivery and you have a winner we will be ordering from here again a lot .
bad service oysters just ok horrible cocktail sauce very hot no ac and its 85 out side dirty tables not cleaned .
tried to go to the burger joint at 230 but the wait was one hour walked to graso good bbq burger and rosemary fries .
tasteless oysters and snotty waitress dont bother coming here .
perfect place to grab tasty cheap and homemade real food glad to have found this place .
horrible service the waitress was quite rude and the other was clueless the allyoucaneat crabs are a complete waste of theres no meat in the crabs .
i love this place the food is soo good the burgers are the best cooked just the way you like and the customer service is top notch and on point i hope they stay this way because im going to continue to come back .
crappy tapas bad service ibiza in new haven or hamden is much better in any way you can think of the city of barcelona should sue them for defamation new haven has much better restaurants .
really great spot for lunch came here with a colleague and both of us thoroughly enjoyed our bbq burgers our orders were ready rather quickly despite it being busy for lunch there is additional seating upstairs which is also a plus i will definitely return .
large selection of vegetarian and nonveg options buffet amazing fried fish .
loved it clean great customer service quick and delicious breakfast bagel with bacon omelet 1 and 2 coffees for 14 32 .
such typical frozen yogurt filled with sugar and so easy to overindulge tastes good sure but nothing interesting here cant believe they are lasting so long in burlington .
delicious sandwiches burritos and vegetarian options not crowded at all right off of the beaten path on a saturday in the summer at lunchtime had a chipotle chicken burrito hm sandwich with gouda and vegetarian hero a bit warm inside .
just walked out after sitting at the bar and being blatantly ignored for 15 min wasnt busy wont be back .
best lunch spot ever if you could marry a restaurant i would marry graso grill .
cute space but every wine ive had there was just terrible .
very good fd excellent service burrito is great and so are the burgers and fries nice and very clean i would definitely come back .
wine selection and service was wonderful sadly the food could be better bruchetta was flavorless .
wasabi burger was just ok no wow factor tasty but needed some salt and pepper maybe bcause there was no cheese on wasabi burger as we all know cheese can make it or break it i will stick with cowboy burger from now on .
not a fan of the ambiance dark random movie from netflix streaming on the tv also had a hard time getting the attention of the bartender that night even though we were sitting right at the bar hmm .
great place for breakfast there arent much of a selection but their food is always fresh and they have a wide variety of food wraps not to mention that the price is very fair here .
food not fresh stay away also not good beware .
everything in here is good and made on point breakfast and lunch for the last to months get the points card its worth when you in here everyday the burgers however the buncher is amazing and french toast and also the burrito are great to .
ordered a simple pomodoro and meatballs for delivery tasted like spaghettios and had a portion big enough for a child brunch has been better but this is a staple dish that you just have to get right .
great burger just open a month a go nice employee so far they serve breakfast too a lot of choices cold and hot sandwiches plus vegetarian sandwiches nice place .
dont know what all of the other reviewers are smoking but this place sucks butt everything tastes like it was just defrosted bland flavorless ew also whats with the tv playing bravo .
the place just opened and serves new burger combinations i have never seen i just had the wasabi burger and besides the interesting toppings the meat was flavorful and juicy definitely coming back for the other burgers on the menu .
we had the osso bucco and the the pumpkin ravioli both were sweetened with sugar which i dislike very much in a savory dish might be better for dessert where that sort of thing would fit .
i just adore pierre loti midtown the staff has mastered the art of being attentive without being intrusive they are courteous wellinformed and thoughtful their recommendations for wine pairings are always good the food is fresh simple and plentiful the filet mignon makes me weak at the knees .
i would love to review this place but they refused to deliver 4 avenue blocks away disappointed .
great collection of wine and good for small eats .
my first and last time here staff was very friendly outside area was a nice idea but there was a lot of trash around the food was awful even the orange juice tasted funny definitely avoid this place for breakfast .
this tiny gem in midtown was so greatvery intimate with mostly neighborhood regulars and friendly staff we had a bunch of different dishes and all were delicious the waiter even gave us some free hot spiced wine at the end of the meal will definitely go back .
this is a very quaint place that has a long history of past restaurants the service is extremely slow and the menu never changes the specials board has had the same specials for almost a year they recently updated their stale dessert menu to a vibrate baker nice .
the best sangria ive ever had very cute place and great service would totally recommend .
the burrata was delicious but the sandwiches were very inconsistent not nearly as happy as the first time i went here .
this was a random find but such a good choice the server was kind enough to charge my friends phone and they even sang for friends birthday good food and great service i recommend this cute intimate restaurant .
so we are basically forced to order another round of drinks and leave this place because someone else has been waiting for the same table a hundred dollars well spent .
despite being alone this could be a romantic spot sangria is perfect for happy hour the risotto balls were tasty and filling i read the review on stuffed calamari but found it bland very attentive service with a family feel .
while the staff is nice once they finally get around to you the service is terrible they had almost nothing in stock that was on the menu and the place was a mess there are plenty of great places in this neighborhood so next time ill go elsewhere .
great selections of wine and cheese awesome happy hour menu will definitely be back thanks kazim for introducing us to our new favorite wine project paso .
poor service average food overpriced .
great find so happy i came in they have a really yummy sangria in a big glass the feel and music of this place is great the stuffed calamari is so delicious the staff is very friendly i will definitely return .
horrible service i had a reservation set for 1pm but they sat us around 2pm didnt take our order for another 30 minutes so by the time we started eating it was around 330pm .
meals are very small although very tasty it is on the pricier side taking into consideration the portions served i recommend to go there for wine and cheese tasting rather than dinning sitting outside is fun and you would enjoy a nice view of some tall buildings .
grilled chicken sandwich is good thats about it .
best place in ny love it especially they have special meatball that we came for it owners are so friendly i definetly recommend this place .
except for beef noodle soup and roast duck noodle soup dont like anything else .
pierre loti is a magical place i went on my first date with my fiancé and proposed to her there the food is excellent the wine list is good but the best part is the atmosphere its a great place for a date .
im not sure what all the hype is about you can order a better sicilian pizza anywhere in south philly for half the price and double the size its okay pizza but i want more than okay when theyre charging 15 on a small pizza .
i had a short break from work and this place was fantastic very quick service and very friendly i will come back again .
its 2013 and you dont take credit cards that means one thing tax evasion come on i am so sick of these restaurants not accepting credit cards you lose more business than you think by not taking them so annoying .
really good tapas place great for dates small place recommended octopus scallops and burger the ownermanager is very accomodating went next door to buy espresso for my date .
i had their pizza at the pizza olympics event thingy here tonight and the pizza was mehhhhh howeverrrr who were the girls at the booth hot as hell bro like omg legit gorgeous do hot chicks work at the 10th st pizzeria belong in maxim duuuude .
great spot came here with a few coworkers and we shared a bunch of plates and a bottle of wine everything was very good and easy to share favorites were the lamb sausage phyllo cheese rolls and the hummus best were the bulgar patties with lamb .
what the hell philadelphia this pizza is not good the crust was bland the cheese was stiff and greasy and the sauce wasnt even worth remembering this pizza reminded me of the cafeteria pizza youd get in high school .
went here last night very nice and cozy atmosphere highly recommend the bronzino it was delicious and well prepared by 9pm the place was packed and very loud one star off for small space and hard to find waiters .
i got the lunch special and the entree and appetizers arrived mixed together in a foil container it was a sloppy mess the food was mediocre and didnt have much flavor needless to say i will not be ordering again .
this place was awesome great location amazing food awesome drinks professional service 5 star everything .
seamless delivery pad thai was undersauced underseasoned and bland wont repeat .
great place for wine especially mulled wine the owner is great to chat with as well .
okay food we started with appetizers curry puffs calamari and taro wontons i enjoyed the taro wontons for the sweet taste everything else was blah .
a great little turkish restaurant its a wine bar with great turkish food served tapas style prices are very reasonable service was friendly and good my only question is why the place mostly filled with ladies a 10 to 1 ratio at least .
apps were whatever food was decent we ordered 3 entrees only was was good maybe it was what we ordered but not really impressed .
i liked the grilled octopus zucchini pancakes and the warm semolina dessert quaint little spot for wine and tapas would go again .
restaurant is pretty but the positives pretty much stopped there service was horrific food was greasy and not well prepared we ordered the dumplings with peanut sauce which were tasty the pad thai was so greasy and the beef in ginger sauce was wayyy overcooked .
highly recommended the team at pierre loti made us feel welcomed and showed us great hospitality the food was excellent and the service top notch next time we are in town wed returned and we definitely recommend .
nice ambiance but wasnt crazy about food yellow curry pineapple fried rice compared to other nyc thai spots .
great wine and tapas place .
we used to order from this place a whole bunch i work on the same street until they served us mouldy tofu and raw chicken not into it .
wow best meal in the usa so far everything we had was excellent melt in your mouth ribs zucchini fritters yummy prawns including the weinstephan hefeweizen on tap excellent friendly hospitality too thanks .
i hate to do this because i like the food here but recently it got a little too authentic a roach joined us for dinner .
nice atmosphere very friendly management staff wine was great perfect place to have a drink with friends would highly recommend this place it is a small space downstairs but i think i heard another group say they had seating upstairs not sure .
the food was a 55 the service was a 15 i have never had service this bad at a restaurant disappointing i will not go back .
huge fan ive been to the midtown location as well as the one in union square extensive wine list and great appetizers great space perfect for date night .
food was ok the service was slow we ate upstairs and it had a weird smell almost like a 1980s peep booth if you can get into carmines definitely go there much better food and service .
great food great atmosphere great service very attentive staff never felt rushed great place to catch up over dinner with friends recommend the phyllo rolls and turkish meatballs .
got the ravioli special ravioli stuffed with mozzarella broccoli and asparagus vodka sauce not that great not worth being called a special or a price tag of 21 .
had a great time here with the miditto meetup great crowd charming intimate setting good food and of course great wine their wine list offers a varied selection mostly great european wines but also a small but strong new world selection will definitely be back .
last night a friend and i ate here it was so loud we could barely hear ourselves think never mind talk and that was upstairs beet salad very bland boring chicken with mushrooms with veggies and potato looked and tasted like cafeteria food not worth the money .
great little wine place we sat outside and ordered a glass of wine and a cheese plate the cheese plate was ok with the regular cheeses like brie and manchego but the ambience was really nice .
the food was good but our waiter was exceptionally the opposite .
love the place people are nice i enjoy their house wine pierre loti which is a nice deal during their happy hour .
worst place in ny i wish i had gone to olive garden there at least bad italian food is cheap .
this establishment has done a great job incorporating itself into our neighborhood and deserves our patronage great wine try their new french house label and beers kazim the proprietor cares about your experience and will make you happy .
so i came here when it wasnt so busy however they managed to take forever to take my order i heard good reviews about this place and wanted to take my father somewhere good bad choice food was decent but not overly great .
this is my goto splurge restaurant its pricey but absolutely worth it for a special occasion everything they do they do well wine food atmosphere is all perfect .
terrible lasagne found a hair in the bread only thing great was the old italian guy serving us .
food was excellent the dishes were italian with and interesting twist i was attending a post christening meal and they graciously opened their doors early to accommodate us the service was excellent unfortunately i live in brooklyn but if i lived closer id eat there all the time .
horrible service snarky people when called to make a reservation after reading on yelp the woman to return my call was snarky and rude we still tried it and the food was average and we must have ended up with our original persons snarky brother .
you can order half servings of pasta dishes this allows you to have two different pastas for dinner or to add one as a side dish to another dinner choice .
must have just closed big construction site now .
great service and great food with a very nice atmosphere what else can you ask for .
tourist trap the food wasnt what real italian food should be .
phenomenal combination of service food and ambience sit on the patio as it is very loud and echolike inside enjoy the landscape and if nick is your waiter you will be delighted food recommendations everything .
13 for 3 small tacos 4 for a small portion of beans that likely came out of a can everything was too salty ill skip this place next time .
very good meal the service food and atmosphere was what i expected very nice experience .
terrible attitude not customer oriented would not recommend .
the food was immaculate and the service was amazing we had the 4course meal and tried a rose and a red wine and every single dish and wine was wellbalanced and delicious i highly recommend this place especially to celebrate a special occasion .
just an fyi that they investors that were backing this place cook solo that also back zahav and percy street have sold it so ummm yea could go either way .
have been here a couple of times and it always has good food and service they have a happy hour on weekdays which is awesome my group of coworkers ordered all the appetizers x2 and they were all great .
if you want mexican food goto to lolita i had the tamal empanadas and parillada the food was not that great also we had to wait over 40 minutes for our food when the restaurant was not that crowded .
i loved the food my only gripe and it is a small one is that 34 for risotto is too much im not it was arborio either it was very good though .
skip this place ordered a large for delivery and received 6 luck warm slices from what were clearly different pizzas i guess it was a plus that they refunded the money for this uneatable disaster but still for the cost you can easily skip and find something better .
this place is first class everything was delicious the grilled octopus and little neck clams were fresh and full of flavor bartender super attentive but not too much love the vibe of the whole place go .
this place didnt do it for us high ratings but both the pho or curry didnt have much flavor .
great ambiance great service we were a party of three with one being veg the other gluten free and the other normal lots of great options for all and the server was knowledgeable of the dishes and ingredients definitely recommended not cheap though .
slow service but a lot of servings .
whenever i travel to see my parents in nj this is a must go it really is one the best food spots in nj highly recommend it .
south philly has much better pho we only stopped here because its a bit more convenient but probably wont do that again the pho was okay nothing spectacular the big problem was the bo kho far too watery instead of being like a stew .
always friendly excellent servers fresh seasonal locally grown veggies and locally procured meats beautiful atmosphere and not terribly expensive whats not to love .
yelp has failed me this time i went to philly to get some authentic vietnamese food not chinese vietnamese food that i can get anywhere in nyc everything was just mediocre i only spent a day there and am very diappointed that i chose this for my dinner .
great atmosphere i had the mushroom gnocchi and pork shank the mushroom gnocchi are tough and tasteless but in a tasty broth the pork shank was really excellent id try it again but likely wait a while .
the food is great the staff is not so friendly and i also didnt like seeing dead fish in their tank .
dinner to celebrate moms 75th birthday the five of us shared a bottle of wine enjoyed each dish the sauces were the hit of the dinner and this passed my mothers desire to have ambiance great food and friendly service we knew that eno terra would .
the last two times i came here it was closed is it really open .
i go there as often as i can afford it dont miss the multicourse wine tasting they always have one gem they bring out wanna impress a foodie bring them here .
just keeps getting worse finally done .
i love this restaurant i had the kale caesar salad which was great and the grass fed beef burger which was delicious their dessert menu is impressive also i will definitely be back .
bad quality food my noodles were brought to me cold then they were taken away for a minute to the kitchen and got back microwaved the food is not cooked to order and it is a waste of your time to eat here .
it was a good dinner .
first time here pad thai was too sweet fit for a dessert and fried rice too oily overall not a recommendation unless you are desperately looking for thai jn the area spring rolls were ok hot sauce should be ordered .
awsome food great service .
montclair thai restaurants joeythai is greater than tuptim is greater than spice ii is greater than thaichef note for some reason yelp does not allow the greaterless than symbol in their reviews .
went there with group from work service great food great food kept coming every single item was great ok so i did not try the pasta course so many items i lost track .
so the food is pretty good here but that is where the positivity ends the wait time sucks and they often get ordera wrong i also do not like how the staff speak to eachother anyway overall i am sure there are better places near by .
its airy with a wonderful ambiance the servers are very pleasant and the service is excellent the food is prepared to let the taste of the ingredients shine i love the 3course lunches and the dinners are also wonderful they have an extensive wine list .
flavorful but their portions are small compared to other restaurants that are less than 10mins away from them .
never disappoints great food and wine list my favorite place in new jersey for a special occasion .
dont bother going here if you have had really good shihkabob before the food is less than ok .
nice restaurant that serves local organic food everything is fresh small quantity with high quality of food we really enjoyed our food and the waiter was attentive and knowledgeable i only wish the portion can be bigger considering how much is charged .
had ordered something similar to a gyro and did not care for it sauce was nasty and the meat was dry would not try this place again .
comes strongly recommendable .
very very dissapointed the food was very dry and completely tasteless had falafels humus and the combination kebab the humus was the only thing that was ok everything else was very subpar to say the least never coming back dispite the reasonable prices .
my wife and i ate here about two weeks ago and it was wonderful although they arent serving their full menu due to the damage sustained from irene the enotecca menu was amazing love the fresh fish specials and homemade pastas .
this place is disgusting there was hair on our tea and when we asked the server to change our tea he was so mad and annoyed at us as if we did something stupid in the restaurant im never going back here again .
delicious and fresh food .
it was terrible we didnt enjoy it at all the waiter didnt understand us and the dishes were horrible the only good thing was the bubble tea store next to it .
wow the best homemade pasta great food romantic and great wine list love it .
i decide to try out this place i order wonton noodle soup it was the worst the soup tasted funny if wanted to call out sick the next please help urself to this place i give one because the took my order was very nice .
see my main review below ive since been here several more times and can now add that their desserts are a little disappointing and not up to the standard of the rest of the meal .
employee are rude talking to them is talking to air they dont say yes or no im not even sure if she heard me so when your repeat she snaps helllllllo im the customer just terrible .
we went here for dinner on my birthday good food good service a little bit expensive but a very nice experience .
the wide noodles are very greasy and one of the older waiters was outright nasty and rude and we spoke mandarin and did nothing to incite vitriol theres no room in there its loud and franklyi didnt enjoy my meal .
fresh and delicious one of my standbys .
service is gruff and lackluster but what makes this place truly awful is the shocking smell of ammonia in the vile noodles avoid at all costs .
the blt beef lamb turkey platter was really tasty crazy selection of add ins roasted peppers 3 different humus options pickled items veggies etc portions are a little too large for a normal meal but you can always take it home best shwarma since my israel vacation .
this place is super cheap asian food it doesnt seem like the cleanest here either the only redeeming factor is its late night hours i couldnt find anything else to eat in the area at 3am .
i cant say enough about how ridiculously good everything is here if youre in the mood for a food orgasm this is the place .
alittle over hyped fried rice is mediocre lo mein pretty awful .
we decided to try a chicken shawarma because there was no lamb available we were not disappointed by our selection the chicken was moist and the wheat pita bread is always fresh previously the lamb shawarma was my favorite it has been replaced by the chicken shawarma .
there are so many better places to go had the lo mein not good bland flavorless i think the best things here is the wonton soup and the steamed chinese veg .
you get a falafel sandwich with your selection of toppings almost too numerous to name for under 5 how can you beat that ive havent had the shwarma but it looks good .
this place was really gone downhill lately was very good but the last several months have been one bad meal after another i used to recommend this place to everyone no more .
delicious fresh and very cheap friendly service and quick as well would come back any time highly recommend .
hunting for cold duck among greasy notaswideaspromised noodles as smell of bleach permeates the air .
just tried sababa yesterday the service was good friendly and fast the food was delicious definitely going back .
msg in the food service is terrible there are better places out there two stars .
outstanding the atmosphere is a corner mom and pop pizza shop with roots back in the homeland but wow can they cook super friendly and attentive waitperson and the meals are amazing try any of the specials of the day and you will not be disappointed or hungry .
the only good things about this restaurant is that it is cheap and open late the food just is not any good or special in any way .
great food great customer service heres my deal i cant eat food at my restaurants because of my sensitive gi tract adriatiks never an issue i love their pizzas i love their gyros and i love their sauces keep it up guys .
not that great the name change is needed .
the food was fantastic we went an hour before closing and everything was fresh the staff was friendly but really the food was good really good .
really disappointed with this place today my noodle soup usually dead on and yummy smelled of industrial cleaner idk if mgmt has changed i will give it one more random shot in the future if it sucks i will have to write it off forever .
great atmosphere and very friendly love coming here as often as possible never had a bad meal beats a chain restaurant hands down for good food and nice attention to detail always nice to find a restaurant where you are greeted on a first name basis .
for brave diners its a decent quick meal .
went back to try the lasagna very good homestyle taste .
nothing special there are about a hundred much better noodle places all over chinatown and they were recently hit by the commissioner of health and mental hygiene with 91 violation points including vermin ewww 167 153 150 32riwebde… .
really delicious homemade pasta dishes the staff is very friendly and it smells amazing in there .
it was pretty crowded so we thought the food would be pretty good it was average at best nothing to really complain about since it was cheap but i wouldnt take anyone im trying to impress there .
had dinner there for first time and loved it the white pizza i had was excellent my wife had the lasagna and it was very good as was her cocolate mousse cake service was excellent very inexpensive .
not impressed with the food or the rushed service thumbs way way down you have a big problem when most of your chinese clients be it from l a or n y gives this awful place less than acceptable reviews go figure .
found the place by accident but very glad that i did the pizza and the service were excellent i will be going back soon .
disgusting some of the dirtiest nastiest food in chinatown avoid at all costs even if its late and youre drunk .
glastonburys little hidden gem with excellent food and service run by a very nice immigrant couple that always remembers my name even if i havent been there for months the eggplant parm is the best ive ever had with just the right about amount of everything .
this restaurant is not bad but not great either had the beef chow fun pork intestine congee and wonton noodle soup for 14 except the dishes were bland and on the greasy side there are bbq items fried ricenoodles congee here .
cute atmosphere the woman who runs it is fantastic the food is excellent i usually get the gyro plate .
i was actually unhappy with this i ordered a beef stew noodle soup it was very unsatisfying something tasted off i think it was the noodles however they give a good amount for a good price 4 but for the flavor id rather elsewhere .
red bliss pizza get one now .
the thinnest no sauce no cheese no taste square pizza i have ever had im italian i come fro a restaurant family and this was truly a waste of time and money .
we love this place great family run restaurant i consider this place glastonburys little hidden gem food is great pizza is hearty and the prices are great the gyros are yummy and they family is super nice to patrons .
never get delivery the lady who works the phones is one of the worst people i have ever dealt with and ive worked in restaurants for almost 10 years she was rude and also wrong the pizza is amazing dine in or nothing .
pretty solid for all you can eat chinese buffet best value for sushi clams and shrimps in town hands down an great place to try a large amount of food .
dont know why this place is rated so high pizza is mediocre and overpriced horrible horrible service definitely not coming back again .
great service great food great atmosphere this is a great restaurant very nice staff and the fries are some of the best in the city .
big disappointment luzzos used to serve good pizza but not anymore now the crust is alway soggy and the service specially the host is rude .
great service great food great atmosphere this is a great restaurant very nice staff and the fries are some of the best in the city .
this place is literally over rated .
lovely brunch menu enjoyed a delicious omelette with squash and kale great attentive service a very neighborhood feel .
luzzos what happened you were once my 1 pizza place in the city friend straight off the boat from italy you are her favorite place the last pizza wasnt at all the same or even good sadly .
very impressed with the brunch nice decoration as well staffs are really nice will come back definitely .
i had high hopes good reviews and i received a glowing recommendation from a friend however i found the pizza to be mediocre plus lombardis delivers to my door which is in another league .
one of my alltime favorite restaurants in nyc consistently delicious fun atmosphere great service .
pizza bland crust sauce lookedtasted like what came w the old pizza kit in a box from the 70s expensive for semiedible cardboard restroom was locked waitstaff ignored my request for them to open it 10 artichoke app was very tasty but very small for the price .
food still great som richard still on top form we had nice st joseph that paired so well with the food .
eh honestly the burgers arent good i would recommend going elsewhere if youre going here for the burger if youre going for drinks and cute waitresses hit it up .
yelp should have six stars reserved for exceptional restaurants like cookshop friendly professional staff excellent food reasonable prices and best of all it isnt in the least pretentious ill be returning soon .
the name is genius the burgers average .
talk about a great experience amazing food incredible humans with amazing service if you come ask for bandit monday at the bar he will take care of you .
came here for the best burger in town and was pretty disappointed the burger was so greasy i had to wipe it off with my napkin and it still dripped yuck the fries kinda sucked too .
i have been here multiple times for dinner and brunch and always find the food to be tasty the atmosphere is enjoyable and not too loud but can be a bit cramped when its busy staff is courteous and helpful and i enjoy the seasonal menu options .
shrimp dumplings bland seafood pan fried noodles slimy fried pork platter greasy and not even a measly bowl of white rice sigh .
solid food i had the duck enchilada which was quite tasty wine was not particularly inspiring .
host is full of it we waited 45 mins for a table of 3 and while people of 56 got tables readily he simple ignored us there were tables not even being used and he didnt offer to split a table with another small group .
excellent service impeccable wine pairing delicious food felt cared for start to finish despite the popularity .
i dont know what happened but this did not live up to the hype why like other elites do not come with a large party and make sure you order the right dish many where hit or miss .
delicious food and friendly service sometimes feels a bit pricey but all in all really like the casual environment if youre meeting up with friends and family would recommend making a reservation in advance as this place can have a bit of a wait .
oops i was disappointed on this one the food was ok nothing to brag about but the service was plain terrible they kept me waiting til i got served and again waiting for the side dish bottom line i say forget about it .
really amazing ginger pancakes the concept was very creative and comforting with gingerbread apples cinnamon and cranberries i also really liked the huevos rancheros and the french toast the breakfast potatoes were pretty bad .
if you wanna overpay for bad food this is your place some of the staff were nice but i wont come back .
delicious and very accommodating for my friend who has a lot of food allergies would definitely come back out here .
their good but their reservation system is terrible we called and some one spoke with us when we got there our name wasnt in the list then we had to wait .
try the new fashioned .
we went to traif for dessert and drinks i wasnt impressed at all we ordered the bacon doughnuts and each had one drink the environment is very fast moving and kind of pushy so we were looking forward to leaving anyways will not return .
very nice brunch place really good food i got the huevos rancheros it was amazingggg so good i will come here kaur for that really cute restaurant .
overrated overhyped .
really good farm to table restaurant in chelsea with very welcoming staff high sense of selection of products from staters to dessert every single dish is always a good surprise .
ok food but rude hipster staff specially the hostessmanager she had a nasty attitude and was completely rude food is good not worth the shitty attitude .
now we had our lunch and it was superb nice waiter quick and i had the trout and it was very good then the fact we sit outdoor at 330pm does of course play a little part highly recommended .
people have raaaved about this place but i wasnt impressed the food was mediocre my fiance claims the brunch is better and maybe ill give it another shot but hell have to do some begging there are much better spots to eat in brooklyn .
delicious brunch spot with a cozy ambience ordered the quevos rancheros with a side of their turkey sausage both were satisfying to the palate if youre contemplating on which side you should get i would recommend the wild hive grits .
very disappointing food nice ambience though this is the ideal spot for hipsters and creative types not for normal everyday life food was below par .
i went for brunch and loved it excellent variety of bloody marys i recommend the bacon one huervos rancheros was excellent biscuit and grits were also tasty beware there could be an hr wait if you dont have a reservation .
everything taste same bread butter bread butter too much grease and trans fat for me .
we ate breakfast here twice everything we ate was above average average in quality and flavor the breakfast menu is a bit more interesting than your average breakfast menu we ate different things both visits and everything was amazing get a side of grits they are so good .
saturday brunch oversalted very disappointed .
the ranchero is amazing i think is better than five points .
a friend had her birthday dinner here so about 10 of us met at traif and had some food .
cool brunch spot make reservations huge line outside right by the highline interesting food pretty solid good drinks .
decor ugly as all hell really starbucks is classier food pretty good small portions nothing earthshattering drinks pretty delicious service 40 minute wait between courses on valentines day .
service and food was off the chart these guys have the recipe for success awesome creative menu and drinks .
dumplings are cheap shrimp boiled dumplings inedible shrimp are tiny and canned to be fair the pork boiled dumplings are good very tiny space filled with rude diners staffers nice as can possibly be within a confined space would not go again .
not bad great patio .
very cheap dumplings however i wouldnt eat here again the dumplings regardless of their flavor are not made properly the proportion of dumpling skin to the filling is completely off the skin of the dumpling is too thick which is a shame given that it tastes decent .
brilliant experience my tomato gazpacho was wonderful just the thing on a hot day the steak was very tender and wellprepared service was prompt and attentive .
overall 2 5 stars very small shop but reasonable price pork and cabbage dumplings 4 5 stars chicken dumplings ok 2 stars shrimp dumplings ok 2 stars egg sesame pancake very oily has egg shells and was ok .
chelsea restaurant with good food and beautiful people i enjoyed my trout and tried my friends chicken dish quite a large portion there the berry pot pie was also yummy good scene and overall a good experience .
not a fan found a small bug in my dumplings which didnt even taste particularly good and the place doesnt even look clean i dont understand what the hype of the place is .
the blt bloody mary is really amazing this place is always full so arrive early at the weekends if you dont wanna wait in line around 1030 am the cappuccino is also really good not so easy to find in typical american restaurants i love the service too .
food was average quality i dont get the hype it is a bargain place hygiene level and organization reflects that .
this is one of my favorite restaurants no matter what you chose on the menu you will not be disappointed start off with the snack menu and work your way through to dessert great cocktails too .
i dont know what the hype is all about it is not bad but definitely not that good either should not be considered the best dumpling in ny .
great spot for brunching try the chilaquiles and let the bartender delight you with their brunch cocktails the wait line is pretty long so make sure you arrive early the best part is its location next to the highline making it the perfect spot to start your sunday .
no good ladies was rude place smells n was a waste of 6 25 didnt even try food would never go back n upset i listened to yelp reviews n really drove there during traffic to try .
fresh food great service celebrity sightings .
cheap yes tasty no many better options in surrounding area dont believe the hype .
had the huervo rancheros for breakfast i was surprise at how big the plate was but all in all the staff is very friendly and pleasant this is my new spot .
the dumplings are good but the size of the store is small and overcrowded good for takeout only vanessas dumpling house is better because they have seating the same menu and a restroom .
breakfast was very delicious scone and biscuit were highlights and the service was great .
dumplings are cheap relatively tasty and filling place is about as sanitary as a bus station restroom in afghanistan choose your fights .
came here for a girls night and loved it food was excellent and mirrored the fresh new american style food ive had in la cocktails are also awesome and the popcorn sundae dessert tastes like caramel corn ill definitely be back .
vanessas dumplings were better this one gives 1 extra for the price but not so good .
lunch here was so great yep just straight up great we walked in without a reservation on a friday afternoon i cant wait to come back here thats it i went you should go .
ew this place is stinky small and unforgivably greasy the dumplings are floppy and soggy they should be crispier with a thicker wrapper the meat inside is grimey and euuuugggh i have no idea why people rave over this vanessas is much higher quality for the same price .
i just looked up squash blossom its a flower i ate a flower and it was amazing cocktails were bad either nice place for a first date or any date will definitely be back .
i dont get it i had the veggie dumplings and they werent very good ive had better frozen dumplings i guess i need to try more stuff but so far not impressed at all .
great brunch food while you are waiting you can get a great cup of coffee at the intelligentsia truck across the street .
very disappointed the reviews are so impressive but we found the dumplings tasteless we left and went to dumpling man a favorite .
i cannot remember if i reviewed this before or not so i will keep this short and say that the food service and atmosphere are perfection wish i had tried dessert but was too full you wont be disappointed by cookshop .
their dumpling is average no seasoning sesame pancake is not crispy very thick like bread no flavor .
really lovely brunch spot first of all the restaurant is very clean and modern bright and spacious usually the brunch menu could be boring but they have so much to offer all come with such pretty presentation service was good server was wonderful and very nice .
very cheap food only for take away i dont suggest you at all to stay there not for european too chinese dont think about whats inside your dumplings and hope to digest them in 5 hours no salt used in the soup noodels kitchen dirty .
wow walking by and caught our eye food was wonderful salad greens didnt need dressing crispy calamari was fantastic and not standard rings my wife had mezza plate which was delicious and i nailed the nicoise tuna perfect piece of fish .
i must be missing something this place is a total dump the people who work there are rude and wost of all the only good items on the menu are the sesame pancakes which are friend food so obviously they are good that you can get anywhere .
good location and atmosphere attentive service great fresh blueberry margarita .
i saw the review and decided to give it a try but it was disappointing to be honest they are better than what they cost but they are definitely not so delicious fried dumplings .
bloody marys are back on track and tasty again theyre still not quite as banging as they were before but still some of the better ones in the city that ive tried this place redeemed itself .
a rating not do not eat at this establishment a huge waterbug was brewing in the soup eeekkkk .
the best bloody mary sooooooo fab .
saw all the great review but this place is gross no wonder the dumplings are so cheap would not go here again .
cookshop is a great place for brunch we had to wait about an hour because we didnt make reservations but the brunch cocktails were on point as where the entrees a tad overpriced but delicious nonetheless try the blt mary for an out of the box cocktail .
oversalted mystery meat in the pan fried dumplings i will be back to vanessas i would be willing to pay much more to not think 200 degrees in a frying pan does kill most everything right .
good food but very small menu it is also very crowded so calling ahead is preferred it can also be a bit loud as a result .
well definitely it was cheap but i did not really like their dumpling i ordered veggie dumpling i will give another shot though i want to try pork dumpling next time .
excellent service and food a neighborhood favorite for lunch as well as dinner .
the dumplings were okay the sesame pancake was okay it was cheap but i wouldnt go back .
love this place gem of chelsea all the boys who work there look perfect and handsome they are also very polite best service the food is exquisite brunches are the best blt bloody marries are the best in town always crowded be sure to order come in advance .
after eating some of the frozen dumplings that i bought from here my boo found a hair in one of them yuck maybe its a fluke but its pretty gross when you think about it .
im not breakfast and brunch person so its hard for me to rate however cook shop have brunch menu thats absolutely delicious i got the poached egg with mushrooms it tasted like fresh farm food loved it .
super cheap but mediocre dumplings filling is just not as flavorful aa many other places in chinatown we went here when the line was out the door at vanessas and wont make that mistake again .
totally packed for saturday brunch but we stole 2 seats at the bar the wines by the bottle are not that great unless you get the most expensive one the food was awesome bartenders were fast and efficient .
after trying this place a few more times i realized this was just an ok place yes its cheap but also not very clean the meat also tastes a little weird if you eat it slowly also a friend of mine got sick from here .
make a reservation or you will be waiting a while the food was very fresh and the bloody marys are amazing .
ehh okay you cant get better than 10 dumplings for 2 but the dumplings are just okay although crispy the meat tastes old and its way too oily good for those on a budget and in a hurry .
bloody mary bellini followed by roasted broccoli cheddar scramble the biscuits are great all was very yummy we just walked in got a table right away on a saturday at 1130unheard of even the decaf coffee was good server was friendly fun a definite recommend .
its ok but not all that the sesame pancakes are indeed delicious and cheap but the main eventthe dumplingsare kinda crappy there are tons of better dumpling houses in chinatown my personal favorite is tasty dumpling on mulberry street .
excellent food and really friendly service i had the eggs benedict and my friend had the cookshop breakfast everything was delicious quick and the restaurant is lovely would definitely go here again .
manager directed employees to release hundreds of new years balloons onto the street for someone else to clean up wherever they land regardless of the food or drink this is a shameful way to run a business .
cool place in chelsea love the food and wine yeah try the famous huevos rancheros and the waiter is very friendly and professional ask them to recommend some good wine for you .
what an overrated unpleasant experience the staff is indifferentbordering on arrogantthe food took forever to arrive and it was at best ordinary forget the hype and go to a restaurant that deserves your business this place doesnt .
probably the best breakfast ive ever had no joke it is a little pricey but it is a must go place great service and a amazing food .
if youre looking to plan a private event do not go here the event staff is extremely unfriendly and short take your money somewhere else .
bloody marys were incredible got the blt mary but they have 6 different bloody options brioche french toast was a custard orgasm in the mouth stracciatella fig appetizer was creamy sweet delicious huevos rancheros was so good and beany needed a bit of extra hot sauce though .
ithis place has the worst brunch service we stood at the bar along with 4 other groups of people who were waiting for drinks for 20 minutes food is okay .
got the bacon burger ate it all .
food was mediocre drinks overpriced service was terrible will not be going back .
lovely clear mushroom soup the trout was perfectly prepared and seasoned though the cranberries and pear were a bit too sweet with it wines by the glass list is short but very well chosen floor staff competent the atmosphere for dinner is dark and buzzy without being noisy .
all hype this place will fizzle soon ps stay away from the pork belly its all fat and you will feel disgusting after you eat it .
ive been to cookshop for both brunch and dinner it has a dope variety of bloody marys and the french toast is to die for the sea scallops are a must for seafood lovers this is a great place to go with a big group that takes reservations .
the only positive thing i can confidently say about this place is that i really liked double crown sp is just another manhattan restaurant and there are plenty of those .
this is a nice place in chelsea good atmosphere very nice service great food good value for money hard to go wrong with this place and definitely recommended .
you fail worst soda i may have ever drunken drank drunk however you spell it it was horrible workers were nuts even the workers were complaining about the other workers avoid go to sbarro or nathans instead .
great food large portions as well .
what do you expect from a rest stop garbage service subpar fast food compared to normal crappy fast food and poorly spoken english .
exceptional meal outstanding service and star treatment after a little twitter mention small plates were delicious main course was prompt well planned and executed incredibly we will be back .
food is good staff have virtually no affect nor communication skills except grunts pepperoni pizza slices were served with remnants of toppings not ordered presumably from nearby slices ew .
great brunch food but absolutely need reservations can feel a bit crowded and rushed as its so busy which isnt what im always in the mood for on a sunday but the food is worth it every now and again .
please do not even bother to go this restaurant its food portion so small that we had go back home and eat again do not waste your money i do not recommend this restaurant .
our favorite restaurant for dinner in manhattan interesting but unpretentious selections helpful waitstaff fun atmosphere always crowded but not teaming i cannot offer enough praise for cookshop a great place to take out of town guests a real taste of nyc .
i tried the special tacos and there was no flavor at all it is a rotating special so could be this platter only my friend thoroughly enjoyed his meal review is for the mahi mahi tacos .
fantastic service food atmosphere and wine recommendations from richard were wonderful thank you ann marie .
boring not worth coming back service was miserable and food was nothing great it was actually tasteless the sangria wasnt even good dont waste your time .
cookshop changed my life my cousins introduced me to pate and charcuterie for the first time and cookshop does it best lifechanging now everywhere i have charcuterie and pate even in paris i compare it to cookshop .
i had the enchiladas verdes con pollo it was decently tasty but i wasnt amazed the rice it came with was quite bland as were the fish taco appetizers we ordered a special that night service was acceptable but not great .
love their beignets and the service has always been impeccable make a reservation for brunch .
i dont know what the hype is about food was meh and service was awful not again .
came here for brunch the food was amazing many of the ingredients are from locals make a reservation way in advance .
black beans very bland chicken in the salad very bland steak salad very very small .
our sunday brunch had great food and service great tastes i loved the huevos rancheros the pastry sampler was unbelievable .
a bit pricey for the portions tasty food from what i remember but i was still hungry after two appetizers drinks and my entree how is that possible .
amazing wine list had the pork chop on a fall night in new york that tasted oh so good with golden raisens and sliverred almonds they play really good music here too highly recommend .
pizza terrible here it tasted like cardboard for a place that calls themselves pizza one the pizza is gross in my opinion they cook everything with way too much oil chicken cheesesteaks should not have that amount of oil all over the bread not good .
lobster salad chicken liver mousse carpaccio fritters and grilled corn were insane everything we tasted was beyond amazing and i would go back again and again fresh organic ingredients that were prepared in truly innovative and creative ways .
i have to refrain from being too mean but i felt that the chicken was rancid everything was greasy and the flavor wasnt there we tried variety of appetizers and general gaus and we couldnt eat it how bad was it our dog turned it all down .
definitely wait to spend some time at this gem on the west side order the grilled cheese .
food poisoning waiting to happen i got a cheese burger and it was lukewarm and the fries were not much warmer and they were chewy the drive through staff was really nice .
came here for breakfast on a saturday had to wait 30 minutes but it was worth it service with a smile and pretty good food .
really struggling here twenty minutes to get our food and not that crowded but the habanero ranch burger was good clean .
best brunch ive ever had i think the sentiment was the same for the entire table good service .
its a local bar mostly locals come here to watch the game though it does attract a younger crowd for the beer pong also not much character for a bar just a place to leave your house to drink .
great farm to table restaurant fresh delicious ever changing menu lovely to sit outside or in also love the cocktail menu .
see the reviews for curtis all american restaurant and bbq be forewarned .
i had a late brunchlunch here and it was worth the wait i highly recommend getting the pastries plus i love that they offer mocktails im a lightweight and can never really finish a bloody mary or a bellini the peach fizz went perfectly with my burger .
tried the mocha latte it was room temperature and not the prettiest looking mocha either i hear the espresso drinks are better when lulu makes them herself delmochavista wordpress … .
unpretentious flavors that u cannot recreate in your own kitchen while it feels like youre dining with family wine in the righteous true tradition of the sport fresh and airy comfort expensive though .
do not order latte the worst latte ever .
great brunch spot expected a little more out of my huevos rancheros but the awesome drinks and outdoor seating make it well worth the trip .
the worst pizza ever please do not waste your money it was oily and hardly edible please save yourself and your money its a complete ripoff in the name of pizza yelp should have a nostar ratings for such businesses .
one of the best brunch spots in nyc make sure to get their take on eggs benedict the mock tails are also out of this world cant wait to come back .
the food was really bad and the place is really expensive for what it serves no salt and condiments in the food the brocoli was like a horror film place looks nice but food doesnt resemble anything i know of italian sorry i wasted the tome and money .
i have my main meal in the morning i like it here i like its country style and portion size food was great .
two words unnecessary attitude that about sums it up for me food is eh wine is good but pours are light dont get it .
we went for brunch one sunday afternoon excellent bloody mary delicious frittata cornmeal pancakes we sat outside the service was polite helpful and we had a lovely time i highly recommend you put this on your list .
i hate giving bad reviews but i couldnt help it i guess the drinks wines must have been good but i dont drink and the food was im not gona say the worst but def not worth it eat anywhere else .
amazing huevos rancheros and i grew up in texas and have lived in los angeles forever my husband said he has finally found the perfect huevos rancheros after a 9 year quest .
dont waste your time food is fair at best even for a dive policies change at the whim of the barminimum for credit cards went from 5 to 10 to 15 .
love this place fabulous warm service very very yummy food reasonable wine list the place is small so you are packed in but the energy is good dont skip dessert .
how can the bongo bar be so terribly underutilized it has a ton of potential but zero atmosphere no music few chairs almost no people the bartender was cool but management needs to walk through there once and do something to fix it .
the cocktails are on point the deviled eggs with salmon roe were killer good bread that comes with your meal my salad was just ok but everything else made up for it .
food was overpriced but very very good the problem you expect superior service in this price range service was inferior .
brunch the go to spot in chelsea .
overpriced touristy the drink was strong bongo mojito but came in a small plastic cup and could have used more ice at 9 50 a pop i am demanding i cant imagine dropping money for food here fun to be on a boat though .
good brunch good breakfast great bloody maries .
three things are required for a good brunch rich coffee fresh oj and real maple syrup york street cafe was 03 and had soso food .
i like to eat at the bar during lunch hours dinners are way too loud and crowded mixed crowd .
friendly service better than zaroka not as good as thali too good price though for the lunch buffet although i went for dinner .
innovative and very good food brunch was very pleasant .
i went here for the lunch buffet and was far from impressed ive had some great indian food in new haven which gave me high hopes but i was sorely disappointed the service was great and the restaurant was clean but the food was bland .
great food very fresh duck sausage was delicious octupus appetizer was tasty some people ordered the pizza looks so good scallops were delicious would def go back for brunch .
didnt really like the service i got in here nor the food art gallery consisted of spray painted store bought action figures or action figures with their heads pulled off and something else glued on selling for hundreds of dollars .
cookshop always goes above and beyond best service delicious food excellent drinks fantastic atmosphere .
used to be good now its just falling apart ripped chairs leaky roof etc so sad to see a great diner go down the drain .
one of our highlights in nyc excellent service and the brunch was delicious place was packed but it was worth the wait .
stay away far far away the service is absolutely atrocious and i have two little kids and now my wife sick with food poisoning what a mistake going here i dont even know how they stay in business .
service was amazing we got seated a half hr after our reservation and were accommodated by 5 plates of appetizers and free dessert the seasonal mussels in sauce is delish .
dont eat here rude angry staff management must be horrible and the food is tasteless i live in the area and there are other places to eat .
great place with good atmosphere try the tuna salad you cannot go wrong here whatever you choose .
terrible place food and service .
seriously the best brunch ive had ever still thinking about it to be honest and i cant wait to go again .
ick walked in walked out .
go for dinner sit next to the woodburning oven the food is locally grown and marketsourced farmtotable yumminess pro wilted spinach pizza deviled eggs with salmon roe seasonal fried artichokes creative drinks nutty cider gin ny staff incredibly warm hospitality thanks for a lovely evening jesse james .
awful we used to come here all the time but most recently it has gone downhill the menus are falling apart tables and seats all in bad shape ordered breakfast the other day and everything tasted of grease including the coffee .
i have always had a pleasant experience at this restaurant i love the concept great wines excellent staff and warm atmosphere .
service mediocre hostess lady is the grouchiest of all food is well typical diner so so get the eggs with toast very exciting .
ive been here twice once to eat dinner outside and once to eat brunch at the bar both times were fantastic excellent fresh food great staff and nice open atmosphere the menu changes all the time so i cant wait to go back .
unfortunately my experience was not as pleasant as the other people reviewing it the waitress was rude and nasty and got our orders wrong .
the normandy duck breast were amazing the whole grilled porgy were amazing as well portions were just right six of us came six of us left extremely full happy thank you for the complimentary minicupcakes .
service is slow and store is often crowdedno where to stand while you wait staff is mostly high schoolers who dont seem to know what theyre doing bagels are okay but not great .
this place was great for a weekend brunch except make sure you make reservations it gets really packed the mac and cheese was fantastic but my favorite was the mushroom grilled cheese delicious .
bagels were mediocre but the place itself was dirty i was surprised to see that maidenhead did not look like it had been given a good wash in a couple of months .
went for thanksgiving day dinner best nonhome cooked tday dinner ever corn bread stuffing was out of this world family style sides made it feel like home one of the best meals ive had .
been here several times and the coffee is consistently terrible and burnt tasting stumptown really needs to discipline these guys otherwise free wifi and good seating in the wasteland of midtown are tisseries only redeeming qualities which add 1 star to what is 1star coffee .
really great restaurant it is a big restaurant but they somewhat manage to keep it rather cozy get there early definitely went for brunch and dinner dishes are amazing ingredients are fresh produce and you can taste it great service .
horrible chicken cutlet horrible french fries horrible fried dough very disappointed .
yummy brunch very similiar to its sister restaurants five points hundred acres so if you like that stylevibe you will likely like this spot too def concur w other yelpers on the huevos rancheros delicious .
i tried this pizza for the first time and thought it was awful it was soggy and very bland i would never order here again .
the food was amazing we need to go back .
you have to have a strong stomach and bring your tums many people really like it but not for me .
a great spot for brunch the cookshop scramble was excellent when combined with the applewood smoked bacon definitely try the grits if you like grits and if you have room or bring a friend try the french toast .
if you like chicken and broccoli with a side order of dirt from when they pulled the broccoli out of the ground then this is the place for you ill never order another thing for this place .
food was great .
i eat here only out of desperation when ive forgotten to get groceries and need a fix of msgs crappy food with zero flavor ask for extra soy sauce unless you have a bottle at home at least they cant screw up the rice .
a tasty fresh meal in a casual atmosphere with good friends what more could you ask for on a lovely fall evening .
waited almost 90 minutes for a delivery after being told it would be around 40 pizza arrived barely warm at best it tasted ok but around here ok is not good enough we wont be ordering from here again .
great brunch spot on the weekends all of their drinks and dishes are tasty with lots of flavor highly recommend the eggs benedict the restaurant is also across from the high line so when youve stuffed your face in food you can walk it off in the park .
decent jersey slice nothing stand out really thinnish crust with a snap to it some sauce halfway decent cheese .
probably one of my favorite little sports the food here is always a home run ambiance is warminviting the staff is so sweet the oysters were a fan favorite in our group enjoy .
underwhelming had been here many years before and it was like a trip to portugal this time while the food was adequate to good this time the ambience was missing and the menu had taken a turn away from portuguese cuisine there are better choices in the ironbound .
i loved cookshop the atmosphere was awesome i loved the clean and simple decor the portions are perfect we went for brunch and i got the the blueberry pancakes they were probably the best ive eaten service was impeccable too i highly recommend cookshop .
the fried calamari excellent the rest not so good freezer burn not fresh even the paella not seasoned properly all on the bottom service was very good and they were apologetic but should never have been that bad to begin with .
the service is superb here food is always prepared with the seasons best produce a fun sit at the bar breezy sunday drinks type of place the bartenders are super creative so just ask if you dont see it on the cocktail list .
i bought a birthday cake here and it was as dry as desert sand didnt care for it and thought it tasted bland turned me off from buying there again .
nice outdoor seating perfect brunch spot will definitely go again .
would have given three except crust was under cooked one of the few places open till 11pm so ordered delivery expect pizza came without any napkinsplates to our hotel room so be sure to ask for these items .
great breakfast good service excellent meeting spot .
the service was fine the prices are reasonable however the pizza was very greasy it is a pizza place in a strip mall what do you expect .
great menu and good service also fun to walk the highline after a big brunch .
we had such high hopes we traveled 1 5 hours to have coal fired pizza we were very disappointed poor service rude left us out in the cold and rain .
i wish there were more than 5 stars for this rest its phenomenal pretty decor excellent service and really high quality fresh food i had a citrus salad with shrimp and i was so sad when it ended definitely a repeat place for sure love .
was told there was an hour wait with empty tables .
seriously good food excellent service i love it when you can totally rely on a restaurant .
here on business food was nothing compared to what im used to in northern nj when we asked for a copy of the receipt she said the receipt paper ran out i would explore other places before going to this place .
ummm you need to go here now the food was fantastic the best calamari squid weve ever had cant say the same for the service but dont let it stop you from trying this gem .
normally i enjoy diners for breakfast but i didnt care for the food i cant speak for lunch or dinner but i dont think i will be back to try it the people were friendly and the service was fast .
tasty food professional friendly service made for a great dinner experience while visiting nyc .
used to go here all the time last time there was a hair in my cheeseburger and the owner couldnt care less and said to me well what do you want me to do havent been back since .
best brunch in new york worth the wait .
not your typical mexican food they have a variety everythings good and theyll make it as spicy as you want lunch time is usually quiet here so best to go for dinner .
creative and changing menu built around what is fresh andor in season not everything is a home run but mostly an excellent experience .
this place eats my ass i reccommend urinating on the floor .
awesome brunch i had a great experience food was delicious and service was prompt and attentive a solid choice ill def be back .
a decent diner for the area i would say that the portions are decent the sevice is always quick and friendly and their spinachfeta omlette is good .
good food and drinks get the devils tea if you like a sweet ginger cocktail and the porgy was amazing if you can handle eating fish with bones in it .
breakfast sandwich was tasty but it came with cheese and there was barely any cheese in the breakfast sandwich we know that you just started your business but you dont have to skimp that much .
pork belly was good location is even better .
i find the service good and the atmosphere quaint but i havent particularly enjoyed the two lunches ive had from there .
simply put great food i didnt get the azadeh after eating i had the leak soup which was delicious steak skewers 5 wow delicious and the american wagyu steak which came presliced and cooked to perfection bravo cookshop bravo .
grilling two pieces of chicken and tossing sesame seeds on it does not make sesame chicken for 16 its empty here for a reason .
this is a fantastic place with great food and wonderful service i highly recommend their hells kitchen bloody mary and you should request james as a server he is simply amazing and makes the experience feel like youre just at home with friends .
i had a miso soup and an alaskan roll the miso soup was cold and too salty the sushi rice must have been old and the cucumber was not peeled the only reason they got a second star was because my server was good sorry newark .
the place was larger and more commercial than i expected it doesnt have the ambiance of market table for example but the food is very tasty and i would certainly dine here again also the wait staff is excellent .
rice here is stale maybe its because its almost 5pm on a saturday i cant expect much after all it is sushi at an airport .
one of the best burgers ive had in the city in a long time .
this place is filthy there is dirt and hair and ants in the shop im very disturbed by the poor sanitary practices of this place the staff let their long hair fly all over the food i would never go here again and the bread was mediocre .
locally sourced seasonal all the things i love really great fish elegant presentations wonderful flavors make reservations for sure nice date place i would recommend the small plate desert you get an assortment of tiny bit sized delights .
the bread selection looked great and the samples were nicely sized although 6 50 for a loaf of bread is quite steep .
it was perfect in every way we had a magnificent and special prechristmas meal .
not so much i thought everything was just ok the goulash was over nothing in a spicy tomato based sauce dish looked like soup the place is creative with their seating since theres no room no heat either .
make a reservation ahead of time the food is awesome and the bloody mary selection is great .
went there once for the buffet never going back food was just not good .
fresh organic menu which changes regularly the drinks are fantastic and the brunch is divine i highly recommend you make a reservation showing up can leave you waiting 45 minutes getting a reservation here is not hard .
nice ambience but the food is a total disaster my grilled cheese looked terrible and tasted worse the soup was most likely poured from a campbell coup can dont eat at this craphole dump .
great service and ambiance simple and scrumptious great company great food the perfect stop after a highline tour .
i can only comment on the breakfast food but the place seems to do extremes well i first tried the quinoa hot cereal surprised to find that it was disgustingly sweet next i tried the oval smoothie which was super bitter at least the tea was good though .
im always happy after leaving this place and the bloody marys are off the hook .
customer service was horrible management needs to train staff on how to treatserve people i would not recommend this place to anyone .
i have been here for both brunch and dinner the menu is always different because they use a lot seasonal ingredients food is generally good make a reservation this place gets packed .
2 75 for a large cup if coffee to go really at least serve a decent cup of coffee it tasted like a burnt coffee in an old style diner will not go back with these prices and poor quality .
relaxed atmosphere and food food my chicken salad today was very very good no complaint from anyone around the table of 6 .
adequate at best i dont know how this place lasted in bayonne as long as it did food was ok but did not feel fresh soup was more watered down than stock service was fair not a must see .
good almost too filling huevos rancheros very tasty mushroom frittata respectively strong unlimited coffee with 5 sugar options kinda crowded and loud as expected in chelsea everyone had giant bloody marys with giant celery sticks to be tried next time .
bad service food was not good .
our waiter james was only surpassed by the exquisite food i have nothing but praise for all three courses i savored my two dining companions were blown away as well all i can say is just go .
recently i ordered from this restaurant and doubt ill go back again the lady did not give the right amount of changes back when paid my food .
huevos rancheros amazing egg sausage sandwich amazing .
this place is over rated if you think chinese foods are too oily well this place is the mother of oily foods ever heard of heart attack burger in vegas this is heart attack asian foods in chinatown if you wanna live longer stay away .
this is a pretty good place nothing amazing but then again not a dump either i had the scallops which were quite good not an extensive menu but everyone at my table was very happy with what they ordered .
this is asian food for white people no offense bland tasteless uninspired and certainly not authentic .
bar staff was very friendly we enjoyed the tomato soup and eggplant appy we enjoyed it so much that we went the following night again for dinner with 6 others everyone enjoyed the atmosphere wait staff and the freshness of the food .
i have definitely had better malaysian food the pineapple rice and the noodle chicken dish was okay at best and the roti wasnt very good the coconut juice was really yummy though i wouldnt recommend this place .
love this place i have never dined here but their fantastic and unique cocktails keep me coming back the warm bread pudding is also out of sight i like coming over on weekdays as the weekend can bring on a circuslike atmosphere they get very busy .
super oily and completely lacking in flavor im bot sure what all of you see in this place but it is completely sub par compared to everywhere else ive been in china town my mouth tastes like msg bathroom had hand sanitizer in the soap dispenser .
the cookshop has excellent food went here on a whim and absolutely loved it great atmosphere as well good for large groups or a date the tables are wooden and chunky love .
this place is disgusting flavorless oily food run away i feel nauseous from consuming this garbage .
first time for dinner there will not be the last great space wonderful food great vibe gets a bit slow when it gets busy but whos in a rush oysters were fresh and a great selection nice sides brunch is still king but dinner close .
pretty underwhelming id like to believe we just came during an off time so i would be up to trying it again its not that the food was bad it just wasnt notable i barely cared to write this .
i cannot say enough about cookshop but the real reason i go is pastry chef amanda cook shes a wizard .
if you have more americanized tastes you should probably skip this restaurant lots of bones in meat and odd meat products like shrimp wrapped in chicken skin perhaps this is a cultural thing but dont say you havent been warned .
adore .
i dont know why this place has such a high rating i thought the food was mediocre some dishes were a hit but more than some were not family style asian restaurant clean crowded good for big groups .
really great food i especially appreciate that they have only a few options on their menu plenty of themi just dont like being overwhelmed with choices at a restaurant but all the ones ive tried are excellent loss of one star because its pretty pricey .
used to be a lot better the fish head vermicelli was a horrible experience its actually fish nugget noodle soup .
cookshop is a staple on our brunch list atmosphere is simple lovely comfortable service is good not great sometimes a little hectic brunch menu is basic but everything weve had fritta french toast with marscapone cookshop scramble all delish solid bellini and mimosa and decent coffee .
spicy pad thai .
really fresh and crisp food i had a salad and a soup yum right across from the end of the hiline park on 9th i believe .
stay away if youre a vegetarian seriously theres nothing for us here the roti canai was quite disappointing as well .
ive been to cookshop a few times over the past six months and each time im glad i went the food is always solid drinks are inventive and delicious and the service is friendly and helpful great for a date or dinner with friends ill be going back .
hainan chicken is a complete hoax not marinated at all just plain unflavored steamed chicken what a complete joke what happened to you nyonya .
one of my favorite brunch spots in the city a little bit of a wait never hurt anyone right you cant go wrong with their menu and the outdoor seating welcomes the cool chelsea air while you and your friends enjoy yet another boozy brunch .
i just got back from australia where i was feasting on laksa i had a huge craving and got the asam laksa here what a terrible disappointment it isnt even close the other foods are good but the laksa is an epic fail .
food is great and very sceney for its location the place does get really loud when its busy but a great place to go before heading out on the west side .
they charge tax and they do not accept credit card why .
hands down my favorite bloody mary in the city i love sitting at the bar and always come to cookshop for brunch a must go .
40 minutes for a take out order on a slow night and no apology so rude .
perfect summer brunch spotor any time of year for that matter ive always had a pleasant experience both with service and food if you plan on coming for brunch be sure to make a reservation or be prepared to wait .
very disappointed this is not truly malaysian cuisine its more like asian restaurant tailored to foreigners .
love it what more is to say that has not been written just go have brunch eat and enjoy do not be afraid of the brunch pizza it is so yummy and flavorful .
food was a bit disappointed dont think we will go back service was slow but one thing they r good at was how fast they give u the check event when u r not finish .
me loves me the cookshop ive been going here for three years now and i just went again last night its gotten even better came down from the highline and grabbed a last minute bar spot cocktail menu is superb and check out the cheesewine pairings .
much needed deliver midway through biteoffmorethanwecanchew furniture staining project eh blah definitely could be better .
love it when great places take reservations on opentable love it more when the place has a delicious inventive menu with a banana split sundae to boot a goto spot on my rotation cool that its across from a highline entrance .
ive been to this place before but the last time was a real disappoint the roti canai was soggy and the satay beef was tough and cold the main courses were mediocre the cook may have had an off night .
food is consistently great but the real treasure is kevin the sommelier who is amazing at helping pick the perfect wine .
the new nyonya sold out portions are tiny and have more garnish than actual food they attempt to make the decor new and modern which takes away authenticity of the old place the old nyonya will be missed .
food was good but great environment and food presentation polite staff and never felt rushed in my consumption perfect spot for a good brunch or lunch amongst friends .
call me crazy but i liked the old nyonya better id agree with rebecca a after this place upgraded the food significantly downgraded ive had better roti canais and mee gorengs dont get me started about the service meh .
cookies for dessert homemade warm delicious you get six cookies of different types highly recommended way to top off the meal the veal meatballs and gnocchi special was very good also .
its okay typical malaysian food hard to go wrong with indian bread and chicken on rice ive had better .
great food great place details see all other five star reviews .
sure aint what it used to be when chef maura left so did the quality and creativity of the meals plus the neighborhood anymore marone .
yummy this place never disappoints its great for lunch brunch and dinner my favorite dish is their veggie lasagna ive never had anything like it hope it stays on the menu for a long time .
stopped in to grab a slice for lunch the only available slices were plain which was nothing special grabbed a soda from the cooler got home and found it was three months expired will not go back .
hands down best breakfastbrunch ive ever had with bloody marys thatll cure that nyc hangover in a jiffy .
this place is just another pizza place except that it does not pay its workers i refuse to support a business with unethical management i know plenty of mom and pop pizza shops that serve good pizza and also treat workers fairly .
great food long wait .
gross dirty rude food is not impressive by any means the flavors are not well balanced they never get the heat right .
had dinner at cookshop last week what a treat great environment excellent service food is all organic sustainable and positively delicious the braised beef was divine .
the food is so salty its almost inedible been here twice now and also two other friends said the same its ok i would give it a 3 but i dont understand how it got so many good reviews .
pricey but really good salad with almonds green olives and yellow raisins was perfectly balanced one of those simple but brilliant things .
this place is pretty inconsistent sometimes its pretty good and sometimes its not also i cant decide what offends me more the fact that they charge 2 25 for a can of soda or that they deliver said soda warm .
great burger atmosphere is busy but nice long lineups on the weekend but a great standard .
really love the food here service is okay servers always pretty nice but not that attentive this place has become more trendy less about good food also waitress complained to her friend about people not tipping her much which turned me off from wanting to come back .
reliable and tasty you can usually get away with ordering the smaller plates as the portions are large .
the food is ok at best the plus side are their breakfast food items the pancakes are the bomb but everything else is a pass food is super salty and bland the decor is dark and woody .
went for sunday brunch and had a great experience the service was excellent we ordered some of the servers suggestions and really enjoyed all of the food definitely recommended .
they deliver but food isnt that great .
love this spot terrific menu reasonable prices for such high quality and goodsized portions you will not leave still hungry cool atmosphere very attentive service brunch is always packed but worth the wait and the crowd make reservations .
they use poor quality meat subway is much better .
first everything that we ordered was excellent second presentation was outstanding third service was attentive fourth the desserts were absolutely outstanding fifth great casual atmosphere all in all a most wonderful dining experience .
the paneer makhani was abysmal the gravy was poorly done and tasted like canned tomato puree the paneer was like rubber very disappointing .
sweet sigh of a happy belly the rabbit with gnocchi and roasted carrots heavenly .
i have been to this place before but this review is based on my last visit alone all the dishes that we ordered were not fresh and seemed as if they were frozen the quality of food has been going down since my past visits .
very very good the best bloody mary ive had yet in nyc .
pros they deliver to my work cons super oily paneer bhurjee minced cottage cheese with peppers a true indian classic bland yellow dal .
the dishes are overwhelmingly meaty but if that doesnt define comfort food i dont know what does i would have felt more comfortable if i had remembered to wear socks that evening and the sausage skin dont get me started .
vegetarian food is just so blend some of the non veg dish like goan fish was slightly sweet paneer tikka was not at all good it was as if paneer was dipped in butter and then cooked on a pan no good .
everything was great service atmosphere and food we sat at the bar and ate deviled eggs and a steak good times .
food was tasty service was abysmal dishes arrived cold and not everything came out at the same time pity the place has nice ambiance but cant seem to get it together .
total fan wonderful specialty cocktails and a rotating menu brava .
poor food .
great brunch duck confit rabbit sausage oysters .
insanely priced 4 25 for two mediocre pancakes that dont even come with enough syrup cmon bagel was good but what bagel isnt nice can of 7up tho .
great brunch one of the best ive had in fact loses points for keeping my group waiting 20 minutes even though we had a reservation looking forward to trying other meals here hopefully on less busy days .
ordered a take out burger they said it would take 10 minutes it ended up taking 45 minutes the burger was over done and there were literally 5 fries there was no apology or effort to make up for there shit service never going back .
cannot be any better every single time ive been there never been disappointed the food is so perfect love it so get my 5 stars .
not impressed with taste of food or atmosphere or service by host only the cheff serving rodizio was favorable only decoration is inviting location on merchant st much better boi na brasa bar grill .
cookshop is still going strong in my book its not the type of place where you pop in unannounced if you do expect a wait if you have enough foresight be sure to book your table in advance on opentable .
totally overrated the service is terrible food is good but not great and its pricy .
brunch is my favorite meal especially if it has froyo of course went for the parafait homemade frozen yogurt granola and fruit i need to update later on after ive tried more and to go for dinner .
careful if you go with a group and sit at the bar to eat andor drink more than once they tried to bill me for stuff i did not order prices are higher than their competitors in the same neighborhood .
yummy breakfast good coffee id recommend for a business breakfast .
this restaurant went out of business in 2014 .
you cant go wrong with cookshop been many times and solidly a 4 star restaurant the scallops last night were awesome brunch there is crazy busy but worth it make a brunch reservation and prepare to wait awhile for the table worth it .
terrible service called for take out they transfered me to another number that number asked what restaurant i wanna order from confusing then i tell him i want a combination platter and he says they dont have them when clearly i had the menu in front of me .
delish just had lunch there had the deviled eggs with lots of paprika we also had the hamburger delicious burger but i have to confess the bun is a little greasy service sublime the mussels may have been the best ive ever had spiced with bacon .
theyre closed .
great simple meals try the oatmeal cookies for dessert this is one of the better places to eat in chelsea .
ive been there 3 times the first 2 times they gave me the wrong order and the last time they finally got it right but when i took the first bite half the ingredients were missing they definitely do not pay attention to the orders .
get the heuvos rancheros you wont be disappointed i cant wait to return to this place .
food is ok but nothing remarkble in an area where you can expect pretty high standards for indian .
breakfast is the most important meal of the day has to be one of cookshops mantras because they do it right the fare is warm and reminds me of what meals are all about damn good food .
nice looking place i ordered the chicken strips and they were good not great my waitress vivien v was very cold overall not a friendly barrestaurant .
just went here for lunch the staff was very attentive it was a bit cold where we were sitting by the door i had the scallop tacos with pineapple salsa it was amazing everyone was happy with their meals .
this place wasnt so bad however the buffet food tasted old and dried out if it wasnt for that one fact which most buffet food tends to taste like the prices and special werent that bad but there is better places to get your chinese food from .
sunday brunch was great the pancakes were amazing and the bloody marys were fantastic not too spicy just perfect .
meatiocre the steak is cooked to death no amount of lime can bring it back .
great food great service all around host bartender waiter the special pork chop had sold out just before we ordered so i will not be reviewing the special pork chop arrrrrgh sidecar very good oysters very good scallops very good nuff said enjoy .
pizza was ok big let down was seeing a cook come out of the rest room wearing his apron when i mentioned it to the lady taking our order she did not think it was a big issue i wont go back .
brunch was a tad disappointing but i would live here for the bananananana bread alone and then id get fat .
very pedestrian food veal was tough pasta over cooked and pizza uninspiring oh and the rolls were stale maybe an off night the server was extremely pleasant and efficient .
read my full review at newyorkeater com newyorkeater comeats20… .
worst service ever we were ignored for an hour asked a busboy for a waiter none came when we walked out no one noticed .
ive been here many times the food and service are fantastic .
food was good service was ok left a tip next day checked my bank account and 10 was added to the tip never eating there again rather go to ginza in wethersfield .
blown away the lamb ribs were to die for it literally fell of the bones and so clever of the chef to incorporate dehydrated raspberries and crispy ginger ive been here multiple times and i am never disappointed in fact i fall deeper in love with the food .
not friendly almost rude rush you out would not allow points on the ginza vip card .
epic next level flavors creativity service the food is so good each dish with the first bite i was so proud to have ordered it for my lady date and oh how id missed that broccoli and marrow .
this place is a rip off its not good its expensive they dont have good fish they try to be upscale but they are not .
great flavors and eclectic spins on traditional dishes dessert was not my favorite but interesting enough .
service was ok food was poor 22 for a sushi roll this is rice folks will never return .
went to the gorbals in brooklyn and the food was excellent the roof top bar has amazing views of manhattan and can be a very romantic place looking forward to going back again soon .
extremely slow service the restaurant appeared understaffed and our server ignored us and other customers we had to go to the wait stand to get his attention so we could payer our bill the food was excellent however so may be we were there on a bad night .
amazing rooftop cheap strong drinks haven tried the food yet really cool atmosphere .
in my opinion this place caters to rich snobs the prices are very high portions are small the special rolls are at best mediocre of course service is attentive and it is very beautifully decorated .
the restaurant has a very italian feel to it and their chef likes to walk out and greet his patrons what more can u ask for from a restaurant the food is delicious and the lasagna is to die for their desserts dont get enough credit too .
go here if you want overpriced mediocre japanese food .
always great byob next to bike store had papadelle pasta delicious but try something else next tome .
average not authentic cuban food it could be better the cuban sandwich is good .
this is a very nice little italian restaurant this place gets full by 630 pm on saturday evenings so make a reservation i had the chicken mascotta which was tender flavorful and not too salty or oily the services was efficient .
the service here is sub par and pushy this is more of a fast food place but recently during the afternoon shift ive had some encounters with rude employees i would say at night it looks different the food is mediocre more of a tapas style .
definitely a cut above many of the other local italian eateries .
theyve raised the prices and dropped the quality it was bound to happen 100 montaditos in manhattan with 1 jamón montaditos was too good to last the jamón is now of worse quality and too salty what a pity .
the best highend italian restaurant in caldwell the flourless chocolate cake is to die for omg .
not worth the hype came here for their wednesday promotion where all the items on the menu are 1 sangria 2 beers 3 nothing was good mostly just bread with tiny portions of either shrimpmeatballspulled porkchickenwhichever other filling save your money and go somewhere else for happy hour .
excellent menu well prepared weve eaten there several times and especially enjoyed the fried zucchini cut like straws service also excellent you can tell it is good because so many guests are obviously long time customers .
this place look dirty to me the food are so bad and on top the owner i believe the sister give me a attitude will never ever go back there they do not know what they do anyway starbucks is coming soon .
the place is great we waited a while to try it but after hearing it was so good from everyone we gave it a try and have been going back every week since .
very disappointed in quality of baked goodsno way they are baked from scratch as advertised my guess is they buy premixed stuff and bake them on the premisesbut no way are these from scratch cookies and brownies .
best italian restaurant in the area i give it 5 stars for food and 4 star overall the place get a little crowded on the weekend and the place is small dont miss this little gam of a restaurant .
terrible service average food waited an hour and fifteen minutes for food while listening to laughter and a party atmosphere from the kitchen manager did not consider comping anything nor did i ask as money was not the issue wont be back .
consistently excellent a true standout in a town full of great italian restaurants ive dined here on several occasions over the years and have never left disappointed .
you want mediocre food great eat here you want mediocre drinks too this is your place its loud semidirty and pretty much an average bar blah and if you park on clark or pearl youll get a ticket yay .
terrific lunch at very reasonable prices good food served attentively in a lovely garden setting at prices more suited to a sandwich shop great value .
came here for brunch but it was on mothers day so they charged 18 for a subpar buffet the brunch was ok not many options there but the food we had was fine although the spread was bare .
they have indoor seating and outdoor seating in the back garden service is great and so friendly falafel is fantastic babaganoush is delicious its also byob which is another yay .
i wanted something quick and inexpensive i figured how bad could it really be well i definitely found out i ordered the chicken cheesesteak came with fries it was so dry and bland not too happy that i wasted 4 but i know better for next time .
great service and excellent food we started with a chopped salad and veal liver then shared the lamb and chicken kebabs for our entrees delicious coming back for more .
it was just ok the empanadas were undercooked and the steak was something i could cook at home it is a lovely restaurant and the owner was very pleasant but i will probably not return there are better argentine restaurant in the city .
pros friendly and knowledgeable staff helped carry a large to go order out to my car seasonal outdoor seating healthy cons can get a little too loud favorites spicy mashed vegetables stuffed cabbage with chicken chicken kebob with yogurt ayran yogurt shake .
liked the atmosphere the food not so much tried out some apps with the tuna tartar being my favorite and the blood sausage over polenta the least overall food was a little too bland .
they have excellent lunch specials the staff is very warm and accommodating this is a new go to spot for me for lunch also they have a really nice patio out back makes for an awesome date spot in the warmer months without getting your wallet crushed .
extra 3 per card if u pay with chinese credit card ridiculous no reminds before no signs out the restaurant .
for 9 95 the lunch special was beyond great healthy and tasty full size dinner portion 2 kinds of rice hummus appetizer soup small salad and bread i am officially stuffed and i normally need 2 sandwiches from the sandwich theory right next door for lunch .
nice people but thats about it this is a chinese restaurant with a few thai dishes that are no where near authentic thai food waste of time and money hate to say that because staff was friendly but i went there to eat thai food hello .
excellent lunch spot perfectly cooked and marinated just great lost one star because after all its a kebab hut not the rainbow roo m .
cramped seating not as much variety as other thai places brusque service bland food small portions good effort though i can imagine that only those who find black pepper to be spicy and zippy will tolerate the blandness of this food .
i have only been here for lunch they offer a price fixed menu with many options food is consistent and tasty great coffee too .
pad thai not at all as good as the ones in tara thai or other joints spring roll not so good hot and sour soup was ok service was fast not many people in the joint .
great food great lunch menu prices and portions will definitely be back to try all the other things i wanted but couldnt eat all at once .
rude service forgettable food only redeeming quality is that its byob which is actually unfortunate because it means i actually have to go there when boozeloving friends pick it for parties and dinners out .
excellent this is my new lunch spot cheap good quality food good music squeaky clean family friendly good service sht this might be the best all around restaurant ive ever been too .
salty watery plain really bad thai food also more than once gotten dirty glass sand silverware not clean dont go .
our coworking space had a community breakfast this morning with a spread from scratch bread it was delicious i had the softboiled eggs with grits with some bbq sauce amazing .
i used to live a block from this place and i still only went twice terrible quality thai if you want reasonable quality thai and you live in princeton youre going to have to go to plainsboro or penang lawrence hope you have a car .
still killin it like damn good bread good food good peeps they even got an inside now .
they need to work on the sanitation seriously 80 of the times i find hair in the dishes one time my stomach got sick after the meal .
first time ive ever eating such an amazing meal out side at 8am try it all the staff is so amazing and their suggestions are spot on .
its not the best thai food in the world but it doesnt have competition and the red currys pretty good .
delicious but ridiculously overpriced breakfast for 1 was almost 30 dollars of all the restaurants in my hood scratch breads the harbinger for the coming wave of gentrification still their food and coffee are absolutely delicious .
the food is not very good its very greasy and not that flavorful it is byob which is a plus and probably its only plus .
all da shit is good if youre a foodie your brain will explode wanting to try everything .
i dont like thai food and this is worse than that .
literally a hole in the wall restaurant really fresh bread the smoothness of the bread really stood out to me whatever roll i ordered was no bigger than my fist but it stuffed me thats hard to do too gotta remember to go back here .
oh my lord the marker of a good thai restaurant starts with whether they have good pad thai or not at least outside of thailand that is the marker and oh my word their pad thai is horrible lets not waste time or money there service was okay .
best hole in the wall place ive found in a long time love the stumptown roasters coffee build your own grits are yum my fave grits soft egg mushrooms and the chili sauce .
yuck bad food just like the service .
great great brunch order and bring it home or to a friends house youll be king food is always fresh and worth the wait its a sidewalk window cool concept they save so we save and get yummy food .
i got take out there the green curry was slightly questionable the pad thai was good but they only gave us perhaps 3 pieces of shrimp .
holy heart attack i love this place get anything here any item on the menu this is a togo kind of place but you can stand at the outdoor breakfast bar or sit on a nearby bench and enjoy your possibly messy item .
dont even try this place its just that bad .
this is a whole in the wall grab and go joint the breakfast menu is pretty tasty definitely try the hot chocolate very rich with a surprise burst of spiciness .
crowded as heck at lunch got a sweet n sour thai dish if you could call it thai food sucks and so does the service at least it didnt make me sick just psychologically at the calories i wasted consuming here .
omg i thought it was all hype and no substance but wow i just had maybe the best sandwich ive ever had cant wait to go again .
had an underwhelming overly sweet vegetable curry from here the other day there was a 21 tofuvegetable ratio i like tofu but come on my friend said his food was similarly oversweetened the staff was pretty nice and attentive but that alone cant overcome the mediocre food .
i go here on a weekly basis because the food and baked goods are delicious a 3 chocolate budino on the way home is too hard to resist the staff is always friendly and everythings so affordable for the quality you get this place is a gem .
i ate lunch there having the yellow curry there was way too much coconut milk in it so it was overly rich and sweet and no real curry flavor this is a sad excuse for thai food as it appears to be run by chinese service was good .
amazing bread and drip coffee good pastries but no croissant add a chocolate croissant and ill give the 5th star and will come every weekend .
hard to believe and very disappointing that there is not one vegetarian entree on the lunch menu there should be several vegetarian options and at least one vegan option why not .
soooo yummy nice to get delish comfort food w healthy alternatives .
everyone pretty much has it down atmosphere pleasant albeit loud when full menu limited uninspired and not vegetarian friendly food expensive and generally mediocre service is fine ive been for brunch lunch and dinner there are not a lot of options in hanover .
im so glad this place is here but the bread is not for everyone order carefully love the focaccia added a star for friendly service .
the ambiance hear is very sexy and intimate and amazing the food is adorable and trendy too and is pretty good the waitstaff sucks they are sooooo awkward etc .
big bomb biggity so much love for scratch .
now called king chicken the corn on the cob was pretty good if only we hadnt also had the fried chicken mashed potatoes with gravy cole slaw chocolate hockey puck and carrotish hardtack cake .
i love this place just an awesome place to grab a quick breakfast baked good of the day or other yumminess .
staff was very rude more interested in personal conversations than helping customers also they are pretty pricey for the food you get and that food is decent nothing special in anyway if you are thinking vitos think again dont believe the hype .
i enjoy the entire menu but i must say the focaccia with rosemary sea salt and chili is simply divine .
ordered the deep dish pizza when i picked it up and handed me the box i could tell it wasnt going to be very deep it was a little thicker then normal conventional pizza highly disappointed .
the food is delicious i appreciate the ownerbaker taking time to explain exactly what is in each item that is ordered she takes pride in her work and has reason to .
food is ok not my fav but the staff there is so rude apparently you order a large and get a small pizza walking in is like walking into a retirement home .
this place is amazing my favorite meal from here is grits spicy chicken meatball sicilian salsa and breadcrumbs amazingly delectable breakfast i need to try their breads asap .
vitos wethersfield is mediocre at best there are so very many better italian places to go i cant imagine actually picking this one weve been there twice and wont return .
the pecan sticky bun was not what i was expecting but it was amazing and cheap will crave it always .
their food when and if you finally are served is pretty good but that doesnt outweigh their horrid service take out is an option though .
this place is simply amazing customer service is excellent inexpensive and the food is heavenly ive gone twice this week already i recommend ordering the breakfast sandwich and the short bread to die for .
stopped by today and the place was closed it looks abandoned no signs on the door tent area looked damaged and tables are gone i havent seen anything posted anywhere about them banging up .
i have been looking for you for over 25 years great great place .
i ate here two years ago and it was amazing just went back and it sucked i had a 1 9 burgera basic burger with stringy bacon and frozen onion rings and my friend had a rib sandwich which looked like it came from burger king .
exceptional food at an unexpected corner love the taste of what i got and definitely a hidden gem good sense of humor on the menu and people working there a joyful stop highly regarded .
get ready for a 2 hours wait for alright food the order i place on amazon got here before the food came if you think the waiting is over when they seat you you are dead wrong there is a 25mins wait for when you reorder food .
this is by far the best bread i have ever had the man is brilliant with his flavors and the breakfasts are amazing he supplies bread to the best chefs in nyc and it shows that the best chefs in nyc know good taste .
its cheap for an all you can eat hotpot at 21 99 but not worth the calories imo soup base tastes bland for those who is looking for quantity over quality this place is worth it but not for me .
if you want okay bread grits salads etc go elsewhere scratchbread is truly the real deal and worth visiting .
we had a big group 17ppl apperently 6 ppl share 1 bbq is impossible the waiter was nice but he is way to busy the meat for bbq was soso .
ok someone knock me upside the head before i run back for another shrimp taco lettuce wrap thingy geez it is soooo good .
its ok nothing great other than ayce but the quality of the meat veggies and sauces is sub par your better off going to k town and getting bbq there and even thats just ok for the best in nyc you have to goto flushing plan and simple .
i just found my new favorite eatery everything i had was exceptional especially the grits with egg avocado and some hot relish .
service was horrible management needs to teach their staff manners ignoring reasonable requests for food is not right hopefully this was an isolated incident .
stuffing my face with crack bacon and pizza bread .
this place is terrible the people are courteous but the pizza is awful dull cheese bland sauce and cardboard crust i have no idea why people rave about this place to the degree that they do because the product just doesnt cut it .
no question this place is so awesome had grits with salsa verde and bacon and house cheese the people that worked there were so cool helpful try the tonic it was the best juicedrink thing ever .
mediocre pizza at best .
great staff delicious breads .
ordered a pizza and hoagie from this place quite mediocre not that new york pizza generally is anything special despite the hype and the nypd name is ridiculous though wouldnt matter if the food were good .
we just waited about 15 minutes in frigid cold for our sandwiches to be made and it was worth the wait not your average sandwich place delicious in every way i will be back .
looked promising but was just okay the roschetto sp wasnt bad but the chicken ranchero was just awful .
the sidewalk pizza was truly something special cant believe it took me so long to try this place the coffee is also nice and strong .
awful pizza is rubbery staff is rude and the hours are bizarre they close whenever they want to .
i wont make my bread pudding with anything other than their butter rolls ridiculous how tasty and imaginative their products are .
ehhhhh id rather pay the money and take a plane train or automobile to ny for a slice like vip pizza in bayside .
how can focaccia be so good .
coulda been better coulda been worse the wings were soggy and the spinach ricotta white pizza was way too rich i sincerely hope this isnt the best philadelphia pizza has to offer .
love it delicious interesting bread straight from the oven its a neighbourhood staple .
visited philly for work and dropped by nypd based on yelp reviews had a slice of the bbq chicken and thought it was pretty bad dry and tasteless definitely had been sitting around awhile cpk puts out a better pizza than this sorry not my kind of pie .
i walk down to scratch a few times a week ive never been disappointed bread is outstanding and their prepared food is excellent not to mention the woman at the window is a complete sweet heart .
just purchased a large pie from there how do you say horrible thank god it was like only 6 it felt like cardboard was paper thin looked as if it had been sitting i will never purchase another pizza from here again .
picked up some focaccia yesterday 6 and it was amazing dipped it in a little bit of frankies evoo just put it over the top ice coffee is stumptown but at 3 for a small cup of it kind of pricey .
keep in mind you get what you pay for stopped by there to pick up some slices between meetings asked for black pepper was told that we dont have any condiments what kind of place doesnt keep any pepper .
dear scratch bread you know bostons a pretty great city maybe you should think about coming to visit us up here and maybe bring some of that tomato jam with you and the bread and the iced coffee dont forget the grits xoxo michelle .
just ridiculously bad service waited 30 minutes for a table when there are three empty tables then wait 45 minutes for food need to significantly upgrade the staff before i would ever consider coming here again .
i fucking love your bread .
food is good service sucks and the wait for foodcheck is extremely too long .
delicious baked goods the pizza bread is a destination food meaning that item alone is worth the trip .
ill give this place 2 stars the waffle tasted god but it was very soggy .
for the love of god you need to eat the stuffed sour cheese curds pickles pesto in a toasted sourdough pocket dont question the ingredients it just works .
decent food decent prices slllloooooowwwwww service bring a book and be prepared to wait you will also have to get up and find the servers if you want your drink refilled .
a walk through window for a bakery is intriguing great breads i need to try more .
the stars are for the lovely space drinks and music food needs to be improved if they expect return dining customers in our foodie neighborhood seafood seems to be an especially weak point for them .
rosemary focaccia is the best a work of art matthew tilden owner is awesome you must go for brunch try soup too made with love you can taste the passion check out this link vimeo com7163527 .
who is cooking today wings are overdone and dried out they forgot key ingredients on my husbands sandwich and the chicken was dry i dont know why we order from them .
the parma the bourbon wheat the shortbread focaccia and the mole banana cake and props to the friendly staff im buying loaves and bringing them to suburban dinner parties try the parma with avocado or the focaccia with goat cheese .
just ok but then again everything in jersey is crap or just ok at best i live in chicago and really question why people still live here .
really unique and tasty baked goodies and bread i moved here from northern california 10 years ago and honestly havent found decent baked bread until i discovered scratchbread this past year the focaccia scones and the vbar are all exceptional .
10 for a tasteless salmon salad sandwich with terrible slicer tomatoes when were in the middle of tomato season accompanied by a pitiful little side salad this place sucks .
bacon egg and hot sauce muffin oh my 2 and darkly baked and bleeping amazin now sold at the brooklyn flea right up front near the door rustic gorgeous and creative loaves rolls muffins and cheaply priced for the bleepin great quality .
this seems to be the place where the politically correct set gather for lunch ive been a few times and can say the food is very good but as expected very pricey and very small portions id much rather get a bomber sandwich at city market quite frankly .
we were fortunate enough to have the scratchbread stuffing made from their own mix at our thanksgiving apparently their scones are fantastic too but i havent yet tried them highly recommended .
got the shrimp po boy all breading and no shrimp wack very disappointing considering what brought me here was the yelp reviews .
great atmosphere and really well done brick over pizza the dough was perfect and the toppings were delicious i also tried the beef tar tar it was very tasty and high quality i wish they had more specials for drinks though will return .
they put ketchup on their poboys be warned bread is flown up from nola though .
service parking and location was great pizza and salad had great taste it came out quick and was timed perfectly as we had to get on the road dough was okay hard to eat with toppings falling off pizza .
seating on bar against the wall with not a bench but 13 of a bench chicken biscuit small unsatisfying over salted good purple cabbage shrimp po boy the roll could have been much better but the shrimp were good had higher hopes for this place .
ordered kale salad gnocchi scallops and meatballs all wonderful flavors all delicious smaller portions with a price but totally worth it and great to share and try different things everything on the menu looks great and will be back to try more .
2 donuts small and a large coffee for 9 beilers donuts at reading terminal market have better and cheaper donuts .
the potatoes were so good that i abstained from throwing my girlfriend on a table and having sex with her in the middle of the restaurant for fear of being asked never to return .
way overpriced for a tiny sliver of grilled chicken and barely any fresh mozzarella which btw they charge extra for first and last time i go there .
great service happy hour is the best 12 price drinks plenty of parking not a huge selection of food but the pizzas are great .
very poor management very rude staff sorry did not get chance to judge the food coz the staff was not ready to cooperate think twice before going with a large group very rigid staff .
thin crispy crust pizza from their wood oven had great toppings bartender had some refreshing mixes .
oily food ambience and service are great though .
i love love love this place half off pizza tuesdays and half off bottle of wines wednesday .
went here a couple months ago with visiting friends it was awful most trays were empty leading to a slim selection what was available was warm to cold it was so bad that one of our friends vomited in the lobby area then again in the parking lot .
delicious food and pizza nice ambience as well would recommend getting an outside spot during the summer months you have a great view .
food was not fresh never again .
just moved here from california been here twice and everything is amazing the pepperoni pizza is possibly the best i have ever had and the whipped ricotta is a must have service and environment was excellent both times will definately be coming back .
abysmal i hope i dont get sick .
been here about 10 times since it became in riva and have yet to have a bad experience awesome pizzas and decent wine selection .
it is typical cheap chinese buffet not too shabby the management seems to coming around to check if things are going well the 6 999 99 lunchdinner is only weekdays on weekends and holidays it was 11 99 .
great pizza good beer fantastic outdoor deck lovely staff dog dining area cant fault this place im now a regular .
just passing food no real reason to come here unless you are traveling and there are no other choices mate .
one of the best hiddensecret pizza spots around if you can make the trek to east falls you wont be let down really cool outdoor dining spot too get the truffle pizza they also have amazing bruschettas dont skip this place .
completely contrived decorlooks like a cool nyc bar from a bad action movie makes houston street even more disgusting than it has already become .
awesome food my advice get a chefs tasting and enjoy it seems expensive 30 something but you get so much amazing food for the price youll need to be rolled out throw in some sangria and a seat outside and youve got a perfect meal .
horrible the food is poorly made and old see the pic of the edamame they sent me gross do yourself a favor and just save your money .
great pizza with several different options and a great location next to the river the only negative is that they love charring the crust a bit too much .
everything on the menu sounds delicious and maybe i had high expectations due to the reviews that i received but i was very disappointed .
i love their pizza everything we have tried there is really good their food is so good that inriva hosted my baby shower last year and they were great i did not quite get their menu at first but after visiting several times i love it must try .
ive had several lunches here but today was the worse i ordered the sweet rosie the prosciutto was thick tough and salty it could have been wonderful if they had used parma prosciutto cut thinly with the fresh mozzarella and pesto .
this place is excellent my cousin brought us here while we were visiting from miami omg great food we got a bunch of items and shared everything .
just wanted to mention that i have recently noticed that their horrible french fries received a makeover theyre now actually pretty decent with a good dipping sauce prices however still remain out of control .
great beer selection and great food awesome atmosphere .
go here if you want a good selection of beer skip it if you want good customer service or nonoverpriced food .
any place with a huge bikes and beer sign is a win inriva is a pleasant surprise right off the bike path in east falls i love the outdoor seating and ambiance service is fast and friendly i went there for brunch and it was awesome great spot .
ive never experienced such rude and insensitive customer service my group of 12 walked out with out eating due to the owners complete lack of professionalism no second chances can be granted when such obvious distain for cultivating pleasant customer relations is displayed .
superb pasta dishes and a solid craft beer list the portion sizes are exactly what you would anticipate for a restaurant of this quality although if you are extremely hungry i recommend ordering an appetizer as well .
saw a worker entering prices into the database hitachino nest beers for 7 65 a piece that is more than it costs at bars place is a total rip off stay away .
awesome burrata kale salad amazing pizza was great service was excellent we went late evening for dinner outside seating was really pleasant people were sitting inside at the bar too id go back and do that highly recommended .
horrible sushi and rude service would not go back .
happy hour until 7 is the big headline here the pizza is delicious fresh and fast had some potatoes in a bacon jam also delicious but a little on the light side the atmosphere is nice everybody is very friendly they will certainly have my business again .
shit place shit service good pizzas you should be ready to be humiliated by the staff before going .
not a bad thing to say about this place good beer better food and awesome decor will be back over and over again .
came here and ordered breakfast will not do that again this diner is expensive for no reason over priced breakfast made with egg substitute grossed me out .
while others love the pizza i wasnt that impressed what i thought was brilliant was the ricotta topped with fig and fried onions this is a religious experience also the home made pasta is incredible its a great place for brunch that will be a crowd pleaser .
theyre open nice at late at least .
great wood fire pizza we tried a bunch but my favorite was the mushroom really good with a variety of mushrooms on it also love the fried chickpeas they put out in the table for you to munch on so addicting .
not fresh avoid at all costs salad leaves were spoiled cilantro topping was yellow .
wonderful fresh food for lunch we shared the tartare veneziana so good i could have licked the little jar it came in and the mushroom pizza was so perfectly seasoned on a chewy thin crust couldnt be better well go back again for sure and recommend to others .
interesting concept and cute storedecor but when it comes down to it the pizza isnt exactly that good and it is quite expensive also i dont feel like its any healthier than normal pizza even though its made with good ingredients .
great place great atmosphere i had the margarita pizza and a few cocktails love the puppies and pizza outside area .
i really would not go back until the product get better decent concept terrible execution .
really great pizza and other italian options get the whipped ricotta and caprese salad to start the atmosphere is hipster and very fun .
pizza was burned and dry out first and last time it was one of the worst pizzas ive had in a while and the place looks like a hole in the wall something out of the 60s .
very good the great place to get some bottled talian beers you havent seen before the pizza was awesome as well and dawn the bartender really knew her stuff and very friendly as well .
food is excellent but the service was bad waited 20 minutes for waiter to show up then waited 90 minutes for the food to come and it was cold waiter could careless lobby is way too small .
love coming here always a great experience .
this place sucks the staff forced me andy wife out due to a game they rushed everything our entree came about 5 minutes after we got our appetizers the team they were cheering lost lol i will never go back thanks scannichio for ruining our dinner .
the pizza was pretty good had a salad as well cant remember the name it had white beets in it a little weird but tastes pretty good half off bottles of wines .
def not a place i got for italian food ever again good place for italian food spasso front and market and pesto broad and passyunk def not on my list .
amazing pizza also love ceci bean dip great outdoor patio recommend going on tuesdays for half off select pizzas .
stick with el matador for authentic mexican .
i went back to in riva and enjoyed the spicy ham pizza the garlic crema is fantastic service was good even with reservations they didnt have a nice table for us so we sat at the community table not a very romantic atmosphere but the pizza was good .
just too expensive spent 37 for one and its byo guacamole is the best thing on the menu and ive been here 3 times i really really want to love this place .
great food great view great people .
five star service but one star food the tortilla chips were thick and flavorless my salad contained a hair which did not belong to me the server assured me the kitchen staff wore hairnets but i had lost my appetite at that point .
seriously yummy pizza had the pancetta and pineapple and feel like that will be a staple for me mouth is watering thinking about it love the outdoor deck great little pizza place in walking distance from my house .
food was ok nothing that was related to any of these reviews reason for 2 stars very small portions on take out when ordered the boiled yucca it was 3 look alike french fries .
loved the berrata the cippolina was very tasty but rich split that one service people are great .
not worth it hipster chinese food spicy cucumbers are great and the lo mein was good the rest was just so so .
great place to spot after a workout in kelly drive you can park your bike and enjoy a nice meal .
so slow wait for the cuisine for looooooong time oh my god and waiter is indifferent and cold .
excellent service rare and delicious italian dishes in a great spot tomato conserva is a must try appetizer .
everything seems to be cooked in the same sauce good but boring after a couple dishes .
probably the most unlikely of places to expect amazing buffalo wings awesome pepperoni pizza too .
wasnt impressed the dan dan noodles was just ok and the rabbit wpeanuts in chilli sauce consisted mostly of peanuts chopped scallions rabbit bones and three small pieces of rabbit meat .
interesting cocktails but wish they put more selections on the menu i really like the pizza sauce i wish they lowered the prices a bit and that their appetizers werent so tiny must haves the pizzas special cocktails artichoke appetizers and the seafood appetizers .
food is great but the delivery service dashed delivery is awful the order is always screwed up and takes an hour or more dash blames the restaurant no more delivery eat in only .
food is really smashing the best pizza i have ever had on this side of the pond casual and a lot of fun .
server spent too much time explaining the menu to one table who came after us especially when we made reservation look up the menu online please before going to this kinda place food i have no complain yet .
amazing the pizza tastes exactly the same in italy highly recommended .
too rushed give us a chance to enjoy the appetizers before tossing every entree onto the table also dishes seem to have lost some heat and thats why we come .
great location as it overlooks the river had the mushroomtruffle pizza beet salad and spareribs all of which were above average it is a great place to unwindhave a drink on a lazy sunday afternoon .
dumpling dough to pork stuffing ratio in the appetizer tilted heavily to the dough boy increasing the chili oil volume in a main dish does not necessarily complement the other fresh ingredients or make the dish more authentic .
best pizza in philly plus inventive dynamic small plates menu worth the trip this place is gonna make east falls what it should be .
service wasnt too bad forgot to bring our drinks several times gotta leave 2 stars .
4 5 stars for sure puppies and pizzas makes my week the pizza crust is remarkable .
it is no longer byob which kind of stinks .
the pizza here especially mushroom zucchini is delicious inside decor is strange and kind of dank but i love the outdoor seating on a nice night .
very loud and food made me horribly and quickly sick with the runs i will never return .
best place to go for pizza in ef hands down and they have been soooo friendly with our kids and our neighbors kids love this place .
the food was definitely innovative and delicious we got 4 appetizers from their happy hour menu however the next day my friend and i both got very upset stomachs dont think well be returning .

meal left much to be desired manager was inexplicably rude i will not be returning .
absolutely love this place the service is awesome the outdoor deck is great in nice weather and the food is fantastic and very reasonable love the veal meatballs area for dogs and bikes .
service is good food is below average prices are above average i wont be back if i dont have to too many better choices around .
very good restaurant food was well prepared and tasted well the wine was from italy and was delicious very good value although pricy for the quantity of food and drink id go again .
food like any restaurant anywhere the great atmosphere and service need to be complimented by some culinary imagination and creativity another pile of asparagus laid next to a filet really dont let my food touch heaven forbid .
my husband and i stopped here durinh happy hour last friday and tried the chefs special entree our cchef was brian and omg the food was greeeeeeeaaaat we ate til we couldnt eat anymore we will def be coming back wow .
its a bar and grill so why was i hoping for flavor oh well this place will please those looking for slightly upscale bar fare but not anyone who likes to taste fresh food not fresh not interesting but good beer yawn .
very pleasant dining experience food was great service excellent reasonably priced except for the septa bus that parked in front of the patio for 20 minutes blowing exhaust all over the patrons typical easy parking and dont forget the desserts definitely returning .
bad the thirtyfive dollar steak was tasteless the wine our server recommended was mediocre as was the osso bucco he said would be fantastic brussel sprouts were raw i will never return .
great food outstanding service and nice location .
as always in princeton the food is expensive but bland and okay expensive overrated nothing great without the rich demographic in the princeton area restaurants like witherspoon girl would never thrive .
have been a few times for half price tuesday pizza night very good pizza im not sure id pay the full price for it but it is good and the appetizers are goodinteresting as well .
the food is good but its overpriced for what you get i can get much better steak at better prices at kc prime and i can get better seafood at blue point grill i do like their thirty wines under 30 list though .
good pizzas with yummy appetizers would come here over and over again to eat their ribs nice outdoor seating great for the springsummer .
very expensive great location but rather crowded and the food is soso they also have the annoying habit of charging extra for everything the side dishes the extra bread and so on .
fantastic food great pizza great appetizers great service and great ambiance i make it a point to eat here each time i come up to visit philly .
the hostess and sever was so rude to our party the food is great dec 12 2014 terrible service .
very good napolistyle pizza its between this and nomad pizza on south for best italianstyle pizza in philly .
the only thing worse than the 80s tattoos are the stale coffee beans and lousy espresso drinks no maybe the attitude is worse .
liked the food service and atmosphere were friendly .
wont go there again nice crowd that likes to show off trendy place but the food is not good you are paying for the scene but if you like good food dont go there .
pizza and meatballs were very good artichokes were too deeply fried grilled calamari was good but a ridiculously small portion even for tapas cocktails were expensive fun casual place to hang out if in the area great view with outdoor seating .
im disappointed every time i come here great atmosphere and location but the food is just so so caveat have not tried brunch in sum meh .
love love love the pizza salad is awesome as well as the octopus hip atmosphere great for out of town guests .
the food is delicious but my low star rating has to do with the very unwelcoming and down right rude service on top of that the server we got didnt even know the menu very well and then got defensive when i asked about a particular plate .
i love this place the cippolini pizza is amazing the staff was extra friendly and the location is just perfect for bikers runners etc on kelly drive if the weather is nice make sure you get a seat outside to enjoy the sun and view of the river .
meh not a huge fan took forever for our food to arrive and when it did it was kinda cold the big breakfast doesnt compare at all to an english big breakfast .
what wasnt great about this place the service is phenomenal the food impeccable and the ambiance fantastic hats off to arthur for creating an amazing and unique dining experience brava all .
didnt get a chance to try the food here because we never got waited on eventually we just gave up and left after being ignored and the staff didnt even notice maybe well try again sometime .
what a fun place and good food we cant wait for the deck to open i agree its about time east falls has a really fun place and good food i hope it makes it we cant wait to return .
overpriced oversalted and just plain old disappointing hipster hangout save yourself the wait and just go up the street to brooklyn label for a much more enjoyable experience .
i love the french fry pizza yes french fry pizza its probably really bad for my body but it is just too good to resist i never tried any entrees from here but the pizza is always great .
this place blows stay away at all costs dont believe the hype the quality that presided here has moved on to greener pastures .
great place to take the kids they really enjoy the ice cream and the shark in the water drink .
mediocre brooklyn fare but my real issue is with the waitstaff they stole my eyeglasses i left my brown la font eye glasses at brunch and they couldnt find them wink so go ahead and eat their mediocre crap but dont leave anything behind .
appetizers and melt sandwiches are good and you cant go wrong with the ice cream .
i just wish that had even one vegan option on the menu sure its my choice to be vegan and i dont have to go to this restaurant but itd be nice its not that hard .
service was great the pale was clean and well organized the food was very good my eggs came out exactly as i wanted over hard and for some reason a lot of restaurants have a hard time delivering that the pancakes were perfect .
not sure what is the food source spanish middle east local american anyway its mediocre the place is beautiful but noisy as hell will not go back .
good reliable sandwich place in a great location not crazy about the lack of silverware and real plates when you dinein take out is fine fast and polite service note please use mustard on your cuban sandwich russian dressing .
great drinks amazing atmosphere our bartender vanessa was rude she didnt even attempt to crack a simple and we were here for two hours ordering drinks hire friendlier staff .
i really love this shop the staff are generally friendly and the food is consistently good my only gripe is that the owner has been saying for years that theyre going to be open on sundays but so far no such luck .
extremely poor portions snooty staff and very unwelcoming am i doing you a favor i dont think so better step up your game or cease to exist i eat meat but nothin worthwhile for my vegetarian date .
i order from this place every friday i love it it has yet to let me down the whole office orders and they dont give me any attitude when i have 3 credit cards and a cash order lol love it the prices are great for fresh food .
i ate there on april 4 and they did not inform any of their customers about the hepititus a situation they had a packed house and were offering desserts i will never eat there again .
great food and great staff always happy here .
no credit cards except american express and so we have to go out in the cold to find an atm lame .
this place was great i cant wait to go back for more im going to try their wraps next last time i had the roast beef brie and honey mustard on a baguette so good and filling i cant wait to try more soon .
the quality of the food and service significantly went down over the years ordered about 10 plates and i was impressed by none also too loud and too crowded normally 3 stars but their inattentive and unfriendly service loses them a star .
good sandwiches i had the reuben which was delicious it was crowded as it was a saturday afternoon i got the last seat i will return .
the food was okay nothing super amazing the space is fantastic .
stopped in today for the first time and asked the girl what she recommended she suggested the avocado dream pressed sandwich ohhh lawd it was so good i will be back .
overrated sangria isnt good the food was mediocre had the bacon wrapped dates and olives sea urchin risotto squid ink paella skirt steak and i think something else but i cant remember i would go back to get the whole shebang though .
i love to go here with my coworkers during lunchtime the sandwiches and wraps are sooo delicious and just what i need to get through the rest of my workday .
check out alta if youre looking for overpriced tiny portions brusque and unfriendly service volume that makes it impossible to hear your date .
the food and drinks are just awesome the basil fried rice pad thai was were awesome the fig based cocktail was too good .
went here on a date and was pretty underwhelmed had the bacon wrapped dates and olives decent fried goat cheese bleh didnt finish it shrimp risotto ok and the squid ink paella ok ambiance is nice but i really did not like the food much .
great prices for michelin rated food the drink specials at their midtown east location are much better than at the hells kitchen location its hard to beat 2 sapporo .
eh .
great selection of fine asian cuisine my two favorites are the spicy lemongrass kalbi short ribs and the singapore lak sa .
if what they serve are tapas they are too expensive and if they are not then the portions are ridiculous .
the michelin recommended items on the menu are incredible definitely order those they are denoted with a little footnote other than that i would also recommend the calamari which was served in a great little portioned skillet also how cute is the atmosphere very hipster asian fusion .
never go here on a friday night its kind of a meat market and you cant breathe sangria and food were ok but i think there is probably better in the city .
great food the seafood pad pen was good and spicy pad thai was good loud and upbeat calamari appetizer was different but good too good choice for hells kitchen .
i dont get the hype most of our dishes were overcooked or burnt the meatballs had whole pieces of garlic in it service inattentive the bread of my croque madame was completely black burnt and all the waitress offered was to bring more bread fail .
delicious food original recipes try not to sit upstairs as service slow there but wait staff friendly and accommodatting not too expensive .
landmarc has perfected average nothing great and nothing bad but when you are spending 100 per person you might expect a little more its very family friendly so if the thought of kids occasionally screaming isnt your thing id recommend you go elsewhere .
very nice environment the dishes were creative but delicious most important it was not expensive at all what it offered worth for the money .
bone marrow is not worth the money service is terrible does the food really matter when the service is this bad nope id say i tried it and bo ring .
great design and good food the pho is pretty good and one of the appetizer with pork rolled with honey is soooo good i forgot the name .
calamari and steak chewy overrated .
the interior is really pretty and the food was good too the price is reasonable and the waiters are really cute lol i would totally recommend this place to anyone and everyone .
seriously mediocre food but the place sure is pretty .
absolutely delicious food literally couldnt get enough and was so excited to wrap it up to take home holy basil chicken and papaya salad were my favorite .
got ribeye steak huge portion but not well seasoned or crusted french onion soup was very good for the price there are better options .
pros beef pho very delicious cant wait to go back and try some more items on the menu .
im sorry i know pizza and this is definitely not pizza crust was burnt the sauce was sweet overall i say it sucks if u like pizza this not a place to eat .
the first thing i noticed about this place is that its beautiful really nicely decorated and the food is pretty damn good too i had the clay pot catfish which was delicious .
the only thing that was tasty was my diet coke and the waffle fries from an order of 4 entrees i didnt really like the staff either so we wont be coming back .
the food here is much better than other thai places but not as cheap the ambience is nicer as well the portions are generous but the servers are not too friendly .
the food is ordinary and the servers usually get your order wrong .
the best thai viet food out of asia dont ever miss it if u r a foodie like me im malaysian n been to lots of restaurants and i an say this is my top 10 best in the world .
disgusting fried fish tacos were served frozen which in itself is a problem but clearly means seafood is not fresh will not return zero stars .
i lived in bangkok and this food is incredible tofu in garlic sauce was maybe single best thai dish ive had service is great i believe waiter was yeshi and he was wonderful dont miss this place .
best pancakes 6 years in a row is overrated the german apple pancakes were mediocre at best the omelettes were over cooked and dry definitely left disappointed .
love their ambiance so cool and outstanding the food was so delicious with reasonable price and good portion as well ive been to a lot of thai restaurants and this place didnt disappoint me at all .
eh .
become one of my favorite thai places i love the tofu pad kee pao and the basil rice the ambience is also good .
food was extremely bland will not return service was not bad but we tried several dishes and all were unappealing the 4 stars reviews are a tad bit misleading .
i love this spot this is now my favorite calamari in the city the pork belly is some of the best i ever had the staff is great especially jennifer and bartender alex i strongly recommend obao .
service was slow servers were kind of rude food was nothing special we waited a while for our food portions were good though .
great food and great value everything is prepared to order and comes out fresh and hot cost of dishes are very reasonable with sizable portions service is attentive without being overbearing highly recommended for cost conscious diners that want great food at a good price .
horrible didnt speak any english got entire order wrong lied about it will never return .
this place used to be ember room and it still looks pretty i had their pad see ewe solid as well as their bun bo hue pretty good but i wish it were spicier definitely ask for some spice beforehand if you like it that way .
this place closed thankfully .
kimchee fries tasty loved them pad kraw prow was perfect it was spicy but not too spicy this place has the best thai ice tea i have ever had .
worst ahi tuna salad ive ever had .
spring rolls pho bo bun bo hue all on point pleasantly surprised with the authentic flavors service was super fast .
9 bottle of a 12oz weyerbacher ipa 7 sangria in a little wine glass filled with ice it took it 10 minutes for the server to tell us they were out of the first beer choice very disappointed cute patio though .
tasty food and good service food a better at shaigon shack though but ambience here is good .
they were really rude and disrespectful dont choose this restaurant they use to be good but now theyve changed to become a very disappointed restaurant .
my favorite thai restaurant in hells kitchen i am half thai and i only appreciate authentic thai food and restaurant reminds me of my mothers cooking they can really add spice which is what i always look for in a thai restaurant definitely recommend .
i dont know what to say other than i hope the lunch is as fabulous as they say it is dinner on the other hand was ridiculously expensive for average korean fare eundae fish entre literally had 2 pieces of monk fish costing 36 whoa .
delicious pho i personally love fish balls so im glad they have that option the interior is really nice too had the papaya salad and it was decent the ac is really cold i would definitely come back again .
was here over the weekend i ordered the skirt steak and told them medium but it came out well done i only saw my waitress once the bus boy help more than her good place for drinks and thats about it .
solid thai restaurant with a lot of space in the back room reasonably priced for the city and i they were able to accommodate me on two separate big group dinners that i had there very good pad kee mao and curry .
ate there last night homemade pasta was get but special chicken cachetora was 10 dollars more than menu average price and was not says when offered chicken was not great sauce was fine .
we went on a saturday evening 3 couples and overall had a great experience we had a few vegetarians and the restaurant was very accommodating their special drinks were great 5 out of 5 food was a solid 4 .
the food was fine but nothing special i found the portions to be rather small paid over 45 for a salad and a main course not including drinks tip tax extremely expensive service is a little slow .
pretty good .
food was unimpressive the server sniffed our wine cork .
had the catfish and it was excellent tried the khao soi was also good good flavors but the cashew chicken was terrible it had good flavor but it was overcooked and dry the thai iced tea was also too sweet but it was a good experience overall .
went to fond for dinner tonight was very rushed ordered fish and it was rawundercooked told the waiter and was offered another dish no thank you .
while the restaurant wasnt much to look at from the outside the food in here was great the dumplings were devine and the broth tasty and filling well worth a trip here .
is vinnie esposito still grabbing at the female help and cheating on his wife in between making sandwiches maybe she dumped the pig by now .
great food good service and nice atmosphere good for theatregoers though ask to get your order rushed .
change your yelp time on when you actually close and ill change my review i walk in a bit before 11 and boom the shutdown says you close much later .
some of the best pad thai ive had pho bo broth is very tasty with anise and a little jalapeño .
this is decent spot not very impressed with the decor the guacamole was disappointing not sure why would u add the indian spiced garbanzo beans it was on our list to eat but dont think would go again good cocktails .
great favors the seafood ped pad was great awesome blend of curry and spice casual atmosphere and relaxed vibe bartender was friendly and engaging bookmarked and will come back .
no way seriously another overrpriced placed w baby portions anemic service cool ambiance and eclectic menu that was different overall a miss for me .
great place the pad thai is great very attentive waiters but the host was lagging a little the fake blonde bar tender was very nice too .
pretty basic nothing stands out other than the fact its new and clean im sure that will change over time .
pork belly dishes are great .
food menu was ok but limited disappointed mainly due to expensive price service was friendly hoping for a more diversified selection of food .
this place has a great ambiance good date spot good food and even better drinks will def be back .
crap service on a notbusy saturday afternoon overpricedpoor serviceno thanks the only good thing about this joint is their french fries .
awesome place with great decor outstanding food and good service all for a great value the drinks are a bit pricey but the food is so reasonably priced i had the papaya pad thai which is so unique and delicious .
party of 7 cold food cold service had to beg for napkins brunette bartender just ignores you .
good thai food definitely try the michelin recommendations .
this place blows i took an out of town guest here after 10 minutes of no bar service we left the place was not crowded either judging by the clientele id say it gets a fairly high douche rating as well .
love the appetizer the meat rolled on a sugar cane .
still a crappy bar .
this is a must to go place the food is priced just right the specialty drinks a bit pricy but there are very taste and give good cheer i truly recommend this place .
well i just was not that impressed with the food the sandwich i got was kind of well just gross perhaps because it was almost 10pm but it is still not an excuse the service was great though .
great food good service especially recommend their pre theater menu cheap and brings a good amount will come back again .
rude service overpriced food and drinks and horrible atmosphere who wants to spend money at a place they are disrespected by the servers and bartenders there are many bars in old city no need to go here .
good food and good atmosphere .
food is terrible mussels were overcooked fishy and sandy wings were mushy it is basically a sport bar where drafts are ordinary if you are looking for better beer tons of alternatives around the corner for example national mechanics and eulogy avoid at all costs the end .
health grade grade pending i had a really quick dinner here yesterday i ordered one of their cocktails and the pho both were pretty good and it wasnt too expensive the pho also came out really quickly which was nice .
im relatively sure there is a decent bar somewhere under the thick layers of old city douchiness that cover this place but its definitely not worth digging for at midnight on a saturday .
delightful great atmosphere the lobster pad thai was awesome i am burning to go back .
friendly service but overcooked food i ate on a friday night and on a saturday morning the food isnt fresh .
the lunch menu is reasonably priced not an extensive one yet enough i had the traditional pho noddle soup as all vietnamese restaurants are judged by how tasty their noodle soup is and it was a solid 810 .
not so good overpriced an arepa is just flour and water i think the arepa truck on roosevelt ave and 78th makes it better .
went there for dinner with some friends was a cool place to hang out place food was good and reasonably priced liked the ambiance .
horrible this food impresses the average foodignorant simpleminded hipster but the leathery arepas taste like cardboard and the fillings are revolting good rum selection is not enough even if you get drunk to avoid this miserable cud .
great modern vibe and orange lanterns hanging across the ceiling which really add to the ambiance the food is simply delicious tons of flavor sadly the drinks were watered down good spot for a drink with friends or a catch up dinner .
hate this place it is hard finding a place to go when you miss home but this was just an insult the arepas were stale the cheese was too dry and the passion fruit was just water with a scent of of fruit .
loved the atmosphere especially the balloon lights and was pleased with everything we ordered the prices were a high value and the service was good overall .
i was just checking caracas in brooklyn and i noticed that the current grade is pending and it actually shows to be a little dirty i hope they can do much better very soon .
all the food was delicious and esthetically pleasing service was very good only complaint is that the decaf coffee tasted horrible .
great service but really bad food the beef was over salted the holiday special is not good at all and overpriced the plantains tasted really old first time coming in here but i wouldnt recommend it to anyone .
this place is so good i come here almost every day when im in ny best thai food and pho place around i recommend the pad ke mao clay pot fish and pho those are my favorite .
underwhelming arepas taste like cardboard and the chicken was dry and hard guac was like a green paste no taste and no avocado chunksi wonder if there was even any in there i live next door and will not be returning .
must try their clay pot shrimp and sugarcane skewers abs fav and their ambience is really nice too .
overpriced for not so good tasting food i grew up eating arepas and venezuelan cuisine and this place definitely falls short not a fan 2 stars because they have delicious cocktails and excellent service .
do not be fooled this is the best bowl of pho in nyc also the kalbi beef short ribs are amazing very good food attentive service nice decor and very reasonably priced youd need to go over 50 blocks to find anything even close for vietnamese food nonsandwich .
bleh sometimes the chicken on the bottom of their arepa de pollo is dried out and lacking flavor to that i say go to arepas cafe .
great food great service great ambience and affordable wednesday is a ladies night 5pm close 5 martini mimosa and bellini they have nice upstairs area as well make a reservation for weekend dinner .
forty five minute wait for arepas enjoy your johnny cakes hipsters .
really enjoyed it loved it as ember room but was really hard to put together a whole meal as ember room simple now worth a shot .
helping size to small and low on taste not my thing .
obao is a beautiful relaxing high end panasian experience at a reasonable price space is beautiful staff very fast and professional food was excellent i had dill fish which was fried pieces on top of vermicelli vietnamese style so good even my fish averse bf was grabbing it .
really what you just brought to the table cost how much those things that took 47 seconds to eat cost how much really you should call them arapes .
the pad thai comes with a poached egg totally made the difference yum and the pho was spot on all that and a super chill ambience .
come on really 45 minutes for a pizza to get to the table and then when it did finally get to the table it was subpar at best the sauce was pretty good but the crust totally sucked .
the food here was delicious i got the salmon noodles and loved it their drinks are also really well made and very ptetty everyone at our table was happy with their food highly recommended .
the food here in not even close to joe and pats the sauce had a sour taste the cheese was gooey and the pizza was one of the worst .
great atmosphere good food didnt have any complaints the service was slow maybe because it was very busy .
friendly nice atmophere helps compensate for soso food and the worst tiramisu i have ever had gluey needs more variety on the menu and more flavor .
obao has a beautiful atmosphere and the prices for food drinks are great the smoked dragon drink is delicious 1 star for the pho however the rare beef was more like well done .
overrated sushi served very slowly dont believe the hype .
way better than any of the three yum yums across the street classic pho bo is great pork belly salad is good too and super fresh and crunchy great for preshow nights .
mr sushi is ok for its price especially the allyoucaneat deal i must say the sushi quality is not as good or as fresh as its neighbor takei sushi the service is sometimes slow .
best pho bo in the area red curry duck was great as well .
must i even review this place the sushi was amazing and the price was great in exactly in my price range however the service was horrible the food took an hour to come out and for some reason we never could find our waitress .
very good value for the lunch special and good happy hour prices the amount of food was fine for the price flavor was good service was good and the staff was very friendly .
good deal but service is bad both in politeness and quickness and the location both this old one and the new one in wayne are ugly i wont be back .
interesting and different thai dishes good service and nice atmosphere nothing mind blowing but better than your standard run of the mill thai place very reasonable pricing as well .
i thought this restaurant was ok i thought the food was good but i felt like the place needed something an upgrade or an update the decor was so so the staff was so so .
good lunch specials very chill spot friendly staff .
for pho no way go to pho hoa the meat here was super tough .
great food fresh friendly service even good music playlist tea cups were too hit to hold .
yawn not worth remembering or yelping about to be honest just cold sandwiches oh hell just nothing write except eat downtown elsewhere then go to the show the theater itself is wonderful the cafe is a bore .
surprisingly good went in a little suspiciously since the place was almost deserted but we were both impressed with the food and will definitely come back the short ribs on sugar cane sticks were amazing by the way definitely deserves more traffic .
pricey for a diner food is not consistent portions can be generous or small food can come out hot or cold cooked or not cooked delicious or tasteless soda is sometimes flat and desserts are 9 out of 10 stale .
service is slow food took foreverrrr to come vegetable spring rolls didnt find them good or anything special they were kind of soggy refried maybe but not crispy and tasty pad thai was good 7 spices fries awesome not insanely spicy or anything but awesome love the ambiance .
food mediocre at best french toast was dried bread lightly coated in egg then fried so it had no eggy taste and the middle remained dry if not stale friend equally dissatisfied with his dish plus was attention by hostess to keep coffee cups full .
had the catch of the day with a salad and it was great really love the old photos and the view .
average at best lobster roll was served on a piece of toast wasnt great fried dough was nothing special credit card machine was broken place isnt very nice inside steer clear .
tiny little gem on market street very small space but the food is exceptional byob which made the experience even better for me since its so hard to find a good restaurant with byob now a days .
foods not bad but the people are on the unfriendly side and the prices are ridiculous .
weve been going for a few years and daltos never disappoints we refuse to get penne vodka or chicken parm at any other restaurant the owners are always very welcoming and run a great small restaurant its out go to byo close to home .
as chelsie says its basically subway except with very soggy bread from the way they heat the meat owner and staff were very friendly and place was clean but i will not return for such poor food quality .
best service best food really best food i ever had .
i only gave it 2 stars because the waitress tried so hard with our large party mediocre food incorrect orders and dirty bathrooms .
yummy i was just looking for a simple restaurant close to the movie theater down the street skip it and found this gem the food was so tasty i loved it i will be back .
food is good but received unfriendly response from the attendant may be she is not in christmas mood do not suggest for new peole .
great food small place great byob atmosphere love it .
ordered takeout the fried rice wasnt that great it was really greasy and the container was 12 full kind of overpriced at 12 there are plenty of other thai places out there if youre in the mood for fried rice dont come here .
delicious 7 and you get 2 vegetarian options 1 meat and a drink with either rice or injera the collard greens are so good as is the potatoes the woman working will normally help newbies learn how to use the injera too .
we had dinner and it wasnt all that good the thai salad was mostly iceberg lettuce and an average peanut dressing we ordered two different dishes that were painfully similar and not all that great on the positive side they were super friendly and accommodating .
i love going to the carts lalibela is great food and has many vegetarian options like most of the carts lalibela gives you way more food than i can usually eat in one sitting and there is usually enough for left overs .
food was good but overpriced 8 for 3 currypuffs at these prices i will not be back .
good cheap food i tried the spicy chicken spicy lentils and green beanscarrots i loved the bread .
pizza was bland and dough boring pulled pork sandwich also boring salad lackluster total disappointment .
for only 5 you get 3 items plus rice or injera spicy beef and spicy lentils were tasty .
place was fairly empty ordered an italian combo sandwich it was fair bread was not the freshest its ok in a pinch but there are other nearby options to choose from that may prove better .
great service .
no one in the place when we went except people at the bar the food is not so great and prices high its self serve too village pizza in newport is the bomb though go there .
charlies is great ever since finding this gem on grubhub i cant stop ordering delivery for them this is the only place i have found to have an awesome white pizza grinders are also great wish delivery was a little quicker but it is worth the wait .
yikes .
food was good service great but pricey for servings and amt of wine poured please consider senior pricing specials and coupons for those on fixed income .
bad service from the owner placed my order n didnt get everything .
first time for dinner nice to find a restaurant with healthy delicious choices only negatives were a little too noisy and the beer could be colder but will be back again .
skip the bistro glorified bar fare bland over cooked not good hopefully the drinks are strong .
creative menu and affable staff made our private party a great success the appetizers were inspired and everything else was terrific too will be back soon .
super typical chinese joint nothing really special about this place maybe more things missing than not for example the hot and sour soup wasnt hot or sour really and it was unfortunately rather lukewarm .
friendly service food is fresh and delightfully different an interesting mix of flavors .
nothing worth raving about just a glorified chinese takeout .
honestly didnt even want to write this but such a gem of new haven weekend brunch is just as good as lenas or bellas without the wait .
we are new to area were hoping this would be good find based on reviews but was not so food was okay at best .
great food great atmosphere great drinks great service definitely going to make this spot a regular .
meh rude staff long wait for average food .
ate here the other night had the lamb osso bucco special fantastic two large shanks at a reasonable price almost couldnt finish but i did too good to waste hope they put on the menu permanently i need to taste it again great place .
killer beer selection really mediocre pizza but no one goes there for the food they should really stay open later .
came in at 1030 with family they close at 11 and were still welcomed and served we had a few drinks and a cheese platter everything was great need to try other dishes next time great vibe great service .
this place does not deserve even one star the womens bathroom was disgusting the salt and pepper seafood plate was very greasy and the duck appetizer was mostly fat really my suggestion close the place and start over .
i am not going to write a long review of this however i am a fan of this place good atmosphere friendly staff good food its the sort of place westville needs more of .
so so it is not good actually .
this restaurant is cozy they provided our film crew with an excellent breakfast sausages eggs ham toast they were quick and helpful .
jaysus this place was rotten noodles which had clearly been in the microwave oven cheap fatty pork beef which didnt really taste of any meat ive had before very cheap and huge portions but i def wont go again .
ive been coming here for years family run reasonable prices and good honest food excellent breakfasts great cobb salad my sister gets one every week and it lasts her all week thats how large it is great club sandwiches great little neighborhood place .
beef chow ho fun zero wok char salty and tasteless young chow fried rice zero wok char tasters like steamed rice with stuff tossed in lobster ok service nonexistent must have thick skin because they might piss you off .
a lot of seating you can probably throw a party here i recommend the new waffle chicken tenders its like fried chicken and waffles combo but with popeyes flavor its so good .
only for roast duck not thing special .
i stopped here just to try there chicken it was very good the food was super hot and the eating area is very nice this would be a great lunch stop .
called them for delivery but the women was completely rude pretending she didnt understand what was i saying and told me that all meat were sold out then hung my phone right after that .
great little neighborhood joint good food nice rustic ambiance one of those ya gotta try at least once places to see if ya like it .
not so great service which based on others reviews was kind of expected the roasted duck was pretty good the lo mein spring rolls were not good at all overall i wouldnt recommend .
absolutely wonderful dinner the food the staff and the ambience were all top notch first time and will definitely be going back parking was difficult but the 10 valet was worth every penny great wine list and extensive menu .
beef tripe was not good little tripe much fat doughwrapped chinese cruller was very bad perhaps day old no texture wonton soup was very bad texture and taste of wonton meat filling was off soup had too much msg and no other flavor .
fantabulousmagnifico food and service and what a todo they have for a celebration and it is also a byob .
the chicken and sweet corn soup was excellent however the spring rolls were too greasy they dripped grease and the sweet and sour pork was toughchewy not good enough for nyc food .
impressive small and old world reminds me of the restaurants in the north end of boston .
the worst roast pork ive ever had dry cold bland not even match my home made version oyster source eggplant is also very oily and bland i cant imagine why its a four star rating at least from a chinese point of view .
my husband and had dinner in the spring it was absolutely wonderful great food great ambience excellent service .
one of the awful restaurants i have ever had we ordered three dishes there and they were all oily and flat my boyfriend even got sick after few hours had their noodles it was a terrible experience and wed never go there again .
my favorite byob in the city and i have been to them all grilled calamari and the intimate atmosphere cant wait to get back .
i came here because of all the reviews but was so disappointed first of all the congee was bland and uninteresting and on top of that i found a hair in my won ton soup not worth it .
everything we ate here was absolutely wonderful and the service was superb would recommend duck orecchiette grilled romaine salad grilled calamari and anything veal great byo wonderful experience .
i had high expectations for this place so i was a bit disappointed most of the greatest chinese restaurant gems do a great job with their fried rice and it was not the case at big wong king i wouldnt go back .
fantastic you couldnt ask for for better service as if they welcomed you into their home .
really disappointed their food lacked flavor and spices that you would expect would not recommend .
very good lunch flexible to create pasta which doesnt exists in menu very good service .
so embarrassed i took my mom here promising good food the food is mediocre at best the place is filthy and the service is not great they also rush you out oh and hot tea in water glasses overrated .
excellent food excellent service everything we ordered was really good reasonably priced too cant say enough good things about this place .
service was bad very quick but the waiter was disrespectful and i do not ask much food was average to acceptable i completely disagree with the average grade of this restaurant authentic for sure but there is a limit to authenticity .
love the atmosphere here great service the food was very very good highly recommended .
this place has gone downhill .
absolutely fantastic although small i highly recommend this restaurant bring your own bottle of wine and enjoy if you have a party of 4 or more call ahead and make a reservation .
do not waste your money on this one maybe it was good in the past but now its just a lot of goopy tasteless brown gravy dishes .
this place is awesome old school italian its kind of off the beaten path but worth it ordered from the daily featured menu and bring yob servers are super attentive and youll leave happy that you came to this restaurant institution in so philly .
the chicken and sweet corn soup was excellent however the spring rolls were too greasy they dripped grease and the sweet and sour pork was toughchewy .
the gf and i have been here twice and both times were fantastic the food is amazing and the byob option is great for an app and two entrees we spent 52 we look forward to multiple return visits .
rude waiters and waitresses .
great food there i never had a bad dish yet since i went there if you like byob and love italian food this is the place to go too i give them 5 stars and 2 thumbs up .
if you do take out better count your change getting the same dish seems to result in fluctuation of change given back amid a very noisy and crowded counter by the register .
great place small so i would recommend reservations the mussels were amazing along with the prosciutto wrapped veal also very good prices would recommend to anyone for a nice date night .
although it looked busy the waiters attitude for a take out order was crap 27 for two mediocre dishes that came dripping with oil would not recommend .
food is fabulous service is terrific the place is full of local charm couldnt have enjoyed our visit more .
this is a typical chinese noodle and duck place it would help if you can order in chinese the waiting can be long for eat in and take out there is no real order in there better to take out and just avoid the chaos .
went back this past weekend food and service were top notch i updated the review to five stars .
whole table got incredibly sick after eating here bacterial infection in the throat not coming back here anytime soon had congee bbq pork and roasted duck over rice wonton noodles and tea not sure which was the culprit .
classic red sauce italian place loud crowded bustling we had like 5 servers but the food was good especially the eggplant and pasta with seafood and the staff was friendly .
when i think jamaican food i think oxtail the oxtail needs major work not good at all .
went to dinner here everything was amazing homemade gnocchi melted in your mouth seafood was fresh cant wait to go back only complaint was the bread didnt taste fresh .
my grilled chicken caesar wrap was very dry making it slightly unpleasant the frites were great nice and chunky the price was cheap .
just delightful best italian meal ive had this side of the atlantic fresh fish is delicious and let the chef prepare his choice of appetizers for your table they were all scrumptious cozy little south philly spot with a great chef preparing quality meals .
weve gone twice fries are good but the kitchen messed up our special dietary request not terrible but we probably wont return .
clean fast fun .
i was looking for a quick lunch during a recent visit to the illadelphyand was excited to see all the options for healthy wraps at this little spot however i have to give them a big boo for lack of flavor and fillings .
this restaurant rocks great food awesome staff always on my short list of places to eat .
the roast pork is amazing the taste the texture the smell its the best if you like tuna fish save yourself the disappointment avoid this spot and go explore the countless other places that are worth your time in park slope .
absolutely delicious with a friendly attentive staff its cozy setting and the fact that its byob made it a perfect place for a date i ate their salmon w tomato potato as my main course had the pumpkin cheesecake for dessert would highly recommend either choice .
just a hangout nothing to rave about grilled corn was what theyre known for its so so .
went again last week and as usual the food was outstanding the portion sizes are just right and the prices are down right incedible i am glad that jessica will not be giving it a second chance its crowded enough as it is .
holy god overrated no food on earth is worth the indignity of the ordering process here .
heavenly calamari not breaded with a lemon garlic and olive oil sauce main dish was good too byob ac nice service and decor .
the food is below average mass produced food with no flavor place is overcrowded and seats are very difficult to find better to look elsewhere .
delicious and authentic the atmosphere is definitely old school italian intimate and basic the food was delicious and the service was great they accomodate all requests and all their choices of homemade pastas are definitely a favorite great meal in this homey byob well be back .
wow i am so over this place the food is ok the drinks way overpriced and the scene makes me want to puke .
wow what a great meal intimate dining and delicious food service was excellent 20 tip i mean what a wonderful dining experience thats very neighborhood and when you enter you walk right through the kitchen and the dining room is in the rear delicious .
awful awful awful nothing in my burrito tasted fresh the chips were stale the salsa was bland the frozen mojito tasted more like a slushee with little or no alcohol do not waste your time .
a wonderful little italian byob food was excellent and worth the money call ahead for reservations as it is a small restaurant highly recommend .
what a horrible place i ordered their salad and it came with wilted greens what was more the guacamole tasted horrible not a good place to eat maybe ok for drinks .
went here on a saturday night this authentic italian byob features entrees that are reasonably priced and perfectly portioned the baked mushrooms made for a perfect appetizer then enjoyed the fillet mignon special which was to die for this byob is a great place for date night .
bar service was not on par as compared to other west hartord center establishments lots of other better choices in the center .
such a great authentic italian restaurant would def recommend this place to anyone looking for a good date spot with great food and service .
waitress and waiters are rude dont go here if you want to watch college football asked the waitress to put on my teams game on one of the small tvs and they did but changed it 2 mins later wont ever go back .
overall great food and a great vibe with reasonable prices wasnt thrilled by the mussels but the lobster ravioli and homemade gnocchi were incredible casual but elegant atmosphere with really nice servers .
perfect pour not any more last 2 times we went there was absolutely no head on our beers we wont be back .
byob in south philly difficult to find parking small little place but great service and great food all the seafood is really fresh grilled calamari appetizer is really delish .
inadequate restrooms expect to wait 20 minutes on a busy night fri sat beer selection is good but sometimes overpriced .
it doesnt get any better than this ask for the artichokes for an apetizer they arent listed on the menu .
west hartford piggy mcdouchefest .
i love the atmosphere at langolos the staff is incredibly nice and the food is great i need to get back there it has been a bit since my last visit .
not impressed wait staff was slow and did not know how to used tabbedout a service they were supposedly offering food was just alright the atmosphere was cool but was the only thing going .
good food most importantly it was quick had party of 8 and food came right out can come back for sure .
blah go to the half door i guess im just too damn old to deal with the douchebaggery that goes on here lots of 20something dudes with baseball hats on .
very good menu plus several specials large portion sizes and many fresh seafood dishes offered you can get your wine next store at uncorked enjoy the atmosphere great service the fettucine was decadent rich no room for dessert though some other time i hope .
too loud and it tries too hard to be an old authentic pub go to the half door .
this spot is soooo great that i am doing this post before i even before i finish my dinner i love the wife and her amazingly welcoming energy and the food is the best .
pizza was probably one of the worse ive had taste like a bad quality frozen pizza wont be ordering from them again .
i had a wonderful time here i had the raw oysters and a fantastic sea bass with a light fresh tomatomushroom sauce with asparagus and potatoes the service was excellent i will definitely be back .
the worst pizza i have ever had the crust tasted like it was mixed with wet newspaper and the sauce had no flavor it was supposed to be sausage peppers onions the sausage was nonexistent the peppers were raw dont bother .
really good place the meat dishes shine portions are huge not overly inventive but solid standards service is excellent vibe is a bit stade and it is in a strip mall but i go back when i can good value in my opinion .
good crowd good location nice people ambiance is average food quality i would say is not that great as hyped by people its average although the quality of roti was good service was very very slow .
never a bad meal although we are seasoned veterans with nicolas so we know what we love here 90 of the time we dont even look at the menu i will always suggest sharing a pasta course of the pappardelle with braised short ribs to die for .
even fair indian is very good diningim a lover of the cuisine but this is middling fare .
byob i have never had a bad meal here here the food is served quality not quantity so if your looking to leave with your pants breaking go to the ev in paterson the fish steaks and pasta dishes are some of the best in the area .
iill continue with this review after i finally eat been waiting 10 minutes with no menu or anything good thing ive got good company to keep me busy so far experience is 0 and im not impressed let me finish this in a few minutes .
really great food family atmosphere nice courteous staff .
food is ok but they directly charge tip on my twopeople bill so i never come back .
after looking for a nice pizza place in bloomfield for months finally found a place in clifton plain cheese slice is really nice garlic bread was different and gooood will surely come again here soon .
what kind of thai food restaurant puts a promotional menu in someones mailbox and then doesnt even offer delivery thats like dangling a juicy herring in front of shamu then when he dives out of the water snatching it away while leering .
ah memories i used to come here after my middle school dances that one slice was delicious and hit the spot service was good too from what i remember havent been since but will soon .
very poor and rude service the owner needs to fire its front desk employees unless the front desk staff are the employees lol food is good though but the staff there has an attitude that makes you cringe i would not go back unless the staff changes .
this is your local go to pizza spot the best round and square slices around its all about the dough .
not a great place to be at food was okayish and i am really mad at them for charging me a service fee for nothing its no value for money .
brunos as good now as it was over 25 years ago the best pizza in the state and the food is always fresh round or square slices you will never be disappointed .
pad thai was dry and not spicy how i asked dumplings where ok price was way too high for level of quality .
try the chicken cordon bleu sandwich one of the best your in for a treat .
food is ok type service vary bad i asked for wated with ice got glass filled with ice waiter told me if i wait for next 10 min this will become water with ice server not frendly i would not not go again .
in a land of bad pizza brunos sicilian or grandma pie is literally amazing i ask for it well done cuz it tends to be too doughy but other than that great sauce and cheese .
the food was below average price was above average ambience was pretty nice staff was friendly enough .
the square pie is really the only thing you ever need from this place its that great the only other noteworthy item on the menu is the mussels other than that the rest of the menu is average and the only reason its not a five star review .
not quite thai flavors were not authentic for thai food staff was malaysian cook seemed to be not thai either poor value for the price setting was attractive .
brunos has the best sicilian pizza you will ever have one of the few reasons i miss living in clifton .
horrible dont even bother .
great pizza and affordable would defiantly go there again .
loved the location and ambiance but the food just was not good overpriced and bland and the broccoli rabe side dish was totally bitter i dont understand this restaurants food concept at all .
you will never have a sicilian pie like it in this country that is what they are known for and what you should order .
2d time the totally disorganized and seemingly random hosts ignored us or gave us a ridiculous wait time never returning the food quality does not outweigh the haughtiness .
the best pizza around and the food is incredible im italian i know try the house salad dressing its homemade unbelievable plus they have wine and beer a plus very reasonably priced dinners fabulous always take food home could never finish the portions are large .
wow breakfast and lunch menu are very overpriced .
brunos sicilian is the best pie i have ever had and it has kept me from sampling their normal cheese pizza the other food can be hit or miss but generally is quite good .
one reviewer here says she lives in fidi omg gives you the picture of who in habits this pretentious place as usual for tribeca hash houses over priced 14 for two eggs oh sorry organic i forgot .
pizza was really good and i enjoyed the salad just as much square pie with a thick dough good amount of cheese so its not overly greasey .
i got the linguini and it was salty im visiting the city and am very disappointed that one of my few meals was here .
hands down best sicilian pizza around i cant attest to any of their other food because thats all i get .
had dinner at locanda last evening meh duck meatballs were dry and had little flavor fava bean crostini was good beet ravioli had a off flavor sunday gravy was good as was the almond semifreddo service subpar .
i can only review the square pie thats all i buy at brunos it is the absolute best sicilian pie anywhere .
usually the food is excellent but i had the porchetta sandwich yesterday and it was way below average a lot of fat and just not the flavor i expected .
they have great food great service and great lunch specials i would like to warn people eating lunch on their lunch hour to bring mints sometimes things are a little garlicy which i love but others sometimes have a problem with .
yummy interesting food went late night noticed a little cafepastry bar otherwise terrible service unfortunate for a place that someone is supposed to enjoy and enjoy spending money will never go back too many other restaurants with so much more to offer .
start your review nice cozy place in rutherford staff was very attentive would recommend to friends and family .
pretty cool scene i guess but the food was nothing to write home about i dont think i will be returning .
amazing food very friendly and accomodating staff seafood paella is the best .
called to make a reservation and they asked if they could put me on hold and i said sure they kept me on hold for almost 10 minutes needless to say i hung up im sure you would have too guess im not going there .
always great food beautiful decor and wonderful friendly staff and owners .
this review is for wedding and similar events we have been there several times and found the food to be poor quality and not much variety the preparations are cheap poor taste and not creative at all .
mambo tea is our go to place for cuban food i absolutely love their cuban sandwich and skirt steak service is always great its also a byob which i love if you havent been and are from the rutherford area you are missing out must try .
the buffet used to be good here the quality has nosedived since our last few visits not even one dish was good all dishes tasted like they were loaded with heavy cream even the dessert fruit custard tasted funny very disappointing .
awesome perfect date place food amazing atmosphere is beautiful music is pleasant .
average food at best nice decor good service probably wait for a while before i go again .
atmosphere and service were great we had a waiter named fabio and he was amazing food was very tasty but the prices here were a bit steep maduros were fantastic overall a nice place but i just wish everything wasnt so expensive .
as i would say for any indian restaurant if you want decent food skip the buffet .
went last night for the first time absolutely fantastic the food was amazing and so was the service i was there with a group of 13 people for a birthday party the manager owner ？ was extremely accommodating and helpful and our waitress was wonderful .
this place has some serious air conditioning issues i went there after 6 years for an engagement party and their ac still didnt work properly these desis are mad cheap with their ac my cousin vicky felt icky from all that sweating .
great atmosphere music and service food 45 stars byob also deducts a point overall not bad maybe ill come back .
worst cheesesteak ive ever had two dry very thin slices of steak and an american cheese single thats it no peppers no onions no flavor served on stale round hard roll ive never seen a cheesesteak not served on a long roll what a disgrace shame .
this is a great little restaurant food is delicious especially the yucca w the garlic dipping sauce service was great and if you bring your own wine they make delicious sangria have been a few times and never disappointed .
im bitter they kicked me off the table because i only ordered tea so i sat on couch .
the atmosphere is really inviting and comfortable the food was amazing fabulous mofongo typical ny area pricing definitely deserves repeat business from us .
worthless they turn off the wifi on sundays now i have a drink and cant get any work done .
great cuban food great mojitos .
ive tried to give this place a shot but theyre way too rude i went there many times for bagels iced tea coffees sandwiches etc everything is relatively average and the fact that the employees are rude kind of negates the whole experience .
we love mambo the food is great the service is excellent always too much food we usually end up ordering the appetizer sampler thats it if you are looking for a yummy byob restaurant do yourself a favor and try mambo .
i ordered an iced mocha with skim milk i got what tasted like a scoop of dirt stirred into milk with ice im not even kidding i let the drink sit in my mouth for a moment ot properly identify the flavor it was dirt fail .
everything was so good especially the maduros and chocolate cake great service as well .
this place is way too bourgeoisie for this neighborhood its like 2 dollars for a small coffee laptop central stupid decor annoying barristas no fair trade coffee and the dumbest name in philly go to ants pants instead .
big fan of cuban food i usually go hear for lunch but have come in for dinner for special occasions cant go wrong with the ropa vieja my other goto dish is the fried pork chunks extra mojo sauce please great all around .
last week i purchased a bag of flat rice noodles from yummy yummy upon opening the bag i discovered a dead centipede i can only imagine what the kitchen conditions must be like for this to happen eat there at your own risk .
quality local spot just the empanadas and tea selection will keep me coming back nice atmosphere good food and friendly service byob no complaints here .
blah you get a whole lot of meat on your sandwich place looks neglected the made another site of of main street that looks a lot better but still its just like a over prices subway .
excellent food and service i particularly enjoyed the shrimp with lime sauce definitely our favorite restaurant in rutherford .
i got food poisoning from eating at this place last thursday 15 i know its this restaurant because i went there with my roommate and she had food poisoning too delicious food too bad you have to wake up at 1am with fever and nausea after eating it .
very good cuba food that u leave full and have a doggie bag for later to eat great for the price and awesome serves mojo plantains and chicken is great good place to just relax and enjoy .
the suckling pig was nothing but pork shoulder served rather nicely .
both food and service were excellent the place was packed when we arrived but we did get a table right away nice atmosphere byob was a plus we will definitely be back .
everything just felt average decent food not bad not overly good decent service not bad not overly good decent atmosphere not bad no overly good decent experience not bad ok you get it .

this is my favorite cuban restaurant and its a byob love the ambiance the live music and the food is awesome .
went for takeout my dogs were wrapped in aluminum and i wished i checked them out before i left i went home to find my dogs were out of the bun and toppings were all over the place never again .
love the food service is great .
run by a bunch of very rude middle eastern dudes who could care less about customer loyalty the pizza is truly mediocre as are the gyros and sandwiches dont bother .
my husband and friends and i came upon this place by pure change and we were favorably surprised with the ambiance the food and the service we had the cochinillo with tostones the chicken in mango sauce and shrimp in lime juice they were all very tasty .
the food was mediocre the problem was the noise we needed to cut our meal short because i developed a terrible headache from everyone shouting over everyone else i would not recommend eating here unless you bring noise canceling headphones even then i would advise against it .
went there after purchasing a groupon and was impressed with the quality of the food it wasnt the best meal ive had but was decent the ambiance there was great and the staff was friendly i would definitely return .
i went last year for restaurant week ive been to a lot of great expensive restaurants in the city and felt the money was worth it that is not the case here overpriced small portions and unimpressive food the parpadella was actually bad .
try the ropa vieja it was great good service and the waiters are always pleasant good food choices and great dinner specials you should stop by and see for your self .
rude arrogant service atleast on the phone i called and asked for menu options for the vegetarians in our party and was told that they had better things to do than answer that arrogant attitude .
it started off as a living social deal and it turns out im a regular now well thats what the server jennifer said .
very unfriendly owner my group was urged to finish dish quickly .
the best yuca i ever had in my life cooked to perfection every time generous portions of fresh wholesome and delicious food impeccable and friendly service and great ambiance with danceable son and salsa and live music woo hoo thursday nights from 630930 .
crappy restarurant with awful service and rude waiter if you are looking for a good byo italian restaurant go to la baia on 17th and lombard .
yummy very authentic .
good service not much ambiance dishes were simply dull there are plenty of byo italian joints in philly so youve got to do better than just putting food on a plate .
enjoyed the churrasco and wife had a killer gallego soup service was great not really a tea person but tried the blood orange tea and was impressed .
never will return the ownermanager was completely rude the place is so tight there was no room to move my seat back felt rushed the food itself wasnt something to brag about much better italian byos in town .
so good everything fried pineapple was great they gave me 2 free sodas price was fair i will definitely be back .
puhlease dont waste your time the food here is nothing special which is the only reason i didnt mind the impossibly small portions maybe the owners should take the fact that were not finishing our impossibly small portions as a hint that the food sucks just saying .
delicious moo goo gei pan chinese food i am so happy that i found you you have the nice other reviewers to thank for this lovely meeting we will meet again soon yeah it happened just like that .
had the fish and chips this time wasnt bad wasnt memorable at all service not memorable either and thats a good thing in this case .

low quality food poor service dirty appearance lowclass diner atmosphere and high prices i hope i wont make the mistake of coming here again .
best chinese food in town an the best service our go to chinese take out place i love the steamed dumplings chicken with broccoli extra extra spicy and the wings .
friday morning totally inept service average at best food completely devaluing the great and deserved reputation of the original location embarrassing .
the beer sampler is kool we liked fruh kolsch not bitter very smooth the burger was go o d fries were average great atmosphere seemed for ever to get food on a sunday at 2pm they were full .
had an oyster po boy terrible nothing like the great sando in the south too few oyster no dressing wrong bread very indifferent service all for 20 just pass and get the raw oysters but that will run you 30 for a plate .
they have an amazing brisket sandwich here id suggest getting it without the cheese the brisket is so good i feel you dont need anything else on the roll they also have a decent section of craft beers .
food was horrible i wanted to gag on my salmon burger lobster sandwich tasted old fruit flies everywhere stay clear .
i come here for brunch almost every sunday always lovely always great the staff are attentive warm and pleasant stay as you are guys and keep on keeping on .
i wish i had checked the reviews grossly overpriced and mediocre food just had the smallest lobster roll i have seen in a long time .
neighborhood feel diverse menu and most important fact is go od beer on tap .
awful caesar mysterious hairs random anchovies hell im not sure what else deuces .
hands down one if my favorites in the city great food friendly and fun staff and all around great place my only complaint is the fries the new ones suck change them back to the old ones .
never again shrimp were over cooked and over breaded if i was in the main location in central station i would have sent it back but here at ewr you just pay and leave then you make a mental note to avoid the place .
very cozy place to escape the snow friendly and quick service good food and great eggnog .
just an average spanish portuguese restaurant i used to go to the one in newark for years and remember it being way better the service is as average as the food they rush you a bit too .
i have a gluten allergy and its really hard to find lunch food that doesnt make me sick and that tastes good the gluten free burger bun is the best ive ever had so good i will be eating a lot of lunches here .
this place is not good everything is so oily and greasy with enormous portions if you are a pig just kidding some ppl might like it .

great beer selection and really yummy food fun atmosphere restored building that overlooks the bf bridge we truly enjoyed the special app fried green tomato stack with feta and balsamic reduction short walk to festival pier so perfect before shows .
ive tried going there and ordering for delivery but find the food very average and the staff very rude and unappreciative of your business .
love having this place in old city the food is great regardless of when youre there lunch brunch or dinner this place is always good negatives bar area is a little small and wait staff is weird .
the worst margherita pizza i ever ate the cheese wasnt even melted at all dry the bruchetta was worse just tomatoes chuck of cheese with no sauce so gross .
excellent craft beer selection cozy atmosphere with the woodburning stove friendly service from the bartenders stopped in here for the first time on a whim saturday night and was very pleasantly surprised this will definitely be added to my list of gotos for good beer in my hood .
this place will always hold a special place in my mind the memory of the worst eggplant parm sandwich i have ever come across haunts my brain i tried my nephews pizza and it wasnt much better cardboard crust and totally flavorless .
love this place i like the staff and the food the beer selection is one the best in the neighborhood and they play albums which is a nice change .
the sauce was really bland for some reason and they charge for ice tea refills without bothering to tell the customer who does that meh .

coffee is ok they do not offer any glutenfree options at their location in graduate hospital which is unfortunate .
this place makes me glad to live in such a good food city ive found it the perfect spot to have a fish sandwich and a beer after a bit of shopping on a weekend afternoon creative enough fast enough plain enough hells yeah .
had not eaten here in decades food was good but service poor had to ask another diner not to use her phone on speaker waitress who didnt offer pepper grinder for salad or meal and forgot tea should have done that would not go back .
great place for lunch really good fries .
very small portions the service was pushy to get us out of there dont go here if you want to be full and want to enjoy your meal .
this cafe looks like a pub but its welllit thanks to a skylight plays great music and features quinoa on its menu their brunch is pretty brilliant huevos san lucas and the atmosphere is rustic and charming .
no air conditioning food has made me sick on a few occasions the coffee and tea is great recommend for coffees to go service is good .
total yumminess .
for a great locale and renovation yet another notquitemediocre restaurant by these owners they buy almost all the cheapest ingredients possible when it first opened my wife and i saw the sysco truck unloading food products and we said uhoh .
like this place a lot warm and inviting the food is good not over the top but when your looking for a upscale homey experience this is the place service is always good and a great selection on tap owners are friendly as well .
over priced mediocre poorly prepared food unfortunate that it is just as bad as abraccio was dont waste your money go down the block to iron hill or the other way to vientiane still the best restaurant in the hood .
we always vied this place as a time suck at lunch on a more recent visit that changed went with work friends for lunch right before the holidays service was friendly menu was solid and the beer selection is fabulous .
went back here a few years later and i think the quality has gone downhill i order the lamb ragu and it was so salty i could barely choke it down shame .
love the beer selection good food specials very good turkey burger good ambiance local art on the walls a quaint place to meet friends eat decent food neighborhood bar .
appetizers came out at the same time as the entrees that makes me mad .
ive been here twice and really enjoyed it both times the food is delish i am a huge fan of the baba ganouj there was a greek platter special and the grilled cheese with ham yum .
came here for brunch and so extremely disappointed not what is expect from a top chef the food lacked flavor and wasnt memorable avoid the short ribs benedict and way overpriced .
wont complain superb drink selection when you want to drink quality beers on a budget food becomes that deciding factor im not here for damn nutrition so hell 2 massive plate of garlic fries plus awesome beers on tap count my ass in cons always packed .
appetizers were great but the main dishes were fair service was a little rough .
excellent beer selection and a woodstove which is key during winter months food was good as well .
service was atrocious .
rock solid beer selection and great pub food nice neighborhood bar .
the beers are expensive the entrees expensive and lacking authenticity the service very sub par great space but the operator needs to make this place a warmer neighborhood dwelling i live in the neighborhood and ive been there twice since the opening .
one of my favorite places in old city very laid back atmosphere cool people great selection of beer and great food .
food was decent but waaaaay overpriced building and staff are gorgeous however .
love it here good food and beer selection in a relaxed environment even on weekend nights it doesnt get totaly packed so you feel like you can still breathe and actually hear the people you are out with highly recommend the shrimp enchiladas soooo yummy .
thumbs down for enticing me in with a level up discount and then not being able to scan my code wont be back .
excellent low key midpriced barrestaurant to grab a drink or meal on a weekday evening good food good prices chill atmosphere patio seating quiet street tucked slightly out of the way .
every time i order fuel on grubhub my food comes so soggy and cold its gross and never good the only things they can seem to do right are their juices .
hidden away in the corner of whete race st and bridge st meet unbelievable brunch the baked eggs havana was spicy and very flavorful service was not pushy and helpful very quiet relaxing cafe prices are reasonable .

great weekend afternoon spot nice specials and the wings are addicting get them well done good beer selection big windows and friendly staff make this a great place to sip away a lazy afternoon .
awesome food and smoothies its a shame their customer service is terrible even if the place isnt crowded plan on waiting for your waiter if the food wasnt worth it i would not visit here .
hidden gem in olde city went here during first friday and was impressed although not an extensive menu the food is good and the drink selection offers something for everyone world away from the market street scene just a few blocks away you can also eat outside .
as i was eating i couldnt believe that one of the wait staff was repeatedly wiping his nose and carrying out food without washing his hands i saw him rinse his hands in a sink but did not use soap lost my appetite i wont eat there again .
this place is probably the first place for a beer if youre walking into old city from the comfort inn the atmosphere and beer selection is what make this bar different than the others in the area the food is good and the service was just fine .
just ordered a delivery sloppily put together because they were closing i suspect worst pizza i have ever had had a lot of pizzas and this was the worst sucked ate one piece sooooo salty .
nice as bars go ive been there twice and never had any food and was very pleased a casual atmosphere and good beer selection with a few tvs for watching a game .
this place is terrible i can confirm how terrible it is after 2 deliveries im posting a picture of the pizza i recently had delivered that had all the cheese flipped off the pie and sitting on one end of the box do not buy from this place .
great beer and wine amazing service the food can be good or just okay depending on what you order we go back for the location atmosphere and service its nice to find a place in old city to just grab a beer and enjoy a beautiful day .
took an hour and 15 minutes to deliver pizza was not mediocre it was downright bad the crust was burned the pizza was cold the sauce had no flavor and the veggie toppings i paid extra for were laughably sparse do not recommend .
good food that is more than your standard pub fare good beerwine list great atmosphere the chili was especially good id order it again the roast beef sandwich was delicious the turkey burger was just okay ill definitely be back to try more of the menu .
i got a delivery of half cheese half bacon and fried ravioli the pizza was mediocre at best but the fried ravioli was pretty good the delivery service was great and it was nice to order online .
short on time for lunch nss has both new england and manhattan clam chowder ready to go its one of my favorite feel good foods tastes homemade and has the freshest ingredients you cant lose for six bucks .
pizza arrived fairly quickly flavor was good but pizza was cold only had to travel 2 miles to get to my destination so not sure why it was cold delivery driver very nice would not order again though .
best fresh tuna sandwich ive ever eaten so fresh so delicious also very good french fries would definitely recommend this place to anyone that likes seafood has a pretty large menu with lots of options i visit this place every time im in princeton .
quite possibly some of the driest worst pizza i have ever had and they were late .
stop buying seafood in restaurants and spending lots of here you have the best sandwiches chowder fish and chips and tacos youd ever find in princeton love to love it .
ordered the pizza late night because we had no other options pizza was terrible and the salad i ordered for my daughter made her tongue tingle what happy that every ting was alright after she ate that if i could give a lower review i would .
great for its tiny size high quality fresh fish and produce especially the fruit some preprepared foods .
save your money gross took over an hour to have pizza delivered to the best western it was stone cold with congealed cheese not all the toppings that we ordered were on it next time i will walk back to penn station for that pizza there .
some of the market items here can be a bit overpriced but the lunch special is truly great its very affordable and you get a huge serving of fish on a sandwich with a side of fries one of the bets lunches in town .
worst pizza ever ordered some pies for a school event everyone hated me for 2 months after eating that crappy slob of dough avoid for the sake of friendships .
the best grilled salmon sandwich ive ever had .
this place was highly recommended we went in on a sunday afternoon and the place was nearky deserted the food was subpar and the service bad our waiter talked back when we were just poibting out that a plate was missing .
great little fish market near princeton univ we had the blackened catfish sandwich with fries for lunch good portions and reasonable priced outdoor seating or they may let you sit in their restaurant next door its also across the street from a bike shop that sell trek bikes .
tried their roast beef taste was rather bland for the hype beef was cut way too thick and it was way too dry french fries was the run of the mill broad fries from the bag bartender was very friendly .
this place rocks where else will you find sea urchins but at nassau seafood .
the food was just ok but we got really crappy service and i would probably not go back again if i had any choice in the matter plus i feel like the price was just out of range for what you were gettingeven in olde city .
top quality products this place goes direct to the fulton fish market every morning to hand pick products for sale of course you pay for it it is a bit overpriced but if you want good fish this is where you should go .
this is actually the worst restaurant ive ever been to in philly and i was born in a restaurant in philly okay it was a hospital cafeteria but it counts the food was terrible the service was the same .
best vietnamese sandwiches nough said .
we came in and ordered the service was nice but the food was very greasy overall there are better places to eat in newark and north jersey .
oki just gotta give ya the 5 stars consistently on point and so damn good .
had a sandwich corned beef reuben it was okay nothing special .
tried the coconut curry beef currently my favorite sandwich so delicious always consistent always fresh highly recommended .
decent food but meat is routinely on the fatty side good service terrible management and decor its not worth another trip business thrives due to proximity to the courts if there were another decent deli in the vicinity theyd have a long overdue wakeup call .
well make sandwich fresh ingredients and delicious salads too .
good but not the best hobbys is my third favorite out of my three top picks i did a side by side of my 3 favorites .
7 50 for the pork banh mi and took 1015 minutes but it was tasty bread was nice and toasted but not as light and flaky as i like it .
as other poster has stated nothing special to compare this place to katzs is ridiculous the pastrami and corned beef where sliced so thin you cant compare this to katzs hand sliced meats the sandwich was quite small for 12 50 dont know where the overstuffed sandwich was .
best bahn mi ive ever had sometimes the sandwiches are sold out by the end of the day presumably due to running out of their amazing bread pretty sure they get it fresh daily from little italy .
great views of the hudson river but a little pricey and in a very congested area along the hudson river walkway not my kind of place ultimately but i do enjoy having some options on the water on the upper west side .
best banh mi on town bread is toasted perfectly and homemade pâté adds a social taste make a trek all the way here from queens to feed y craving .
can you please change the sangria recipe back to the original it was much better also please stop making spaghetti you are bad at it .
got the zon sandwich it was the truth it was so good i was able to make out the la virgen in my sandwich twas downright spiritual i am now closer to god bc of my food experience here .
i personally thought it was expensive and the location this is why they didnt last .
i really enjoyed my sandwich and i would definitely come back in the future the sandwiches are made fresh so it was a 1015 min wait the place is very small but there are a couple of tables .
when they actually get your order right the food is great unfortunately i cant remember that ever happening its the only reason im glad i moved to newington the wings over newington actually consistently gets my order right .
i think their american style vietnamese sandwiches are tasty they used a vaeiety of spices and sauces to season the meat the baguette was crispy definitely worth going to .
extremely rude staff delivery driver didnt get out of car and deliver to door excellent value .
you gotta love this place excellent sandwich delicious pork chop over rice not to mention the inside is impeccably neat .
the food is ok had the ribs on saturday they were the worst piece of charcoal burnt low grade dog food i ever had would not recommend that store maybe a different store but not that one .
great little family owned place i had the pork banh mi it was delish the bread was fresh and tastey the sause they use had just the right amount of heat it was a treat for sure .
i would definitely give 0 star if theres an option its very impolite to ask people to move to other table twice in 5 minutes no wonder why other reviews mentioned about the terrible service .
love it i always get the chicken sandwich one and recommend it as well one of those hole in the wall places walk downstairs and you have this small viet sandwich shop there are a few seats if youd like to stay and eat .
a disappointment the chicken breast tarte flambee had a couple microscopic shreds of chickenor was it chicken the 8 glass of red wine tasted like grape juice not a good value meal as someone posted really yelpers you let me down .
so far the best banh mi ive had in the city it is put together with care and it shows the bread is to die for perfectly crispy with an incredible taste not much to write other than everything was perfect .
i was very disappointed with this place service was lousy the waitress forgot our drinks even after we got our salads and flambé we had to ask for them and didnt even get an apology the actual flambé was cold and not flavorful .
worth the wait it takes to get your food everything is made fresh to order and you can tell the bread is crispy and delicious and the coffee is tasty the place itself is tiny but spotlessly clean .
nothing special i hate that i wasted my time trekking up there just to get a flat piece of dough with some sugar on it really yelpers you let me down .
fresh and very tasty both salads and sandwiches are delicious their business hours however are a little strange this place stays closed on mondays and is not open before noon .
the ingredients didnt meld tasted like bread and cream together .
perfect summer rolls .
the tartes kind of like little pizzas with very thin crusts are yummy enough but they are served on a splintery slice of thin plywood i kid you not i wont go back it was almost disgusting how did they clean these things .
really good zon sandwich and the green papaya salad is very tasty order at the counter small dining room seemed like a cute family owned restaurant .
i did not get as far as the food or service i walked in saw unswept floors and dirty tables and immediately asked myself whether this was indicative of the condition of their kitchen then i walked out .
this must be the best pulled porkgrilled chicken banh mi ive ever had the bread is absolutely pefect so crisp no hurting the roof of your mouth ingredients are fresh and overall the flavor is incredible .
very slow if you dont have much time between flights dont stop here it took a half hour just to get drinks the food is typical mediocre airport faire .
really nice place everything made meticulously by hand good banh mi very nice summer rolls green papaya salad best vietnamese in ev at present .
good wine great service just a little to expensive to hang out wanted some cheaper options on the menu .
delicious wish they had more seating but luckily i came on a slow day so it wasnt an issue .
place was a disaster the service is horrible we waited 50 minutes for food to come out when we were one of the first people here the table who arrive 15 mins later received their food before us bypass this location and go to another .
very tasty i love the chicken sandwich the bread is always fresh .
service was slow and the food was ok nice glass of wine and a good spot to watch the passing crowd .
best ive had .
miserable service french onion soup good .
ordered a chicken sandwich for dinner to go thought it was fairly enjoyable the meat was a bit too salty but the bread was soft and warm and the sandwich was pretty satisfying the spicy option provides a nice tingle on the tongue .
stay far away this place sucks rude and ex cons deliver the food we got sick for a week eating from neptune cafe and i will never order from them again theres much better places nearby to order from .
i really love the iced vietnamese coffee from this place its so damn good well it may sound crazy but i really dont get the banh mi just the coffee lol .
horrible everything .
crisp and refreshing banh mi sandwiches in a tiny space .
french toast is excellent side salad was tasty omelet was wet and runny roast potatoes were bland service was cold but not rude .
tasty sandwich very friendly staff they do take credit 15 minimum .
the food is not as good as other restaurants in lic its pricy and tasteless the drinks and desserts are not bad if you go try to skip the dishes and just get the drinks and desserts .
cutiepie place having the zon so yummy no cilantro no spicy its lightly sweet jus like muah love this cute little wooden tray its served on .
the worst pad thai ive ever had i will not order again .
masarap delicious in tagalog speed up the service though .
quality food nice size servings general tsao chicken too sweet we even asked for spicy other dishes purchased were ok .
terrific banh mi sandwich with perfect sized baguette crispy spicy cool crisp and tasty sandwich the green papaya salad was fine and the fresh limeade light on the sugar was the perfect accompaniment id go again in a heartbeat .
ive never had anything really good from here basic chinese takeout with a higher price tag caters to the american taste no special chinese veggies spicing or flavors meh at best supposed to be open till 9 but they dont answer the phone after 845 .
lovely lunch spot in the east village near tompkins square park high quality ingredients bright flavors pleasant decor and attentive servicedefinitely returning here also the vietnamese coffee really is delicious .
pros inexpensive local hang out cons crowded slow service pizza undercooked and appeared rushed dated interior which i guess some like for the nostalgia the place is crowded a lot so they must be doing something right though .
yum everything is fresh and of high quality try their vietnamese coffee its delish i will go back again for lunch .
come on fellow yelpers this pizza is horrible i ordered a large pie and it was a soggy mushy mess the part i could eat had zero i repeat zero flavor ive had better frozen pizzas stay away .
yummy have to go back and try the other sandwiches we had the sardine sandwich reminds me of a sandwich i used to have in srilanka .
brought my appetizer after my entree and staff did nothing about the lady playing her kids tv show out loud on her ipad for the whole dining room to hear food was alright but probably wont be coming back .
wow awesome bahn mi very fresh ingredients yummy crunchy soft baguette and flavorful chicken definitely will be back d .
dumpling was not so good too sweet chiefs special noodle was reasonable but it was also too sweet the fried rice was ok but not great .
helllllllllaaaaaaa good ive had many in california in little saigon where all the vietnamese people are and this one blows them out of the water i had the pork banh mi eat it .
food not fresh you can taste that it has been refried several times joes may have a wait but the food is worth the wait here the food is fast but not very tasty would not return here .
best sandwiches and best fresh lemonade lovely people wonderful service super clean beautiful photos of vietnam taken by owner just the type of place you want to see more of i will go back again and again and again reasonable prices .
food was so so but the people are so mean really bad service wont come anyone .
excellent inexpensive tasty .
uneven excellent hot and sour soup and soup dumplings some of the other dishes were not very good .
mmm zon sandwich remain me of some home cooking toppings the place small is and declarative so dont come in big group or you always good idea order to go they take only cash but the price is reasonable too bad they dont half a star to rate .
not bad the buns are garbage but the rest of the food is edible .
i will be frequenting this little sandwich joint really fresh great ingredients and perfect bread .
came here for valentines day service was great the california merlot was awesome but the beef portfolio in a red wine reduction was absolutely terrible i cant even finish this review because just thinking of it makes me queeeezy 3 stars for me .
this place is a nice find close to my apt my roommate and i often hit this place up sandwiches are bigger than nickys and the ingredients taste fresher to me all in all we have a winner .
everything was bland and tasteless including the waitress had the pollo limone a flavorless slab of meat that must had laid in the freezer long past its due date .
i recommend the classic ask for it spicy with an ice coffee to be had while sitting on the window facing tablestool watching east village passes by pick a day any day it will be a good day for a banh mi .
this place is very nice the people running it are very nice the food seem very fresh unfortunately the sandwhich i had was very blaaah i .
great banh mi a little different from nickys but just as good this place doesnt loop classic simpsons episodes like nickys does but it has more seating room i had the classic sandwich hancos in brooklyn is still the best banh mi .
subs were just ok delivery was fast customer service when placing the order was horrific if youre going to hire young adults they need to have people skills when dealing with customers .
wasnt a huge fan of the gluten free pizza but the inside of calzones are awesome salads are decent enough cant beat being across the street from a good take out place .
i was a guest for a rehearsal dinner so i didnt get the typical customer experience but the pasta was al dente so thats always a plus .
yum best glutenfree pizza in town so far we recommend the chicken alfredo white pizza or the buffalo chicken pizza yum .
wasnt thrilled with their lunch buffet selections i had to take mine to go and the waiter gave me a dusty togo container the best part of my lunch experience was the naan i will most likely not come back here .
great place got huge salads with fresh ingredients delivered came with free garlic knots too .
good consistently cold beers to choose from on tap bacon wrapped chicken bites were delicious the prices are way to high for the area and the amount of food you are receiving the burger tasted like a frozen patty service downstairs is better than upstairs .
frequent patron the wings are always amazing and you get ample blue cheese dipping sauce which is especially delicious plus celery and carrots the carrots are a nice addition the pizza is nothing special but its still a good standard pizza that goes well with the wings .
i brought my friends from out of town to hai kitchen because of the multiple positive reviews not only was the staff rude but the food was over priced and the food was horrible it was just americanized sushi in burrito form i would have paid 5 max .
yum thats all i can say i crave this pizza sad i live in pitt and cannot get it frequently order an extra side of sauce to dip your crust into and you will be very happy .
one sentence can summarize my experience here i can make better kimbap at home that tastes better and cheaper than hais kitchen sadbuttruestory .
so its not great new haven pizza true they are still an awesome place plus they deliver ive had almost all of their pasta dishes the subs are great the salads are amazing and their pizza is pretty good actually lots of choices and great veggie options .
if you dont like sushi you wont like this place the seaweed wrap is xtrastinky definitely wished i had the 20 minutes back that i stood in line .
these are the best burgers in staten island and dont forget the onion rings .
speaking only for the drinks this place is a little weird my friend bf and i ordered milkshakes and they were just not good how do you mess up a milkshake more importantly how does a garces restaurant mess up a milkshake bizarre .
excellent burgers last time i had the bleu cheese bacon burger that and a cold brew and things dont get any better the service is good despite how busy it gets .
the old king chef was much better i didnt like this place great location though i dont think i would go back .
best burgers ever love how they use english muffins as the buns less bread more meat yumm .
low price and low quality basically getting what you pay for the staff and atmosphere is a nice change the sushi plates are all empty and thats very unpleasant looks like you are eating scraps .
forget the burger this place has the best french onion soup in staten island they are not cheap with the cheese and melt it it on top just a little burnt which to me is perfect .
2nd time i have ordered 1 hour later it shows up never again both times delivery was absurdly late cheese smeared all over call them of course im put on hold .
i believe this is simply enough i love their burger and crisscut fries .
cheesesteak tasted like dirty grill chicken francaise tasted like lemon juice and they couldnt even do french fries right better off with literally any other pizza place in town .
spent some time with a group of guys while the ladies were at a bridal shower great service by a waitress who seemed to be handling the whole place by herself delicious burger as advertised one less star because no guiness on tap in an irish pub .
comon people are they paying you to leave reviews the worst in bloomfield all the food is bland and for a place that is slow its a long wait .
this is the place to get a hamburger who new ground beef can taste so good on an english muffin and the cris cut fries are awesome .
the service is really great the place is clean and welcoming and the ingredients fairly fresh but unfortunately the chef is incapable of delivering an acceptable pasta dish even though the recipe was very simple just very bland and no flavor i definitely dont recommend this place .
best burger on staten island check the og burger on an english muffin check duffys is the quintessential irish pub that happens to have the best hamburgers ever .
mediocre food and terrible service 40 minutes for a simple lunch order one item didnt come and another was wrong do not eat here .
as always great burgers .
overpriced pub fare plastic tables and chairs on patio crammed into too small area no ambience as this was originally an actual ice house should get rid of the pretentious attitude and simply be a pub note service as average but pleasant .
i cant say anything bad about this place i will def recommend to everybody 2 thumbs up .
place was so so recommended by aaa but felt it wasnt anything that special hostess was nice waitress was so so food ok but nothing spectacular coffee came in a dirty glass .
order a cheeseburger .
the food is not worth the price at all enough said get a drink on the deck in the summer thats about it .
i love dive bars and bar food whats better than a chargrilled cheeseburger on an english muffin with waffle fries theres obviously other items on the menu but every time i come i cant get myself to pass up a duffys burger .
dont go too early because they revive left over food from the previous day experienced this on my first visit and have not and will not go back again there are better restaurants out there that i will give my money to .
burgers are what we went for and what we got they were infact very good the best burger i ever had well not the very best however most likely in the top ten the cozy feel and service did also add to why one would try lunch here .
drove here to try some of their delicious food and they were closed closed on a saturday at 3pm i dont get it i will make another visit and hope to try their food out this left a bad taste in my mouth .
i got a swissburger and ordered it medium well for the first time in my life i got it the way i ordered it it was not burned to a crisp as i enjoyed it i noticed the place was spotless yowsah ill be back .
cold everything soup eggs sausage done have given this three chances now and always the same slow also .
excellent burger and seasoned fries beer selection could be better .
so sad to retract my previous review last time i went and will ever go was terrible rude mentally challenged desk staff plus hollandaise sauce from a canyuck .
best burgers on staten island no question .
i think this place is overrated the food is par with many other restaurants in burlington and not worth the hype its disorganized and the clientele is very annoying not worth the trip stick to sneakers and penny cluse .
we have been going at duffys for years every time we are in town to visit my parents we have to go to duffys this is suck a great small place with some amazing burgers and beer love this place .
pizza was days old the cheese was extremely oily the staff two women were extremely rude never coming back .
great hamburgers .
cheap salty cheese flavorless sauce you get what you pay for only plus is their hours .
best burger on staten island .
used to think this place was good until i ordered the chicken parm and saw a cockroach walking on the floor should have cut my loses there but my stomach rejected it later that night .
best burger so juicy on a large english muffin get the waffle fries and you will not be disappointed .
half the time the bread on their sandwiches is stale really not acceptable especially when the sandwich is 8 dollars im not giving this cafe any more chances best to just go to the coop to grab something to eat .
check out my review here dayofitnyc wordpress com… .
pathetic very unprofessional people we had a deal for party hall and then they turned down the deal i do not want to comment about food quality because i never been there to eat but i dont like the treatment which they give to customers .
great food and service the mussels in red sauce were fantastic and the sauce was perfect for dipping the fresh bread calamari was fresh and crispy highly recommend the bronzino or veal with jumbo lump crab meat great quality food in a rustic atmosphere strongly recommended .
worst service kids are running this restaurant i order 6 items and they forgot to serve 2 items out it waiter were not paying attention on tables and were busy in talking to each other .
walked right up and sat outside the servers were prompt and attentive we went with kids and they brought the food right out for them food quality was good as well although when dining with kids that is often secondary .
this place is nasty and the whole area around this place smells so bad .
pretty decent food and good service im giving 3 stars for the food but 4 stars for the fact that they squeezed us in last minute right at closing time .
thought it was mediocre at best my husband is notorious for taking leftovers even from other peoples homes he didnt take his home that said everything to me the thin crust pizza we got was a cracker with sauce and cheese .
went here for my birthday with a group of old friends everybody loved what they ordered and had an excellent time my fiancé and i both ordered the veal and were very pleased excellent ambiance service and food cant wait to go back soon .
calamari was underwhelming and pricey pizza there is gourmet and amazing be sure to order drinks are pricy and a little on the small side pasta is by good decent portions .
the best meal we had in philly this place is awesome even the kids cleaned their plate the combination desert platter is a good way to try a little bit of everything .
foods overpriced and not that good service is better at chipotle up the street .
the crab ravioli was excellent our server was very knowledgable and attentive i would highly recommend spassos .
pros good wine decent appetizers friendly host and server cons bland food vodka sauce was weak in flavor chicken was overdone pasta was overcooked west hartford prices 20 for bland pasta dish really overall i will not be returning to rizzutos or recommending it any time soon .
loved the authentic atmosphere attentive service great food affordable parking across the street 2 00 per hour .
i was not impressed with the food and the overall woodfired taste that permeated almost every dish the atmosphere is nice .
delicious food big portions restaurant is busy every night and can become a loud atmosphere .
shame love their pizza will never order their wings again .
excellent food super clean inside and a nice atmosphere one of the best italian places in philadelphia if you like actual italian food .
lets see like a half of a tail of a lobster that looks to me to small to legally harvest 2 shrimp partially cleaned grits 22 dollars hahahahahahah oh gawd people are so stupid .
having dinner at spassos blood orange red martinis shrimp bisque soup and caesar salad lobster strudel in white wine sauce and linguini parmasean w shrimp n crabmeat ummm ummm good .
the food was tasty but service is a true deal breaker for me the server was not attentive at all and i did not feel welcomed .
on a saturday night we had a reservation for 14 with 3 kids the food was very tasty also the service was fast a great experience .
worse service ever the host was so rude girl with the ponytail stop it .
this is by far my most favorite italian food on the planet ive never been to italy tho ive been coming here for years and its consistently delicious i highly recommend to anyone that is in the old city area .
imitation soul food unremarkable service bomb violin player the manager was nice though .
love the food and staff not much more to say other than enjoy your meal .
met up with a friend for brunch here service was great handsome waiters lol and loved the atmosphere here but the food was not all its cracked up to be the mac and cheese tasted like onion power and the red velvet waffle was dry and spongy .
good price great food and cant beat the location service is okay and good size dishes we had different pasta dishes and all of them were delicious probably one of the best italian restaurants in old city .
the food was not as good as i thought it would be the waiter john michael was great though .
everything was delicious i highly recommend everything we got grilled calamari grilled to perfection crab ravioli zuppa di pesce lots of seafood our favorite of the night paparadelle procini the pasta was a bit too hard for my taste but the flavor was great .
kudos for more dining choices in the area too bad our food was just kinda bleh maybe i wanted to like the place too much friendly staff so that at least ups the review a star .
excellent crab jumbo cake salad overall wonderful meal we had the veal porcini and it was good portions huge so we split dish would go to again .
waitress tabs was excellent but other than that you had to wait awhile for your food the cocktails with delicious names needed a little more alcohol and the food was just alright ambience is great this place would do well as a drinks and appetizer kind of place .
great service great food and authentic .
i had the smallest most expensive smoothie ever 7 50 for a strawberry pineapple banana with ginger it was just okay .
shrimp feuttcini is nice and creamy and the veal and crab was divine yummy yummy sauce our bread was a little cold but the main entrees were very enjoyable .
be very attentive when paying they tend to charge some extra pennies and blame it on the computer second time it has happened to me in addition its very expensive and tasteless i guess it must be uber healthy .
this place ha s the best service and food highly recommended .
overpriced for a sandwich that was stale and tasted like airport food .
a nice place in the heart of philadelphia old town servers were friendly 4 or 4 5 stars .
most of the food is delicious most of the employees are rude they take away from what could be a really nice experience .
service was great and food was delicious .
overpriced stale tasting food .
food was amazing awesome atmosphere and the staff was very friendly highly recommend the salmon .
worst sourest espresso i have ever tasted .
was visitingphiladelphia for a couple of nights went to spasso in a saturday night there was a nice size crowd dining the service was very good as was the food the portions were just the right size was ever rushed .
old tavern was better in every respect each time i come here the food gets worse they have a great beer selection but the taps are always pretty gross which makes your beer awful dont bother coming here at night unless you want to have some alone time .
excellent italian cuisine my family and i enjoyed it the veal and crab entree was delicious .
still the same drab place having changes the beer selection in 6 months no local craft beers on tap air conditioning broken not sure j want to test the food .
sat outside for lunch the food was outstanding i had the seafood papadelle their wednesday special perfectly cooked pasta with and incredibly luxurious pink sauce i will definitely be back soon .
not to trilled ask for medium burgers and both were way over done and dry wasnt a fan most likely wont return back .
we came here because my husband bought the groupon it was delish the waiter was awesome the wine was great and the atmosphere is romantic get the lobster ravioli .
update still played out but now the monkey bar is played out too .
absolutely great food wine and overall experience highly recommend gorgonzola gnoochi .
bands here are hit and miss douchey employees and expensive beer are a sure thing charge full cover until 130 which is bullshit id only recommend it if you absolutely love the band playing .
great food but slow service .
ordered the salmon salad salmon was good but salad was not just a plain salad and it cost almost 10 had to add my own dressing and croutons when i got home definitely not worth the price .
a perfect meal everything was amazing four cheese ravioli crab and veal tiramisu and cannoli .
terrible hummus not true to any origin lame .
always delivers a good meal i really like the veal medallions with demi glace .
i had the shawarma bland greasy chicken no flavor fries were soggy and crap hummus okay many food trucks are better at serving this type of food i shall not return .
very good food service was a bit spotty dessert portions are huge so make sure you leave space great vodka tonic to start .
long lines chilly inside and food wasnt as good as i was hoping it had a funny after taste .
visiting philly for the a10 baseball tournament found this amazing restaurant with the help of yelp everyone in our party loved their meal my husband said he would come back to this area just to go to spasso .
horrible food poisoning after having frog legs here never again .
chose this for a valentines day dinner the atmosphere was what we were looking for it was a little loud but the people near us were just screaming the bottle of water on the table didnt leave you thirsty and the food was outstanding .
just two stars got a steak but it certainly wasnt restaurant quality when you need to spit out the second bite because of gristle you pretty much know what youve gotten yourself into .
homestyle italian feel enormous and tasty portions most delicious cheesecake great for groups .
awful very oily pad thai i ordered 2 00 extra tofu it comes in another container i clearly wanted it in my pad thai not in another container this restaurants food is terrible in my opinion verona chineses food is better and very close to healthy chinese .
been here numerous times if you are in the mood for italian go you wont be disappointed .
i never knew healthy food meant tasteless food pass the sirachi sesame oil ill even take ketchup just put some flavor in this soup please .
appetizer caprese salad and bruschetta both mmmmmmmmmm for the main event i had shrimp and pasta and my boyfriend had veal all very yummy nice waiters and nice atmosphere and not too pricey .
we use to eat here and the soup really good but one day we go eat there again omg the noodle soup is no good then we not go there any more sorry .
this is the best italian restaurant i have ever been to the sauce is only rivaled by my italian mother .
said they would be open until seven then left us out in the snow when we showed up at 630 after we walked through the snow for half an hour .
very consistent restaurant that serves satisfying italian food nice decor good service and very good food for the money relaxed dining experience and a good value been there a few times and have not been disappointed .
i really wanted to like this place first ive only heard good things about pho ha second pho ha has a parking lot unfortunately it just did not live up to the reviews on yelp and id rather look for parking for hours than eat soso pho .
i loved loved loved this place it made me actually crave snails i think thats pretty impressive .
this place is the biggest dump ever food sucked and i had to stop to shit my brains out .
great service good coffee and bagel i accidentally spilled my cup and they gave me a new one free of charge even after i insisted on paying .
i really dont understand why this restaurant is getting good reviews the food is mediocre the waiter was rude at times and the place need some serious up grade just dont go to this place is a waist of money an time .
for the first time in my life i am drinking a pumpkin spice latte that is absolutely delicious and not loaded with sugar the barista made the pumpkin spice himself which he showed me it is so damn good .
food overpriced service terrible if your over 60 this is the place not place for 2535 yr olds if it wasnt for patio this place wouldnt be open .
a welcome change from the rest of the cafes in the area the guy makes his pumpkin spice mix from scratch and its good skip the starbucks check out lunas .
i ordered a pizza around 1030 when they close at 11 i ran over to acme and came back these dirtbags put a cold pizza in the box and it wasnt what i ordered please do not order from these crooks .
favorite coffee place in this city coffee is exceptional staffservice is awesome basically hands down my favorite coffee experience if you love coffee forget all your other spots and run here its an epicurean revelation enjoy .
the food was food but it took 2 hours for the food to come not happy the servers werent happy or helpful i was an awful restaurant based on food service .
great coffee great service cute atmosphere would highly recommend .
very poor quality food everything tasted commercially prepared out of a premade container problems with their customer service also maybe a good place to get a drink and watch a game but not for dinner .
friendly staff great lattes and plugusb outlet great 1st experience will probably be my go to place when i need to wait for my friend to get off of muay thai class .
ok place to get some decent bar food the service was a little slow but ok i found a better place around the corner with music and good food .
quiet lovely delicious staff is super friendly and nice amazing coffee which really is all i want in life .
i went there before a hartford whale game in february we got there at 5 o clock and the game started at 7 we did not get our food until 7 and ended up missing half the game .
decent coffee free wifi lots of outlets few people good place to set up for a couple hours of work .
i was expecting tasty spicy food i have to agree with the reviewers who found the food bland the sauce in the cashew nut rice dish was watery tasteless the added pork had no seasoning and was a bit on the dry side im not a fan .
best sushi for about an hour radius hands down .
went there for lunch after hearing it was great i had vegetarian pad thai and it was ok at best there was nothing wrong with it it was just not tasty i was very disappointed because i love thai food .
nice wait staff up front workers not as much so really liked the food staffer was smoking right outside the back door or i would have offered 5 stars instead of 4 .
best of hartford really it was just okay i miss lemon grass .
i love this place wonderful service and that male manager is the best always has a great smile and damn is he dapper .
the best part about this place is the wallpaper the food is not bad its fine nothing special so i dont get why its expensive i was really shocked that the quality did not match the price .
great ceviche style appetizer fresh sushi and good habachi good selection of saki and mixed drinks .
its not lemon grass food was so so gave my wife heartburn all night the best was the martinis very cold very dry and very large kevin the bartender is great after two of them i could eat anything .
wonderful delicious great service and great food been here dozens of times never a bad experience best sushi in glastonbury .
went there for dinner on a whim with my fiance food just ok not bad but nothing to brag about either .
went there on a sunday for a dinner with good friend very last minute pick and all day sunday is half priced sushi wow i thought their sushi was very decent the prices cant be beat decor relaxing and funky the place was packed .
wow unbelievable customer service wouldnt waste my time here if there is udupi right down the street food is as good as udupi and they have a better variety but the waiter and manager there need to learn some manners on how to treat their customers .
this is a great place for sushi great decor ambiance and of course wonderful sushi .
nothing to write home about food was of average quality sambar was the worst i have had in the recent times .
happy hour here is fantastic a great selection nice outdoor seating and just really good food the pork gyoza and vegetable tempura are both great and of course the sushi .
the food is ok absolutely nothing special but not disgusting but the problem is the really amateurish rude waiters who ignore customers and just dont provide any level of service overall very blah .
great portuguese cuisine and amazing wine .
absolutely the worst food i have ever eaten they served instant potatoes and rubber roastbeef for 13 .
still the best burger in philly when they are on point the desserts and shakes are excellent too also their prices are extremely reasonable a fully decked out burger with egg and bacon is only 8 95 what .
not the best diner ive eaten at but okay for being local the service is spotty few good waitresses work here .
soooo much food really easy to accidentally over order get the mac and cheese it was fabulous the vegan burger was really heavy but tasty especially with the horseradish cheese make sure you bring your a game to draw your most creative burger as for mine fail .
this is the worst breakfast in a diner i have ever had eggs benedict with lox i had to vomit after i ate it felt sick all day sucks .
awesome place best burger in philadelphia as far as i am concerned village whiskey might be slightly better but much more expensive i recommend without reservations .
ordered for delivery it arrived in about 30 minutes good but the lasagna was blah ive had better .
the burgers are awesome and they delivery to my house score .
this shouldnt even be called a pizzeria it is bland the sauce is probably ragu and they use fake cheese its greasy the true sign of fake cheese on a pie ive had better frozen pizza .
vegan shakes the size of a small country so good have yet to eat here but will be back for sure .
i used to love this place until i got a bad case of food poisoning could have been from chicken sandwich or the 16 year old kid handling my sandwich but it was from there and it was the worst i dont think this place is very sanitary .
huge vegan milkshakes pretty good burg as well rotating seitan specialnot as good as the burg fills up at lunch time but def worth the wait .
the service was excellent i have been here a few times the first time i loved the food and each time there after the food has become significantly less impressive which is a shock for a garces restaurant the wine list is wonderful though .
i love this place so much yes it can be a bit expensive but its very much worth it i tried the elk burger this weekend and it was awesome the vegan milkshakes are also great seeing as im completely lactose intolerant .
dont waste your time .
best burgers in the us that is all .
another example of emperors new clothes dining trendy the place to be seen i found small portions overpriced noisy slow service the chinese takeout across the alley jin house is much better and much less pretentious .
great burgers amazing belgian french fries with dips crayons at tables to draw your next masterpiece the only negative is the price but you pay for quality .
im sorry but i wasnt impressed with the lackluster happy hour the macarons tasted stale or about 3 days old i think the real kicker was when they were busting out the franzia boxed wine im assuming that was for the sangria .
the first thing that struck me about this place wasnt the food but the amazing service i received from the minute i walked in the delicious food is the cherry on top .
seriously overpriced and overrated they call it pizza but really its flatbread 16 for one person and not that great scallop risotto was 24 for 3 scallops and about a 14 cup of risotto really four people and our bill was almost 200 just not worth it .
butter truffle burger yes please the only thing that would take it over the top is some duck paté i also get super down with the smashed onion burger add avocado bacon and bbq make sure to take a second and soak in the decor .
really dont get it lunch is ok but dinner menu is boring people must be caught up in the celebrity chef thing there are many much better restaurants in philly .
his place blew me away the burgers are nothing like ive ever had it was perfectly prepared we had an order of the fries and the bbq pork sandwich which were also very well balanced dishes anyone who takes food seriously should be visiting this place .
i heard people raving about this place why its not special and way to overpriced for its unspecialness .
one of the best burgers you will ever have also their green chili cheese fries are to die for .
10 corkage fee now that they have a liquor license whats the point of having such a great wine shop in the restaurant if youre going to charge a fee to patrons for using it ridiculous .
i always hit this place when i come into philly i love the butter truffle burger with chipotle fries if you love burgers try this spot its small and has a great vibe .
beware vegetarians garces pizza yes even their margherita pizza is brushed with duck fat thank goodness my husband mentioned to the waiter we were vegetarians otherwise we would have been clueless if youre a veggie dont waste your time .
best burgers in philly check out my full review here goodyummyeats wordpress … .
chaotic lunch scene with frequent errors including one making me wait almost half an hour for my sandwich chicken sandwich was nearly completely bread and vegetables with a tiny piece of chicken served with completely dry greens in a plastic cup substandard .
this place keeps my add butt busy sketching eating drinking i love this shop of burgerbliss .
overrated food whats all the fuss about i had chicken vegetable soup that had a thick layer of greasy oil on the top that i had to spoon off baked goods are very average .
sketch burger is going to be my downfall my boyfriend recently moved right next door to the joint and i am fearful we will be eating there more than at home the burgers are good the cyclops is definitely my favorite and the fries amazing and the milkshakes .
no salad with entrees which is weird got the pesto today and nothing just stale bread peston was creamy and not tasty and they dont care behind the counter pump em out and get em out things that are 86ed are not told to you until you order .
are you kidding me punch yourself in the mouth and go get one of these also try the fries with the aioli hands down best burger i have had in the city i will be back saturday .
over rated over priced food was so so parmesan sandwich was sprinkled with a bit of parmesan almost nothing they advertise complimentary mimosa which they dont serve disappointing .
omnivore heaven .
cute place but found hair in my salad so needless to say i wont be returning back there anytime soon .
best city burgers and fries .
i had the lasangna which was dry and balnd the place has a nice ambience but food was bad .
fantastic in all ways the service is exceptionally nice and pleasant the smashed onion burger was great same for the fries and dipping sauce love the down home feel to the place cant wait to go back and try the shakes .
this place was so cramped and the decoration was sub par i could hardly enjoy the food because we were placed in the back where the door was slightly ajar letting in a cold breeze i would not come back .
color while you wait make origami delicious and veggie friendly options try to save room for dessert .
worst experience ever for 1 5 hours nobody had any food in the back room the waiter was running around with empty hands a table left after waiting for 1 hour with nothing on the table they need more waiters and cooks .
caribbean green bbq and tahini sauces are vegan sweet potato fries are great and they have vegan desserts available when in fishtown this is a nice goto .
not a fan the employees are wonderful however the food was fair at best .
huge burgers awesome homemade fries sauces and atmosphere .
paninis served only at lunch are way overpriced and small dinner is boring think pasta but at least its a byob .
best burgers and the pulled pork is amazing .
worst meal i have ever eaten in philadelphia i got a pork panini with mozarella the pork was chewy grizzly and flavorless the mozarella was also pretty much flavorless and the entire thing was basically the greasiest thing you could put together .
my new favorite place to eat in philadelphia everything is tasty the cheese fries are my favorite i really enjoy the variety of toppings and homemade sauces you can choose from to add to your burger .
jacked up the prices with a new menu and didnt bother to remove old menu from the window no class .
delicious had the seitan special and it was amazing the fries were fresh and savory with a yummy dipping sauce if you are feeling artistic while waiting there are crayons and paper for you to add your artistic vision to their wall .
omg keep walking can u say psychotic our server was nuts the chef was argumentative and refused to admit he gave us the wrong panini what a mistake wish we would have just kept walking .
huge burgers i got the truffle butter burger which was decadent no additional sauce needed and very messy to eat my friend got the kobe burger and we shared fries with the aioli sauce i was full for the rest of the day great burger spot cash only .
i ordered the gnocchi walfredo the gnocchi itself was great but the afredo was way too salty also they should let you still get the salad even with the takeout but they dont .
good gigantic burgers cooked perfectly .
it can be good or bad i guess it depend on what you order friendly staff ordered pad thai was ok but the seafood noodle soup was plain .
got the cyclops cooked as i ordered fries were great quirky waitress was fun too .
the noodles were decent good service only complaint was that on the menu it said 3 pieces of fried dumpling but only gave us 2 also the vegetables in the wonton noodles werent the ones shown in the menu pictures it was napa cabbage instead totally different .
if youre veg an get the seitan bbq sammich you wont be disappointed lots of seitan and lots of delicious sauce on a nice big roll has outdoor seating too which is a plus in the warmer weather writing this review made me hungry .
the bubble tea was awful it was like a milkshake and they just randomly charged more for it bc they said sorry the price just went up .
nice laidback little burger place lots of options for burgers and for toppings pretty impressive vegan burger although not outstanding fries are gooooooooooooood and you get so many i love ordering off a checklist and drawing .
dont try the mochi ice cream .
great burgers with lots of choices of toppings excellent fries two words truffle burger .
disgusting mochi ice cream that is not mochi and it shouldnt be in that wrap so unappetizing from start to finish cant believe they made an ice cream fanatic throw away ice cream halfeaten they seem very nice though ill come back and try the food sometime .
its a little overpriced but the best seitan sandwiches in the city are here and vegan milkshakes .
this is the worst service restaurant ive ever been to the owner is rude and incompetent i will never return to this place again .
sketch is a great find love the enthusiasm of the owner phyllis shes truly a foodie and it shows in every way you must try her homemade desserts as well as her great sandwiches and fries .
the sweet potato burrito has like seven sweet potatoes in each bite and its too much let the beans and rice come out and play tom theyre dying in sweet ps shadow .
best burgers not only in the city but on the entire planet earth .
dont know what yall talking about this place not good i was their when they first open the shop didnt even have a real menu food was over priced and their were real mexicans oh wait they couldnt have been because the food was terrible .
great food and atmosphere just a little pricey for extra toppings 1 each .
i liked it until i ordered takeout from here and a green bug crawled out from one of the rolls i called immediately and they said they would credit my card that never happened so now im yelping this nasty experience .
the turkey burgers are out of this world although it was a little cluttered the meal made up for it .
really good food service was not good at all had to ask at least 5 times for someone to find server never cleared old dishes and glasses from table too bad for such great food to be ruined by lousy service .
amazing i love sketch we eat there at least once a month totally addicted to the dr pepper pulled pork sandwich and green chili cheese fries the baked goods are out of this world too the coconut macaroons will change your life .
eventually the money for my lunch was refunded to my card however i am still so disgusted with their attempt to serve me spoiled food and cover it up that i am not upgrading my review .
the seitan sandwich i had tonight was really really good their seitan sandwiches have come a long way from when they first opened .
ill keep this simple and straight to the point 1 the variety of fish from sashimi for 1 is very limited 2 service is way too slow took about 40 mins to get my order 3 way too pretentious .
i love sketch best burgers in philly but try something else too everything is homemade and fresh like her soups dumplings seitan mac cheese desserts etc etc etc etc etc .
dont know how so many people like it here its like fake sushi i didnt feel there was an assortment of fresh selections so forget sashimi was it ok yes good stretching it its like the sushi you get for lunch not for dinner .
terrific bean burgers delightful atmosphere pleasant staff reasonably priced tasty menu we will definitely be returning in the near future .
so so nothing special .
amazing food wonderful people and i will visit again .
okay place to have sushi definitely over priced for the quality of the fish i probably wont come back here again still looking for a good sushi restaurant .
i wish i had a photo to upload omg my friend shined me onto this place its now on my 10 ten list of yummyness .
fat salmon is great except for the food as someone who actually likes good sushi i wish they spent half as much time working to get good fish as they do trying to make the place look trendy .
these burgers are delicious probably one of the best ive had in philly also the people who work here are really nice though the waitress we had was perhaps a tad overenthusiastic better than apathetic i suppose and crayons construction paper yes please .
closed great place to come if you feel like wasting money on a cab ride from university city come for the sushi and youll be sorely disappointed however if youre into butcher block paper covering the windows youre in luck .
my favorite burgers in philadelphia period place itself is kind of a dump but thats just the way i like it again best burgers in philly .
this place is closed windows papered over etc glad i walked across town not there were indications that they would reopen call before going to this place did they move fat salmon maybe .
cant wait to try everything they can cook loved the bison bacon burger with horseradish cheddar cheese and avocado put me in a euphoric food coma super friendly staff and cool atmosphere too .
tried the big tray chicken and felt like eating some leftover meat hand pull noodle was mushy and sticky will not come back .
the food is soooooo good and will leave you stuffed for days you gotta try the green chili cheese fries .
this place is really really bad the broth is not flavorful and the meat is so little would definitely not recommend would to brooklyn 18ave 72nd street for hand pulled noodles .
hands down one of the best burgers if not the best ive ever had definitely best in the city try not becoming a regular youre blood stream wont appreciate it .
this was a very disappointing experience the spicy chicken tray was all bones perhaps the necks of chicken the vegetable dumplings were gummy and took forever to arrive this was definitely not what i was expecting and do not recommend going there .
high quality burgers a bit expensive 10 dollarsperson but its worth it great vegetarian options .
first time there reviews must of been written by family and friends way overpriced for the portion that you get waited 20 minutes to get water one waitress for the whole restaurant definitely would not go back .
best burger ive had in phila hands down and an adorable little place oh and delicious milk shakes .
placed take out order over phone waited 40 minutes to pick the order up waited 30 minutes at taverna ouza before the food was ready yes no joke .
wow absolutely amazing their burgers were delicious and plentiful there must have been a full pound of meat in each burger their toppings are soooo good and sauces delicious i love the chipotle and wasabi would go back over and over again .
for appetizer i ordered the mussels with onions and bacon they were delicious and the serving was big the main couse was the paella not enough seafood and the rice was watery and hard undercooked the red sangria was ok ive had better .
tasty friendly cosy .
the drinks are okay they over pour too much which made my drinks too strong the service is hands down horrible .
i dont understand the bad reviews they make their own vegan burgers which is pretty awesome plus theyre creative with toppings and sides decor leaves a little to be desired but i can look past that for delicious food .
sucks i want my money back i used to like this place and now its gone downhill try jeffersons for fish .
daym im super excited i finally got to try this place top notch burgers and friendly service unique interior .
customer service was horrible and the food was just as bad i ordered a whiting fish sandwich it was greasy had no flavor and the bread was hard .
you guys never seize to amaze me great toppings fries are awesome the cheese for the fries could have been a little better but everything else was amazing i said the second money sign because of the amount of toppings one might want kobe burger was incredible .
ordered pho tai doesnt taste like vn pho and doesnt come with the usual vegetables wife is native vietnamese and judged the soup to be chinesestyled pho guess its alright if thats what you want but i didnt expect my pho to not taste like pho .
one of my all time favorite italian restaurants if your looking for a place for a christmas parties this is the place awesome food the penne vodka is my favorite and the calamari awesome .
terrible the waiter couldnt even understand english before we even ordered we asked for 2 glasses of ice water with a slice of lemon and the waiter didnt understand us he thought we wanted lemonade or something also they dont even have vermicelli .
love the place good service food and a great cosmopolitan .
the beef stew noodles is the best but i would never eat there the place is old n dirty .
great food nice atmosphere .
came here because we noticed they served cambodian noodle soup on their menu it was alright maybe because i had morning sickness the service was quick and most noodle dishes are only 5 .
its alright the food is pretty good i dont expect a buffet to be the bomb it just has to be decent i had salmon sesame chicken asparagus and spinach was good burp .
ghetto dirty angry tip nazi rude chinese restaurant .
the pizza was delicious and so tasty for a thin crust pizza its honestly great its a must try if you havent been here .
been there twice and they charged us wrong added one or 2 items in chinese be ware .
the food here is original and delicious the thin crust pizza is the best in north jersey the service is always outstanding and they always have great specials to pick from .
oh no itz no good now it is used to be my favorite but now the quality of food go down even the new branch is bad beware .
i just had my bridal shower here last week and it was great everyone raved about the food especially the pizza the were completely accommodating to everything we needed and the prices were very reasonable would definitely have my next party there .
yuk duck soup pic showed thick juicy slices of duck breast over steaming broth what came was a bowl of bones fat and grizzle beware .

we sat at the bar it was before happy hour maybe 2pm there wasnt many people here the service at the bar was mediocre at best this is the 3rd time and everytime it has been the same .
great food had a party here and the food was fantastic service was awesome and you couldnt beat the price will definitely go back to try more from their menu .
the place is so pretty but the food is not that great great selection of beers service was not that great either .
the best pizza and salads great entries too wonderful service great wine choices .
how underwhelming its under new ownership with a new name store bought croutons on the cesar salad with no sign of anchovie dressing as advertised a pasta dish claiming to have cherry tomatoes and none .
trust me try the bbq chicken pizza you wont be disappointed .
just not that great .
my family loves this restaurant they have the best thin crust pizza there appetizers and soup are excellent and there meals are awesome there drinks are a bit pricey so i stick to water and have great food .
this is a review of their delivery which i order at 859pm and at 1110pm im still waiting for my food very disappointing when i called at 1030pm they said it had left 15 minutes ago when i called at 11pm no one picked up horrible .
fantastic madetoorder sandwiches with a personal touch this is the place for fresh tasty food made with love .
it has a nice atmosphere but the food is inconsistent twice we ate there and every time we had to send it back they had to take the pancakes back they were hard and cold the saged sausage wad hard and salty .
been going here for as long as i can remember my grandparents also went here for an authentic old school italian deli go to benantis you wont be disappointed everything is fresh .
ajihei sucks stupid rules overpriced i hope everyone here burns in hell except the cute waiter w the nice bum .
words can not express how awesome this place is their cold cuts are fresh sauce is great and salad is my favorite highly recommend .
rude staff i came in to buy take out and staff looked at me like i was insane impolite chef behind counter left hungry i wont be back .
my mom introduced us to benantis back in the day fresh bread fresh mozz stacked sandwich i always got their salami sandwiches sooo good i moved to the west coast and once in awhile i do get cravings for this place go there you wont be disappointed .
a bit pricy in my taste was there to visit the university 20 minimum a person for a sushi only dinner the food was not bad but the wait time for food is quite long .
fresh mozzarella is so fresh and amazing b prepared to go early because the good food sells fast bread is always fresh and you can have a cup of coffee while waiting on line parking lot across the street which makes things easier .
the sushi was good but overpriced plus we felt like they were rushing us out of there tomo is a way better deal for similar quality plus they are friendlier .
i order all of our 36ft italian heros here and the mozz is delish fantastic .
sea food wasnt fresh will not go there again .
best for sauce and ravioli i wont purchase anywhere else charlie the owner is a great guy even though he speaks to me in italian sometimes i just go with it allows some nice banter going on ask for an italian combo and your life will be complete .
yuck besides being a basement sushi spot which is kinda gross the quality of fish is not great their tempura is awesome though hence the 2 stars .
great italian deli sandwiches period if you think youve had great jersey subs hoagies or whatever you call them this place rocks bring cash and a big appetite you will not be disappointed .
sushi itself is acceptable yet highly overpriced but service and ambiance are truly dreadful located in the basement with a limited seating waiting crowd stands right behind the people who eat an attitude of waiters points at their total lack of experience of work in the service sector .
wow what a sandwich it was soooo good freshly made and the olives and macaroni salad were excellent definitely a must try .
i had burntricesmelling biryani so did several others so stopped going there period .
this place is old school love it great sandwiches and breads best lunch ive had in bayonne .
was very authentic and good in the early days even their buffet had good chicken and mutton biriyani later on quality has decreased a lot recently it has become so tasteless nothing tastes good anymore here forget about the good biriyani way below the standards of good food .
this place has the best fresh mozzarella ever and super friendly when you make a order just wished they delivered i would get a sandwich every day .
dont wast your time with this place they charge 3 for a delivery fee and then on top of it have the nerve to call me asking for more money for the delivery guy i will be not be supporting this establishment .
the best italian sandwiches ive ever had great sauce too .
good concept correct food poor service and to wash your hands before your sandwich youre invited to go to chipotle around the corner .
whenever i crave a sandwich i go to benantis great little neighborhood italian deli call in advance and order or be prepared to wait long lines i have not found deli like this anywhere else ive lived .
wow this is some of the most disgusting vegan food ive ever had .
absolutely delicious boyfriend and i drive an hour away to go to pho 501 rather than 10 min down the street in our own town their broth is smooth well seasoned and perfect in every way possible boyfriend practically lives at 501 .
overrated tourist trap not worth the wait go farther into the east village to any of the other ramen places and its just as good without the ridiculous wait .
friendly staff with good pho the pho had great flavors and the aroma reaches to thw parking lot the summer rolls were fresh and yummy this will be my pho to go to place .
meh dont know what the big deal is on the good side nice decor fast service on the bad music too loud had their tonkotsu pork was thin and dry broth merely ok for 15 bucks not a great value .
best pho i have ever had hands down broth is flavorful and fresh tasting specialty soups served only wkends and you have to come early or else they run out well worth the trip to east hartford .
not even close to good there are so many ramen shops in nyc that are far better this place piles on the msg to fake flavor they cook the noodles pretty well and there are some dishes that are passable but the broth is lousy .
best noodle soup in the area cant go wrong with beef pho for 8 50 huge bowl of soup will keep you full for hours also a amazing hangover cure .
i didnt enjoy it the hype is not deserved .
authentic they have an extremely limited menu but all they need is their pho the broth is savory and has the perfect portion of spices almost as good as my moms i will definitely add this to the list when i come to ct .
i literally ate rotten tomatoes from this shit hole the hostess and staff sucked the food sucked everything was overpriced we waited forever for shit i will never go back i wish i had never gone in the first place .
short and to the point menu each and every time i visit hartford i cant wait to go back their noodle soup is always on point thank you pho501 .
over rated another dumb hipster fusion place .
awesome pho my first time visiting i was a bit wary because of the appearance they also dont have options each time i have come it has been packed .
for the lack of better words shitty ramen overpriced would never come back totto ramen is way better if i could give it no stars i would .
love their spring rolls wish they would offer their special weekend soup during the weekday unfortunately i have been able to make my way their to try the spicy one i hope to make it there sometime .
no addon policy is the dumbest thing ive heard of we had to lie about it to get a person an order who was right outside waitress gave us a hard time when food was on table and person has already arrived ramen was alright .
had pho in several places up and down the east coast none were better than this very bare bones place fast service great pho id highly recommend it i live 45 minutes away will be making trips to hartford just for pho .
fine overpriced and overhyped not the best pork bun ive ever had and the ramen in my opinion was utterly disappointing the noodles were either overworked or undercooked wouldnt come back also over priced .
this was my first pho restaurant and it converted me in a pho fan ive been several times since then and it remains one of my favorite restaurants in the hartford area .
completely overrated horrible service and mediocre food .
i absolutely love this place yes its a whole in the wall but the pho amazing and the ladies that work there are so nice and remember you when you come in yes the place is limited to only pho but honestly thats all you need .
just phoned westchester medical center dental dept a person identifying himself as rob proved to be impatient and not helpful however after rob sent me on a wild goose chase with the wrong information i did call back and losita was extremely helpful .
this place is mecca heavenly there pho is spot on place is fast paced and service is quick very affordable in and out in 30 mins or less closer until july 28 for vacation though .
ive been to this restaurant about 5x already and every time i go it just keeps getting worse every time i try to give it another chance i just end up disappointed the ramen is tasteless and overpriced there is always a long wait its definitely overrated .
great authentic vietnamese pho my family has been coming here for 22 years great food and staff definitely best pho in the area you will not be disappointed .
not worth the 2 hour wait was disappointed with the ramen nothing special noodles were meh and broth was lacking some flavor 2 stars for the pork buns though .
first time experiencing pho im so glad i did huge portions delicious a small is usually enough for me and i eat alot only thing is their menu is small but what they have is done right .
not hot enough .
bomb soup you know its good because no one speaks english straight off the boat pho food .
i dont understand the appeal the ramen is okkind of bland but its pretty hard to mess up ramen badly not true to the hype there are so many ramen restaurants in the area which are a bit cheaper shorter waits and more flavorful noodles .
great food great price the people and atmosphere are the best try it you will not be sorry .
not worth the 3 hr wait i had to endure on a friday night small mediocre ramen bowl that i could have made better at home with instant japanese noodles and vegetables actually benefits vibe to the restaurant and order comes within 20 mins of ordering .
cant beat the taste or price favorite lunch spot in the area huge portions of delicious pho ready in under 5 mins sign me up .
if you are from asia dont try ippudony literally taste worse than 日清拉麵 there are so many good japanese restaurant in manhattan even authentic one you can find but definitely not ippudony ramen here is more like normal noodle and the chashu is dry like woods so disappointed .
great pho great fast service great food field trip for my son .
i feel like this restaurant was overhyped and was not worth it in the end the ramen was decent and the wait times were way too long the pork buns were good however .
best pho i have found in the area the place is small and usually busy and sometimes you have to wait pho is delicious and well priced try sesame ball for desert .
just okay wouldnt rush back because the food isnt worth the wait .
for connecticut this place is pretty good sesame balls are delicious people are welcoming pho was pretty good not the best ive ever had but this place is still worth a visit good prices too get the sesame balls .
used to be good now a tourist spot where they will rush you to finish they give you the green tea and check while youre still eating there are plenty of other good ramen places in the area skip the hype and wait .
beef pho is delicious the beef was soft and juicy definitely will come back next time when im in the area .
ippudo ny is very difarent than ippudo in japan the service of the womens reception are not good they are impolite i like ippudo in japan but not ippudo ny .
we drove in from cleveland oh we headed right to pho 501 from the hotel outstanding food as good as any in oh or cali they do a few things plus do them very very well .
the worst management ever i really enjoy the ramen however the management and wait staff are terrible enough for me to get ramen from another place .
1st time that i are there had some doubts about this place seem small but with confusing on our order the food made up for it the pho was great .
reasonable good ramen but compared to other places in the city overrated and overpriced during peak hours long waiting times even though it is a rather large venue for ramen very loud .
best lunch place in hartford all about the food not the service lines at lunch high turnover fresh .
overrated overhyped food tiny portions expensive musthave addons that im surprised didnt come with the bowl of 15 ramen 26 after taxgratuity slightly undercooked ramen noodles literally just 10 seconds under ambiance crowded loud servers uncomfortable seats booth verdict nope never tricking me to coming back here again .
i love this place wish it was closer to my home i will come here for lunch whenever im in the area .
overrated and expensive .
great pho spot in east hartford happend to stumble upon it and it meets that the qualities of a good soup joint cheap tasty no frills will swing by again in the future .
overpriced overrated told us it was an hour wait ended up being 2 hours 15 minutes dont come .
cute quaint little gem of a place simple and uncomplicated as they only serve pho pho and more pho no ambiance but its charming in its own way definitely will go back very inexpensive soup base can be a bit more savory though .
waited about 40 minutes for a table which was to be expected the ramen and pork buns were delicious however i was very disappointed when i ended up curled up on the bathroom floor that evening with food poisoning keep it clean ippudo .
definitely a hole in the wall but good broth puts it to a 5 felt rushed to eat 230 in the afternoon when most other places are empty its place was packed parking was also packed but nothing beats hot soup on a rainy day .
i guess the food was good but i was up all night tossing and turning due to an msg overdose not that im accusing them of adding msg im sure they dont but i suppose the naturally occurring msg is just amplified by their cooking process .
basically the other reviewers have hit the nail on the head this place is a hole in the wall very simple but the food is amazing i prefer the meat and broth here over the ones at pho boston cant wait to go back .
seriously guys this place is not worth the hype or the wait noodles were too thin and broth was meh go to minca instead .
i have and will continue to drive 30 miles for the pho here there must be crack in it because i am addicted .
not impressed not worth the wait and ive definitely had better .
7 for take out beef pho it is a filled to the brim quart container with noodles sliced beef scallions and beef broth and a separate bag filled with mint bean sprouts and red sauce great broth it cures all ailments .
waited for 2 hours you need to add extra for soft boiled egg to make it spicy et al to make your ramen taste the way you want it daikokuya and ajisen in los angeles are still the best ramen ever .
really good soup their broth is surprisingly rich yes its a small place no its no fancy it gets crowded at lunch but in the end is got good soup .
fake ray ban sun glass web site raybanofficialraybanonl… a knock off ray ban web site based in where else china the web site looks official but the glasses are cheap knock offs fyi .
if you want pho and you are in east hartford dont hesitate to go here just be prepared to sit shoulder to shoulder with strangers and smell like beef when you walk out .
overpriced 31 for total does not seem be worthy as an 100 asian i think the taste of ramen is not even better than any other restaurants and wait for 50 mins which makes it worse .
two words inexpensive and good .
portion is not big enough .
not sure what they put in this stuff but im hooked i stop in for a large with shrimp and meat on the side one of my favorite meals anywhere this place gets busy during lunch so get there before 12 or after 1 .
why i cant take my food to go and when we order the food no people told us that so bad service we order toooooooo much food .
the best in ct pho and pho only and they do it well west hartford can have pho boston its totally overrated and overhyped .
customer service is horrible we were waiting inside and this dude told us get out what the heck .
awesome pho but the restraunt is so cramped especially during busy hours it gives u that new york dinning feeling when you are there cause you are so close to the next person but the best soup in town .
this place made me officially give up on ramen since this so called best ramen in america couldnt make me enjoy their ramen i dont think any other places would .
good pho cant complain about the food but the restraunt is sooo cramped especially during busy hours i feel as if im dining with the people at the table next to me but over all decent bowl of pho .
id love to love this place the food is awesome unfortunately the service is so snotty and the environment is so obnoxious that its really impossible to rate it any higher .
small cozy place food is simple fresh reliably tasty great place to be a regular at for any time bang for the buck just sit down and ask for medium beef if youre hungry ask for large .
if the noise level in the place werent so seriously off the charts the bowl of udon we had might have been a lot more memorable too bad we had been looking forward to eating there .
love this place extremely affordable and great service lovely ambiance as well most of the sandwiches i have tried are excellent the coronation chicken sandwich is especially good .
i went for the experience it was good did it done it a second time would just be sloppy 2nd it gets a one star because seriously it is ramens .
cool vibe good sandwiches and relatively inexpensive will be back .
why go you believe famous good you think long wait good you like the ippudo in japan why dont go you dont want to wait 45 mins for average food you dont like too much msg you like the ippudo in japan .
one stop shop for breakfast lunch and even small groceries good hangout and meeting spot as well very much so a gem well done .
lucky i went there at 5pm for dinner to beat the line food was ood but wasnt worth the price and wait after 5pm .
what a wonderful breakfast joint in greenpoint i am certainly coming back here again the ambience is laid back and chilled and the sandwiches are delicious and very well priced .
long long wait too salty for me .
all their sandwiches are delicious and they have a good amount of vegetarian options and good service always a plus .
not worth the wait a bit overpriced and overrated .
the sandwiches and breakfast sandwiches here are amazing and served on balthazar baguettes with many vegetarian and vegan options prices are very good and the service is super friendly so lucky to live close to this gem .
ive had better ramen in d c which is pathetic .
had a great iced coffee and breakfast sandwich today love the decor and music very chill vibe great spot to relax and hang with local neighborhood peeps will be going back soon for a rootbeer float .
tasted better japanese food elsewhere food is pricey and taste is average the wait line is also long almost like 1 5 hours for two people .
had breakfast here this morning the egg white sandwich on baguette was great but the cold brewed iced coffee not so much still the ambiance and friendly staff made this a place i will likely return to again and again as i recently moved to the hood .
nice service ok food horrible cocktails poor bartender disappointing desserts .
traveled all the way from kansas and this is the best coffee shop weve had since weve been here awesome atmosphere great coffee super nice employees had a delicious scone and chai latte yum check it out .
btw how many are you are japanese here that gave this place any more than 2 stars and how many of you have actually tasted real ramen in japan i am going to assume very few .
this is a neat coffeesandwich shop i happened to go here since my car was getting worked on nearby it is an odd name for a coffee shop but i loved it look forward to going back if i am ever in the area .
daikokuya is los angeles is the king of ramen this place doesnt even come close the broth is too rich and filled with spices watch ramen girl and youll understand .
lattes are great here and im obsessed with their homemade poptarts however they do take a while to make the coffee drinks so make sure you come here when youre not rushing .
not worth the hype the food is average presentation is nice but taste is lacking .
good coffee and muffins really nice atmosphere and super friendly staff .
1 good quality ramen exotic enough but not the best 2 overpriced 3 no reservation come and wait 4 no doggy bag finish it or waste it .
awesome place they got great salads and organic and freshlymade juice you can also buy really good beer here to take with you .
the ramen was not anything diff than other popular ramen places in nyc especially after waiting 2 hours .
great coffee bar making some really fab breakfast sandwiches very friendly counter help and always smiling prices are fair and reasonable great music playing in the background and of course free wi fi .
the pork buns are good however the ramen i ordered was quite lower than expected its name is special with sesame sauce and others in it omg avoid these special things as far as possible trust me btw its overpriced .
good coffee yummy breakfast sandwiches great music relaxed atmosphere so happy its down the street from me .
an hour wait overpriced 15 for a fing bowl of average ramen weve had much betterauthentic ramen for about 9 in other cities id avoid it and go over to williamsburg for pho total hype like momofuku .
this place is awesome we live right next door and we were so happy when etc finally opened everyone is super nice and the food is freshdelicious i love the coffee as well excellent addition to franklin and eagle street try the blt yum .
too salty too much oil and the wait is not worthwhile .
best iced mocha ever .
just review recipes and noticed they charged me 2 for no scallion really something not to include in what you originally offer in the dish you charged extra for it this is plain wrong .
great place great atmosphere great food and cappuccinos blt w avocado is delicious .
worst wait time and did not get properly seat after 2 hours wait food is subpar .
great food great service great coffee great atmosphere i loved the salmon goat cheese sandwich perfect addition to the neighborhood .
went to ippudo again this weekend and had the cod since im not a huge ramen fan delicious to share but avoid it as an entree because its very greasy cute atmosphere its good to book a day or two in advance for larger groups .
great addition to the neighborhood the owners are really friendly and they have reasonably priced and delicious sandwiches and coffee totally not pretentious and they always play good music very excited to have them in the hood .
this place is fucking closed at 245pm please change your times on your website came here at 245 and it was closed waste of my time .
i love this place its right around the corner from my apt and ive been there a handful of times and every time has been awesome great espressofood great service atmosphere rules its completely affordable what more could you ask for .
it was not worth the wait and price we just went to there to see what all the fuzz was about and waited for more than an hour on friday night and a simple noodle dish costs 15 with two thin slices of meat .
amaaaazin place yall great new greenpoint spot with friendly owners and ryan is the best barista in town .
probably the best ramen in at least 2000 miles ill never return at some point the indignities of poor service and interminable waits can destroy what was once one of my favorite restaurants .
great addition to the neighborhood with amazing coffee and super tasty sandwiches so nice to finally have something like this in this part of greenpoint we have been needing it for some time .
got here at 310 sign says theyre open till 330 rude hostess informed is that theyre closed .
aside from the staff and owner being extremely helpful and friendly etcs cappuccino and delicious selection of sandwiches keep me coming back for more .
not sure why its so popular the soup was pretty bitter the pork bun was ok .
friendly staff great food and they now have whole wheat bread fav lunch place downtown .
a solid two stars food overpriced and didnt taste good over 45mins to get a table .
great home cooked food every day i just had baked scrod florentine with sautéed mushrooms spinach with sherry laced ritz cracker crumb topped a fresh lemonthyme cream sauce served with vegetable rice pilaf it was fantastic some of the veggies used come from their garden .
horrible service awful hostess and very tight food is not that tasty no take out price is ridiculous never again .
the food is soooo delicious they have gluten free bread and the owners are great you can create a million different types of sandwiches and they are open for late night drunk eating a all around .
gotta say didnt like anything at all expensive rude staff sooo loud and ramen wasnt any good paying 1215 for a bowl of ramen with the portion was disappointing i dont see why people line up soo long for the place .
not bad good lunch spot reasonable prices fries are great tomato soup good grilled cheese good .
i really dont know what people love here the food doesnt taste good there is very little selection and its overpriced for what they serve .
great grilled cheese place a block from princetons library super nice owner great sandwiches great value .
too trendy and too creative regarding their menu i prefer the traditional ramen joints in japan simple menu ramen and gyoza ippudo didnt even have gyoza and all the fancy untraditional toppings were bad dry meats very disappointing especially the long wait .
the absolute best sandwiches on nassau street in princeton the dagwood is amazing great quality and big portions what a great addition to downtown princeton .
didnt even have a chance to eat here because the wait was so long and the hostess was pretty rude ippudo if youre reading this you need to get a betterfriendlier hostess because mean people like that turn customers off from coming back .
i eat here all the time on my lunch break and ive never had anything bad i absolutely love all of their food and an amazing wine selection service is always attentive and detailed as well .
its been over 6 months still turned off probably will never go back ever .
the service is fantastic decor is adorbzzz the bathrooms are clean i just had the most amazing short rib eggs benedict everyone at the table was very impressed with their food the flavor is there and the meats were cooked to perfection 5 star .
said to be the best ramen in new york some say the best in the universe if thats true then im derek jeter and last time i checked i wasnt dating minka kelly .
great food romantic ambiance friendly efficient but discreet service good size portions excellent house wine whats not to like .
maybe i have different taste bud than everyone else ramen was too salty portion too small and just wasnt that great i prefer setagaya .
aurora is authentic and very good loved the tagliatelle some good wines on the list as well the tables are as close to each other as they are in italy so i like to eat at the bar good prices and friendly service very enjoyable here .
the wait is ridiculously long and the staff are unapologetic about it when you are finally seated they rush you out waited two and a half hours to have a 20 minute meal the food is delicious but this place is not worth the aggravation never again .
great italien place everyone speak italian i try the special pasta for lunch and love it i hardly recommend this restaurant .
i dont get peoples infatuation with this place we had 2 bowls of decent ramen for 35 bucks decent ramen not bad ass ramen 35 bucks for decent ramen .
the entire menu is amazing 18 prefixe brunch how can it be love love love it .
no taste i went there 4 people none of us finish the food dont waste your time to come here .
i havent had a dish here i didnt like great service as well the buratto is a must as is the veal chop but you better be hungry .
not too good it is too expensive for ramen .
tried their potato gnocchi and it was the best ive ever had not a connoisseur or anything but it was really good small lowly lit restaurant nice atmosphere you can have a conversation over wine .
good ambience nice decor just not my type of ramen the broth was too fatty .
ive been here for brunch as well as dinner cute italian place in soho very good price is right and reasonable i really enjoyed the brunch .
if you are vegetarian or non pork eater dont bother to go all you will get is a plain noodle soup with two pieces of tofu skin and lots of scallion for 17 tax and tip included 2 stars is for good atmosphere and service .
love this place excellent customer service great food and drinks and so inviting atmosphere the food was great service was great not too pricey and comfortable atmosphere will definitely go back .
sorry not worth the 2 hour wait period the famous pork bun was just regular pork bun with mayo yea gee great idea we all know mayo makes things taste better the ramen had very little content and it tastes just like any other japanese ramen .
came here for lunch ordered the rice croquettes as an appetizer which were delicious had the paccheri alla norma which was recommended by everyone and pretty good a friend ordered the gnocci which was also great .
coming from la daikokuya shinsengumi this place did not seem like an authentic japanese ramen bar the ramen was the most expensive ive ever had it tasted mediocre the interior however is very modern and nice this place has the craziest wait as well .
loved this place the food was great service was great not too pricey and comfortable atmosphere will definitely go back .
we were waiting for seats in the fancy ippudo ramen noodle shop for almost two hours nothing is worth the wait .
i been there a couple of time excellent customer service from the hostess to the managers and the bartenders rich wines list and authentic italian food .
at ippudo its all about the line seats are kept empty to maintain it if that sounds like fun to you this is your place .
everything was delicious at aurora soho i couldnt complain about one item on the menu we ordered from the burrata prosciutto appetizer to the octopus fresh made pasta and salads it was a great meal and the service was impeccable id definitely recommend aurora for any occasion .
good egg noodle and the fake msg paste broth is good too the pork tastes really yummy but everything else on the menu is blah 45 minute wait minimum and 16 bucks for a bowl of instant noodle with spices fckin retarded .
just ate here again this year had to add one more star love this place staff very attentive food amazing and restaurant so quaint see you next year for our annual trek back to nyc .
this place is overrated and over priced the wait is terrible at night time the soup is very salty aside from the made on premise noodles this place is nothing to write home about .
great food traditional yet progressive great service ate during a busy lunch and felt like the only couple there great atmosphere classical and modern artsy rolled into one great location one block off canal and right in middle of high and low end shopping .
the foods great but the insanely long lines make this place impossible to enjoy maybe if the places loses its cool they start accepting reservations or they raise the prices by 20 so the waits are reasonable i could come back .
mouth watering scallops and a bottle of lambrusco to go with it yum .
ridiculous price for a little bit better than mediocre ramen i dont wanna pay for their fancy decor soup was good but noodle was soft tiny and very thin roast pork wouldnt go there with my own money .
5 of us went for dinner last night very friendly helpful staff service was great food was really good and no complaints from anyone on anything we had beet salad burrata and mixed friti three had different pasta dishes salmon special and the scallops all delish .
soba is not that good soup is bland and the atmo is cheesy pretty wood and decor waitstaff is not japanese and has no clue not a classy place .
good wine list with a few affordable options .
interesting my review was removed why it was the truth the public should know how unprofessional they are the counter help i read neg reviews would not be removed sopranos strong arming you .
i always sit at the bar and end up chatting to locals passing by the food and wine are excellent authentic provincial italian and the staff are always friendly a must do in new york .
we ordered the worst chicken sandwich in the history of the world here no toppings tough grilled chicken and soggy fries terrible on the plus side the bathroom was clean .
service and food were amazing the mediterranean sea bass and cauliflower appetizer are a must .
very expensive they have a lot of nerve charging exorbitant prices for a simple chicken meal avoid this place save money and go to a real restaurant youll spend much less .
excellent brunch fantastic service the restaurant is easy to missoverlook if you are walking by but it is very cute and well worth stopping in .
way to expensive for a fried chicken place 5 00 for 8 onion rings really two pieces of chicken order of onion rings and a drink came out to 15 00 i wont be going back kfc is better anyway .
apart from the courses being rather spacedout between each other the food was absolutely delicious and the service was friendly and attentive we definitely recommend it .
walked in and was very rudely greeted by an angry guy behind the counter owner is an absolute douchebag hates kids hates women hates himself dont waste your time or money at this dump .
excellent food and service sure it isnt as high end as many other places in new york but the quality of the food and service at this price point make it a great option .
for dinner super loud super crowded food is okay 1 star for brunch much more relaxed food is better they overcharged us by 15 but fixed once we inquired 3 stars .
really nice place with some good food helpful waiters in traditional italian style outfits .
would not go back or recommend dirty looking and the food is bland you can see into the kitchen from the door on ellsworth do you want your restaurant leaving their kitchen door wide open .
really tasty italian food reasonable prices and a great atmosphere .
i ordered stuff to go and the server gave me the wrong item also the prices are awfully high the food is good but the service isnt on the plus its looks lovely indoors its got a european vibe .
almond brioche french toast was incredible as was the duck confit hash service was great and the meal was a delight overall we will be returning for sure .
it seems consistent with reviews food is good service sucks .
tried their brunch and it was at par with their dinner menu delicious we especially enjoyed sitting outside despite the small cramped terrace and the proximity to the broome street traffic which wasnt too bad during the weekend afternoon will be returning for sure .
bland just aful .
italian accents doesnt even really require a reservation amazingly .
stopped in for a late lunch 7 for a greasy bowl of clam chowder 14 for fish and chipstwo pieces of bland fish that were smaller than a credit card service was fine but food was subpar and absurdly overpriced .
we love the weekend brunch menu very tasty and well prepared our favorites are the sausages mixed greens and the ragu pasta will definitely be back for more .
blech creativity does not equal quality by the time you finish your curry burrito youll be longing for chipotle the people who work there are friendly though .
good food for a great price brunch special with cocktail for 15 food was pretty great as was ambiance .
small portions and only decent taste not worth the money .
a coworker recommended this place and im glad he did trendy spot that doesnt scream pretentious with a warm atmosphere but most importantly deliciousness wasnt jammed packed on a friday night and had good service id definitely go back .
i didnt like the food and my service was poor .
really delicious italian food and a very good wine menu .
they have some good beers on tap but the food is your standard greasy bar food .
good stuff i never was disappointed portions size are good too i usually go for the special as the other dishes can take a little while to come .
while the food is good the service is not that great really the only bar to go to in the pennington area though .
great drink pasta with eggplant was great .
mezze platter was good everything else was just okay including the bread that came with the mezze platter service was mediocre all in all pretty much entirely mediocre the decor was lovely but that doesnt make up for everything else i dont think id come here again .
came here for late brunch on a sunday the guava drink duck hash were fantastic as was the service and atomsphere new favorite brunch spot will come again deliver a verdict on that .
the food tasted mediocre and the managerial staff were complete assholes its a shame because the waitresses and hostesses were so nice and helpful wont be coming back .
really enjoyed this place went with two girlfriends got a great bottle of chianti and i dont normally like chianti loved the tuna tartare and calamari for starters then had a great pasta with truffle oil and wonderfully cooked cod the staff was knowledgable polite and quick .
this place has the absolute worst service i have ever seen they gave our order away to other people and then made us wait 45 minutes before having the kitchen remake the order the managerowner could not have been ruder not worth it .
the food ambience and service are excellent the wine pour was a bit light but everything else was great .
very bad experience ordered chicken dish dish was dry manager said thats how it would come again if they re ordered and walked away left hungry shane staff and hors doeuvres were good .
beautiful wood interior delicious pasta penne with mozzarella and eggplant was especially good good service .
not the best ive had i had an appetizer of different dips and sauces with pita bread the pita bread was good warm and soft but the mixed platter itself was not impressive other places had more punch .
excellent brunch the prixe fix of 15 for brunch cocktail cant be beat .
worst and most rude serivce ever experienced in the country not sure if it was for food or not but we got sick couple of hours after eating here .
the mushroom risotto is literally some of the best ive ever tasted didnt go wrong with the eggplant pasta either its a small restaurant with a nice vibe not too pretentious and i highly recommend it for a small group or date .
overhyped is one word for this restaurant usually a long wait to get in not sure it is worth the wait you could go much better elsewhere also the service was below par i would say refrain and stay away from the hype .
good place for brunch and the bellinis are perfectly made .
inhospitable service rude on the phone and at the door .
standard brunch location for friends in town 15 for dish and a flavored mimosa try the guava mimosa they seem to run out quickly havent been disappointed with anything on the menu from the duck confit italian ham fontina frittata applewood thick cut bacon or the benedict .
very obnoxious my waitress had 3 tables and i honestly felt like she was bullying our table into leaving all she had to do was tell us she was leaving and we would have moved to top it off she sat at the bar afterwards service fail .
great bread smoked salmon and cappelacci cozy setting and near shopping i want to go back for brunch .
yuck bad low quality food to match their shitty service dont waste your time eggplant with tomatoes were good though unfortunately i had a bad tummyache shortly after my visit pass .
tuscany meets ny in this soho italian restaurant really nice ambiance and food its really good to go with groups and start with one of their cocktails at the bar the food is really fresh and tasty aurora in williamsburg is also great with an amazing outdoor patio .
this restaurant came highly recommended by a friend but i found it underwhelming with minimal vegetarian options decor is nice traditional but also underwhelming there is plenty of seating as its 2 stories .
its too pretentious for me but if youre into it go for it good wine sexy decor .
the service stinks the rudest people ive ever encountered i ordered 3 entrees for 50 and was given one bread when questioned they said thats policy one bread per order how tacky .
i love french toast here so good service was a little bit slow but a girl was super nice and good smile .
very disappointed while the sausage and potato meze was not bad the seafood casserole entree was terrible it was full of thick tomato goop and had a thick layer of cheese on top how am i supposed to eat that it lined my stomach like pepto bismol .
killer brioche french toast i dont even have a particular fondness for it but do now and the sexy hostess .
i feel that the hostesses at beyoglu are the nastiest women in nyc i actually love beyoglus food and atmosphere but my large group of friends refuse to go there as they treat you with no grace or consideration .
laid back service no wait during lunch totally wellprepared food .
it use to be a nice neighborhood place but with success has come complacence and arrogance i think the quality has dropped and the service is atrocious save your money you can surely do better than it .
great real italian food .
place is okay everything we ordered was salty they added spam to our fried rice as the meat wtf yuck makes filipino food seem nasty next .
great food good service overall top notch .
when i saw the trendy halo halo all over insta i was so excited this halo halo tastes like milk and cereal it was disgusting 10 too much for this bland milky nothing tasting dessert they litterally just get rich off throwing left overs in milk horrendous n .
they have great pasta taste is not that far from the 5 star restaurants but price is more affordable and more friendly atmosphere .
paid 140 for just for just 4 kinds of meal the server was terrible as well as the owner its not the authentic filipino food if youre a filipino dont waste your time here theyre just paying attention their foreign guest over priced cheap tasting food .
i happened upon aurora soho by accident and im so glad i did i was surprised at how inexpensive it was and yet the food was fantastic everyone there were 6 of us was really happy with their meal and the wine list was great .
filipino restaurant short staffed i have been waiting for 40 minutes for bicol express lunch special food here is pretty good but i have to give two stars for their very slow service .
really yummy organic eggs very nice decor inside and the food was very delicious their homemade sausages are a definite to try i also had the beet salad which albeit was small but still very good .
this is the worst filipino restaurant ive ever been to waste of time and money i drove all the way from queens thinking i would taste a real authentic filipino cuisine but what a big disappointment .
rustic and charming the atmosphere service and food shouldnt disappoint anyone its one of those restaurants that i return to and comfortably recommend to almost anyone .
overpriced too crowded and trendy plays american music on loudspeakers its just like maharlika cash only no credit cardsunacceptable .
delicious delicious food nice ambiance if you can tolerate the crowd though i prefer the williamsburg location with garden this is one of my favorite restaurants .
neat concept and decor although the front makes it look like it may or may not even be operating as a business decent brunch burger soso mixed soda drink i think it was called the makati something i wouldnt go out of my way to come here .
good food and excellent wines .
overpriced small sandwich a 5 year old could make for 67 sodas 2 25 not even worth it place is small and was super disorganized the male cashier was slow very possible under the influence never again .
any place that serves a pork chop with stuff that oozes out of the middle is thumbs up by me kind of a random block in soho i hope they got a good deal on their lease .
decent sandwiches but cost 2 per sandwich too much .
brunos has the best pizza ive found in the ironbound so far its good pizza and unlike the other reviewer i thought their sauce was great service is quick and courteous .
ordered three plates last night a chicken wrap penne ala vodka and chicken francese my two roommates and i all got food poisoning this will be the last time we offer from here this restaurant needs to be more responsible when handling food .
i love this place tacos are so amazing small enough to enjoy a few of them the guacamole and salsas are so yummy the margaritas are amazing too i love this place sometimes it gets alittle crowded but its expected love this place .
only place in brooklyn i have been and not welcomed recommend no one to go food is so so .
last night i thought i was in the sahara desert in there it had to be 80 degrees with the heat blasting and a full bar drinks are small and expensive but guacamole is great dont get the chicken taco it is gross fish taco is good apparently .
not a great experience here sauce seemed out of a can and minimal processing of food large rough cut veggies as the two star description reads meh ive experienced better .
love this place atmosphere feels very trendy food is pretty good for the price doesnt beat the taco trucks at long warf in new haven but great place to meet friends for drinks and food .
my gawd doesnt anybody know what an everything pie is no its not a meatlovers pie and no its not a veggie pie its an everything pie sausage mushrooms peppers pepperoni and onions and yes sometimes with anchovies .
bar service was 5 star attentive and friendly bartenders food was good too good date night stop in the center .
miserable waitress resulted in crappy experience we need a better local hang with better service and better food fantastic new places opening all around grad hospital .
good environment with great vibe but the tacos was average some of the meat was too dry the customer service was excellent and fast .
they had some okay specials and the food looked alright its alittle out of the way for where i am located but otherwise the atmosphere is dingy and theres alot better places to spend your time .
great service on a busy saturday night try the oyster taco and the duck taco i did on our servers recommendation and they were awesome .
you have to wonder when the ahi tuna salad and the chicken chili are both so overseasoned what are they hiding .
this joint is fantastic great kids menu and good selection of meats for tacos prices arent too bad considering although the sodas were too high great fresh food .
okay beer selection but overpriced the food is okay bar food lots of buttonup and polo shirt types me ill stick to grace or pub kitchen also buttonupy or doobies or anywhere else .
great vibe in the middle west hartford the design of the restaurant maximizes the space well i love the hamper lights the caipirinha are slamming kudos to alexis the bartender the tacos selection is enticing and eclectic .
ok food and less than ok service sundays can be a bummer since the kitchen closes from 130p to 2p to switch from a brunch men to regular menu it is a bad move .
awesome atmosphere eric bartender and girlfriend very welcoming guacamole unbelievable definitely a must see .
every time i go im pretty underwhelmed with so many other options i just cant justify going back the staff is always pretty nonchalant and the food is about as interesting as the décor safe and typical .
i enjoyed every single food item and drink i tried we got street corn and fried plantains fried oyster tacos falafel tacos and some other various tacos the fresh squeezed margaritas were delicious nice scene and vibe and super diverse crowd .
i like the beer and atmosphere but i just cant get over the mediocre food its just not very good and its never good never ever not once has it been good did i mention the food isnt very good .
went there for the first time only got the tacos for lunch best taco was the chorizo and fish chicken was ok service is fast during sunday lunch will go back again to attempt other menu items .
2 5 hrs for entrées service is completely unacceptable one of my friends odered meat lasagna and was given cheese lasagna just another overrated montclair restaurant that should have not opened until they look up what timely service means .
this is a fun place with a really friendly staff food is excellent highly recommend the corn as an appetizer fish pork belly tacos are yummy spicy cucumber salad is also very goodrefreshing prices are very reasonable wonderful atmosphereoutdoor dining as well .
not sure this place is really open anymore everytime we try to head down for a weekday lunch the place is closed .
this place is great the tacos are the bomb and theyre margaritas are legit and i just moved here from tx there is also a hot waiter named mario sit in his section and you wont regret lol .
slow service one pregnant server handling 4 or 5 tables this spot was a little too trendy loud music and red strobe lights in a sake bar the bar doesnt normally server warm sake what sake bar doesnt serve warm sake food was poor to average nothing special .
amazing food selection great drinks and the service was outstanding great vibes all around the restaurant the atmosphere is very welcoming at the bar patio or inside def a good place for a first date to create some great memories .
terrible staff very rude poor attitude and inconsiderate absolutely avoid the restaurant spent 30 minutes waiting for a table when tables were available also even when there is no wait the staff actively asks people to leave once done with their meal truly a mismanaged restaurant .
excellent experience we went on a busy sunday it was mothers day and still received prompt and courteous service .
the ambiance was very neat and had a cool speakeasy feel but the indian food was mediocre at best i would come back for drinks but not for the food .
great place prices are very good tacos are pretty small they dont have the biggest selection of tacos but you can customize the order same with the sides and extras such as corn and plantains nice place to go with friends overall had a really fun experience .
the music is unnecessarily loud they really need to lower it .
very trendy and chic small tacos are perfect portion and tastey on weekends they have a dj at night and it turns into a lounge style bar fun to have dinner and stay for some dancing .
i have been to other bertucci that were great place to eat but not this one this is a sad place where we saw 45 families on saturday evening it was almost empty food was horrible greasy and cheesy even pizza was bad not coming back here .
nice unique atmosphere great place for group dinnersdrinks enjoyed their tacos and guacamole prices are on the higher end considering their portion sizes gluten free friendly with most options on the menu as gluten free .
service was okay food was very dry almost crunchy did not have any condiments asked for to complement the meal i would pick olive garden over this place i will not be coming back .
i had a great first experience at bartaco i started with an excellent margarita and sampled a variety of the tapas style tacos the pork belly is fantastic i look forward to trying different dishes next time .
find another pizza place way over priced for cheaply made pizza dominos is better compared to this place total disappointment and a waste of 18 .
margaritas not only is the music choice spot on the spice is perfect and the food is fresh i would like to have their fish tacos at least three times a week as long as the came with the cucumber salad get here .
rip off set 100 on fire grab a hotdog at the cart on the corner experience would be the same i am floored anyone rates this dump over two stars .
awesome music great atmosphere great food i like the rice bowels with sesame beef very reasonable prices pretty waitresses we ate indoors but they also have a great outdoor seating area they also have an app where you get points for free tacos .
very disappointed with the food first time here the service was excellent but sub par food expensive drinks and dated décor .
whenever im in the area i go to bartaco not to be missed casual fun and yum great place to catch up with my son who is in college nearby .
horrible horrible burgers i gave this place a second chance after having a really bad meal about a year ago bad decision my burger had a really strange constancy i sent it back the shrimp appetizer was in a pool of oil never again .
good as it gets in food and with live music sundays 58 pm got love this place .
ive had several experiences with their staff being rude particularly in the morning and im going to stop going .
this place is awesome its hip the waitstaff is helpful and everything on the menu is delicious its a bit pricey in terms of offering small plates but still possible to have a good meal for around 20 .
wait staff was terrific shame the food wasnt as good was there for lunch last saturday perhaps dinner is better best dish was cheese plate trout was perfectly cooked but bland pasta was just sad wine waiter recommended saved the afternoon beth w .
ive been to bartaco during lunch and dinner few times fish tacos are my favorite but we mostly go for the drinks which are always great djs are hit or miss .
was expecting better since its a meyers restaurant where do i begin the portions were tiny completely over priced and had no flavor this place is overrated and pretentious .
first time visit with family and we will come back boys ate 9 tacos hot sauces guac and desserts the chocolate tamale is the bomb and the specialty drinks were well crafted cant wait to we can sit outdoors .
stopped in for cocktails and a bite at the bar food was interesting and good cocktails were good service was below par borderline rude .
good food and great atmosphere .
lately disappointing long wait for food and entrees came out luke warm service was poor waited 10 min just to get a glass of wine .
one of my new fav spots i have been here 3 times since november and it has yet to disappoint cocktails are a bit pricy but delish cheap eats expensive drinks youve been warned always had friendly service .
breakfast they must get their bread and pastries from the supermarket thats what they taste and look like 5 cup of tea ha snippets of a gramercy park view which is nice and the hotel lobby is amusingly fancy .
good tacos good drinks good service will go back .
overall teeeny tiny portions appetizers best part though still small pastas small and unimpressive .
fast service when packed on a friday evening amazing tacos fresh and flavourful .
atmosphere is great food is good but expensive for what it is love the wine selection some not all of the bar staff are super friendly and helpful .
had terrific meal here in late fall 2014l will write the review closer to when we went next time but recall when we were there thinking it was one of the best meals weve had in nj great food great service .
its just ok quality of service has definitely deteriorated over the next couple of years i feel sorry for them when cheesecake factory moves in next door in the mall .
place is amazing make sure to try apps mains and dessert the portions are perfect for trying a full course meal warm friendly staff professional dining experience without the uppity ego just all around great place .
their food sucks my pizza was soggy and cold customer service is even worse so i wont be spending any more of my money here and you shouldnt either do yourself a favor your money is best spent elsewhere .
had an amazing meal there last week i also love the remodel .
if you want food thats soggy and not crisp they are the place to go the tuna wrap felt like it was dumped in a bucket of grease and the fries were soggy as ever didnt even eat them a waste of money .
my boyfriend and i went here on our first date the food was delicious and the service was excellent its also byob i cant wait to return .
since they opened portions are smaller amount sauces down to one prices up epic fail .
vday pre fix very byob it was delicious except the screaming we heard from the kitchen towards the end of the night the cook sounded pissssed about something kinda threw off our night prob will go again one day in our life but isnt a must .
underwhelmed small scoops of everything food was cold prices high not really sure what the hype is about iced tea was good .
so good that after a subpar living social dinner at another montclair restaurant we came back here only planned on the amazing zepolle and ended up eating the pork belly salad homemade parpedelle with duck and the zep as well never anything less than fantastic .
service is freaking sucks .
although it is primarily a restaurant i came here for a wedding celebration the food was excellent the gnocchi and crab cakes were some of the best i have ever had great ambiance good date spot i ended up parking around the block at 2hr worth it .
although we liked this place seriously my boyfriend had some sort of dead insect in his food whether it be a roach or a fly this is out last trip to this place .
nj monthly correctly picks this as the best italian restaurant in the state not cheapbut byo helps excellent food lovely decor top notch service interesting dishes need to reserve well in advance .
one of my worst experience have been a regular but seems each time the food and service quality is going down the basil tofu was very salty and masak chicken was not cooked properly .
best italian restaurant in montclair .
beef chow fun was alright sometimes too peppery other times not enough but had worst wonton soup ever wontons were mushy .
i really like this place its byob which is always a plus the service was really good the food was great the rack of lamb was excellent the risotta was pretty good i would definitely come back .
food tasted terrible bed i think chicken was old i couldnt eat it and i left i use to go there every month and before i never had such a bed experience but after last time im never will go back again .
i have eaten here now a dozen times and i still love the gnocchi ive had oysters here which were superb as well i highly recommend the shaved zucchini insalata and warm pistachio praline bread pudding it is cream in your pants amazing .
penang kicks banana leafs ass penang has better service better food better space air conditioning .
delicious i have been to fascino multiple times and have been very pleased each and every time definitely do the tasting .
thai basil noodles yum prawn mee soup yuck could not handle the taste of the broth roti canai good but the tiny bones weirded me out will not order again i would definitely return for the thai basil noodles cheap and delicious but would stick to just that .
we truly enjoyed fascino the food was excellent and the check was reasonable the zucchini flowers were delicious and the ricotta gnocchi were light and pillowy i will return again for a great italian meal another good byob in montclair .
virtually no vegetarian options even the sizzling tofu comes with pork and shrimp the sushi is not fresh either bummer .
love it been here many times never a bad meal love the change ups done to the menu .
the staff are rats and they dont have friendly mood also no squeeze policy and they hate latinos very racist and hope the owner reads this and do something about .
best place for a tasting menu both regular and vegetarian food is always wonderful and i enjoy the atmosphere .
have you ever gone to a restaurant and felt you were an inconvenience to the wait staff i think the number of hipster beards seems to be compensating for their lack of personality wundergroundmusic com75… dont sit on the bar .
had valentines day dinner here it was perfect pros creative menu homemade desserts byo cons expensive favorites scallops molten center chocolate cake a must .
worst service i have ever experienced in ny i will never come back again the minute i came in it was over crowded despite my reservation also the pizza was mediocre this place basically ruined my birthday stay away .
best gnocchi i ever had the staff is warm and welcoming our waiter was a hoot i highly recommend it .
the pizza is ok rest of the food is way below the average especially the pasta but the atmosphere is nice will not come again .
great bringyourown .
wasnt a big fan of this place the pizza was mediocre the service was slow the place was loud meh .
were there already a few times this times dishes were somewhat less eclectic than before but still great i liked the venison most was perfectly medium rare a good match with the brussels sprouts on the potato mash and the barbaresco rabaja 2005 from giuseppe cortese .
i had there pie yesterday at grub street food festival not a good flour blend mozzarella was bland and sauce too sweet the pizza was like eating bland flatbread with jared tomato sauce not cool .
great service great food great atmosphere great place nice work all .
rigatoni was ridiculously salty service was mediocre .
great service food was excellent messed up our order originally so they comped our dessert and cofee great people .
skip the pasta get the thin crust pizza .
ive been to fascino twice and it was a great experience food quality was great and presentation was also really great i look forward to going back again .
the food tasted like it was carefully microwaved and they charged us extra when we requested creammilk for our coffee an eye for details these guys however very friendly service .
great food superb service everything you need for a good dinner i would recommend to make reservations before getting there otherwise you have to eat fast before the next party comes over food was great did i mentioned that before .
theeeee worst pizza ive ever had crap service to boot burnt crusty cracker mess machine i choked on pizza dust while attempting the eat this ridiculously expensive melba toast with spaghettios sauce on it now thats not italian .
my favorite coffee place in center city if the have the costa rica pour over it is superb the thadeus espresso is an excellent choice as well .
terrible dont waste your time its overpriced and their food is not good .
cheap prices great coffee awesome environment with lots of room what more could i ask to find on a cold day that deserves five stars in my book not looking for the worlds best coffee just a wonderful place to relax .
food is horrible here we ordered a variety of things on the menu and not 1 out of 6 things was good .
lovely new coffee shop with a bright atmosphere skilled and friendly staff and excellent coffee my hubby says the espresso is fantasticultimo quality i like the punchcard and keeping my mocha dollars in washington square west .
overrated good but doesnt deserve 4 5 stars food is too simple atmosphere is nice yet too crowded .
i love the atmosphere in this friendly coffee shop perfect for visiting with a friend and having a private conversation since the seats are not too close together plus they make a great cappucino .
nice place but they did not have the 2 things that we ordered from the menu at that time then what i had to get was just okay ill probably be back to edit my comment though .
great coffee nice place in a similar class of coffeecoffeeshops as counter culture elixr pts etc .
service decor are good sanitary conditions not acceptable no ac the 2 plates on display behind counter had ants crawling all over them it was so gross fruit flies n flies flying everywhere yuck will not go back .
the baristas are rad the coffee is fantastic the lattescappuccinos are not only delicious but also beautiful real people that are passionate about the entire process of bean to brew .
super cute decor if youre going for coffee im sure itll be awesome food is pretty poor most of it tastes like its been sitting out preassembled and reheated youre basically paying for the right to sit in a cute spot .
good coffee and service try it if not just move on the many other fab coffee shops around lattelife .
dem nuh cater to di ras livity fiyah burn dem .
came to give it another try staff is better today maybe they were all on there menses last time loved the 007 roll it was yummy a definite must try .
this place is supposed to be healthy but is just gross too oily deep fried and nowhere close to healthy .
the ayce is wonderful fish is fresh and appetizers freshly made the ambiance is wonderful compared to all the other ayce sushi places i have been too we will definitely be back .
i reached there 710 pm where they were closing please update work hours to save people time .
great sushi good service all you can eat only but good price considering .
i asked for no hummus and falafel instead i got a salad bowl full of it i just wanted greens and meat with tahini foods good just check your order before you leave .
boy do i love all you can eat sushi at this corner gem of a restaurant the sushi certainly shines with various types of sushi for all sushi enthusiast the best part is that the prices are not bad im defiantly looking forward to coming back here .
my falafel was just ok had way better before also it was soggy not crisp if you want amazing falafel go to taim .
my sister and i are obsessed with this place this is our goto place for sushi the food is great and the staff is awesome .
this is a cafe just fyi they didnt have half the things on their menu staff wasnt so friendly def not going back .
have been back a few times in the last month and a half the spicy tuna has improved and the rainbow roll is tasty my preference is to add spicy mayo to give it a little more kick but thats me .
god awful minimal portions for an exorbitant amount of money service is terrible waited 30 minutes for an order with barely anyone else at the location the falafel was bland and the chili was lukewarm also a can of soda is 1 50 .
awesome so many choices and not badly executed i must say come hungry leave very full and satisfied .
place is a total rip off you get pieces of falafel plus a cup of vegetables for 11 .
great selection of hot appetizers and decent quality sushi definitely come here with an appetite but if youre looking for higher quality sushi look elsewhere overall a good deal for what you pay .
these morons have a buy one get one promo but when you order it they insult you on the receipt this picture look photos courtesy of eater com .
awesome the food was outstanding the price is reasonable the decor is very modern the service was great i went for the first time last week and cant wait to go back .
these people are morons they always forgot 1 or 2 things in the order every time total idiots .
excellent better than most buffet can order exotic rolls good service fresh sushi .
theres not a single vegan dish here lousy for a supposed cultural pioneer i dont even go to ps1 anymore because theres nothing for me to eat there .
small looking place with big potential ala carte all you can eat sushi reasonable prices you can order all you want for one price and eat everything any leftovers you take you pay for addiitional good value if you plan it right .
underwhelmed by menu offered had the most expensive pasta dish since moving to nyc this year not much to say about it other than typical overpriced restaurant because its inside a museum .
youll love it kinda like mr sushi locally here you check off what you want as much as you want hotcold apps soups katsus teriyaki sushi sashimi special rolls desserts awesome and not depressing fast service salads started coming out one minute after we ordered do it up .
cute with the classroom dining replica but i thought the brunch menu was really lacking and skimpy and my cup of earl grey tea was tiny 3 menu needs to be better .
my brother brought home and shared a pizza with extra cheese and pepperoni omg so good and such fresh basil so im eternally loyal to brooklyn grimaldis but im here in new haven now so i will definitely be back for more .
food is good but portions very small left hungry tried to rush us out would not take appetizer order until we placed order for main dishes better change name if it means yiddish mother as no yiddish mom makes small portions and rushes you when eating .
now this is great pizza got the prosciutto di parma and it was most definitely satisfactory isnt quite like the one under the brooklyn bridge but is definitely close .
been here for brunch shashuska with eggs overcooked and very small plates for the prices service was bad too .
the best pizza in new havenperiod go check it out for yourself the service prices are a little out there but if you just taste the exquisiteness of their simple white pizza youll be sold too pepes modern just cant compare .
this place has a cute vibe people are nice but the food is a little bland and in my opinion a little overpriced for the quality .
yummmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm the rosemary chicken wings could cure polio the pizza is definitely worth the trip and the tomato sauce had the perfect amount of sweetness for stamford folks this is an absolute gem and i highly highly highly recommend .
overpriced and overhyped good apps but the chicken dish was cooked so close to pink that i could barely eat it too busy in there to bother having them recook it bummer since we were excited to eat there .
drove up with my work colleagues from stamford and it was worth it fresh mozzarella and great tomatoes make this pizza different from traditional new haven spots bar area is cool to have a beer pizza and wings .
nothing was great too much sauce on everything really inventive interesting menu so it was a shame overpriced for what it was .
excited to have another alternative to all the new haven style pizza places in this area excellent crisp but airy crust and fresh mozz .
after the pickled vegetables that they bring out with the dry pita leave .
this is a great family pizzeria the menu is outstanding the atmosphere is fun and upbeat the bar is something you would find in nyc .
staff 15 ambience 35 food 15 cleanliness 25 would never go back .
first time ordering from thai essence chicken pad thai was delicious and my order was quickly made for pick up will be back for sure .
lackluster experience is it me or is it overdecorated reminds me of some old school mexican restaurants with all the stuff on the walls food was average didnt think it was anything special .
i had the chicken eggplant basil the best ive had compliment to the chef great service place is spotless food is great highly recommend to everyone .
decent food but between the awful service clueless staff and uncomfortable chairs the dining experience is far from pleasant do yourself a favor and get take out .
i really would recommend this place they have the best papaya salad the soft shell crab and tuna are really good dont forget to have choco souffle for dessert .
first time here and i dont think ill be back the servers are so careless that i wouldnt even give them a 0 tip if i didnt call them every time i needed something they would have totally forgotten that they had a customer in there .
we ate dinner here what a nice place service was very good food was very tasty certainly well come back here again i highly recommend this place .
it was over priced for chicken it is byob but the chicken was okay boston market chicken is much better .
simple yet elegant though the menu selection isnt as large as one might hope for the food is pretty tasty good food with a warm friendly staff .
banh mi french vietnamese food ergo french bread not the wonderbread they serve interesting place though but service is awful at lunch guy at the register is mentally out to lunch .
best thai food around nice romantic ambiance much bigger and nicer than spice in bloomfield lunch specials are less than 9 and take out is ready in 15 minutes the waitstaff is very nice and helpful definitely my favorite place in the area .
amir is one of the rudest and hatefull people everyone in bosnian community knows this but he is showing his two face to americans biggest jerk on the block serving pork and chicken there is no lamb in those .
my favorite thai place they know my name every time i walk in or order for pick up the aura is nice all employees are very nice sticky rice is the best .
no stars the food is horrid tried it a few times and every time it was bad the soup tastes like it should have a boot in it .
very nice ambience and good food the staff is friendly too its a little expensive but if you consider it that you are paying for a nice atmosphere it isnt too bad .
pizza is terrible i have not had it in a while but wow it got worse go elsewhere .
this is one of our goto places the food is consistent and good im always getting the spicy ginger curry and thai vegetarian rolls its a great place to go out with friends without breaking the bank .
place will be going down hill read my notes just lacks what it takes for customer needs in service and food totally lost in the way things function sorry but dont waste your time .
this is one of my favorite thai restaurants near my house food is always good its a byob i would suggest trying lunch because it is half the price .
awful awful decor awful food awful air conditioning skip this place entirely .
food is absolutely delicious i always feel good after i eat it which isnt the case with all thai places it has a cool atmosphere and the place is clean and inviting the staff is fairly freindly and the food is always delivered to you fast love it .
closed a couple of months ago handwritten sign on door said they were upgrading the kitchen but no one is working on it and the place is deserted .
came here for lunch service was spectacular and the food was delicious the restaurant is extremely well kept and the staff is very friendly exactly what i would want from a restaurant i plan on coming here several times in the future .
sushi quality is generic and ingredients are on the low end ambiance is ok but i do appreciate the linen table cloth for a sushi joint tea quality is poor plus they charge 1 dollar per cup which is outrageous .
great food came here for dinner and though it was empty we still had a great time one of the best places ive ever had shrimp vindaloo jumbo shrimp a new favorite spot in princeton .
cheap sushi but it tastes cheap meh .
good people good food bring your own booz im in .
i got chicken once and the same piece was white and gray there is no good chinese around here .
very good service naan were super soft and fluffy loved the harabhara kebab the kormas are flavorful and mild spiced .
very disappointed seafood was over battered and over cooked which took away from the flavor we both wished we hadnt eaten it just a waste of calories what happened this used to be one of our favorites .
service is phenomenal food is delicious and a steal they know their vegan stuff even made the daal makhani without dairy which ive been told by others is impossible ill be back with my family and friends for sure .
the food was absolutely adequate the service was dreadful my drink took 25 minutes and no accommodation was made which is questionable in this price range i assure you im not a particularly demanding consumer .
light was really dim could barely read the menu but food was incredible onion kulcha was the best ive ever had food was amazing .
the menu and drink list had me excited the food quality was subpar drinks just ok .
best indian food ive had in a long time the fish tikka kebab was everyones favorite so i want to recommend it but i dont think you can go wrong here everything was delicious .
atmoshphere is a bit outdated service somewhat slow kitchen overcooks food when the owner is away management not accommodating halfempty on nights you cant get tables elsewhere you can do so much better in montclair why settle .
i had lunch there last week and it was amazing the food and service were over the top it is the best indian restaurant around .
went here once wont make that mistake again .
this place was great for lunch because they were not too expensive and they gave great portions the fried vegetables they give complimentary were delicious my go to dish is usually the chicken korma which is a creamy sauce thats filled with flavor id come here again .
terrible went once terrible got the wrong food and it was gross went again food was gross again couldnt even eat it .
great food at a very reasonable price a highlight of traveling on business is finding someplace new an interesting to eat great flavors and colors .
very pathetic i have been there few times with my office group i hate this place waiters are awful they behave very rudely do not understand english at all or may be they pretend that way .
its good quality food tasty made it fresh excellent service nice ambience definitely willing go there again .
the teriyaki chicken is the best thing there everything else is soso .
excellent food very good service and ambiance what more can you ask for its byob .
the worst experience i ever had the boss was very rude when i asked why our dishes took so long and he acted like an asshole .
love cross culture so delicious and the waitstaff is so polite and on top of everything i need to branch out and try more dishes i keep getting my faves a little pricey though .
ive had better it was edible but i wasnt really enjoying my food here .
consistently great food every time the staff is very friendly also .
terrible food and over priced will not be coming back unless they change their sauces and reduce their prices .
i personally love indian food and this is hands down the best indian food ive had in princeton and possibly anywhere very well spiced to order pakoras are amazing and naan is todiefor the executive lunch menu is well worth it .
not happy 4 10 to add black olive slices from a can to a large pizza really and the pizza was just meh will be trying other places nearby this would be a last resort .
had lunch here and it surpassed expectations solid indian food the best ive had in princeton although thats maybe not saying much and remarkably easy on the wallet decor is modern and pleasant ill definitely be back in the princeton shopping center .
the good here is very nice the concern is some parties are sat incomplete and some not when addressed to the manager she rolled her eyes and didnt take the situation seriously without this incident i would rate 4 stars .
very good indian food for an awesoome price we tried the chicken tikka masala lamb curry and two other chicken and lamb dishes i cant remember the names the rice was perfectly cooked and the naan bread was excellent i would go back again for sure .
lovely spot but the food is at best average from the salad dressing to the duck to the chicken its just okay its too expensive for the quality of food sorry i really wanted to love the place .
terrific restaurant with a terrific lunch menuoptions slightly pricey considering the numerous indian restaurants in this area however the good taste nice ambience and friendly service more than make up for any cons love this place .
now this is wack the people who work are fighting with each other thats so bad you have customers here and the cook should not be talking to a women like that so wrong com .
the atmosphere is really nice is beautifully furnished decorated they are very vegetarian friendly with a well organized menu the food is very good prices are fair highly recommend oh its a byob .
very bad second experience it was that horrible i do not think i will ever be back everything about the dish for what it was to the taste to amount of time it took no good .
for lunch this is top of the line prices are wonderful and the quality is good and consistent service is very good too especially since at lunch you want to be inout in less than 1 hour for dinner the prices are a bit higher though .
eh more on the whatever side felt rushed even though the restaurant was pretty empty i think the staff could have been more attentive and the food was somewhat cold .
fantastic lunch we have been there several times on fridays wish the prices were more reasonable for dinner and take out we would come more often or take out maybe they could have a frequent eater discount or web specials for locals .
the food was good not excellent but our waiter was extraordinary rude he told us to hurry up and decide what we want because he had shit to do yes seriously .
i love this northern indian cuisine the potato flat bread was spectacular even turning one of my non believer friends to the indian cuisine light side the samosas are beyond belief delicious and the sauces that go with them make them perfect very good .
worst place for brunch in the city they literally start the stopwatch when you sit down then keep reminding you to leave do not go there ever .
great food .
overpriced ok food mmmm i tried because it hd good reviews so i went for brunch but for 2 people 100 without tip for brunch mmm sounds to me like i could had gone to a way better place for that money .
its a very rare thing to have a good vindaloo in new jersey thank goodness for cross culture which brings quality technique and flavors to north indian fare .
i hate these people they were rude and made us wait over an hour to sit even though we had a reservation just because i am getting deal doesnt mean i should be treated badly and the food sucked .
i knew brazilian food had to be more thank meat on a sword and a caparinha super amazing sit down traditional food this place is an amazing addition to the already superdiverse neighborhood .
slow service mediocre food plenty of other gastropubs in the city that do it better than this skip .
this is certainly one of my favorite spots the food service and staff are exceptional i have dined at malagueta about 4 times in the last year and they have never disappointed me in any which way .
maybe ok for drinks but their food is quite awful .
i love this small brazilian restaurant i cook brazilian food at home and this restaurant is great ive been to brazil many times this place is so authentic it feels like i am in brazil service is excellent highly recommended .
very reasonably priced but the food is really disappointing you get what you pay for i guess but i wont be back .
one of the hidden gems in astoria very good ambiance and delicious food for an affordable price we are definitely coming back for shrimp stew .
a terrible new york experience in every respect extremely rude waiter terrible food avoid this one and walk a few blocks to little italy and enjoy .
service is awesome very warm and nice and the ambiance is sweet and warm as well tuna steak is great and the shrimp stew is equally fantastic i can see this place being a regular for me .
extremely salty possibly to force you to buy beverages not edible also they only accept cash cant justify giving them any leniency .
nice and cozy place i went there with my friends to have lunch we had fried calamari and green salad for appetizers was very good i had sauteed duck it was very good too service is average for me .
absolute worst sub shop i have ever been to plenty of other places in the area to go to prices are high and the good quality is poor .
come early parking is tight .
highly dissappointed with the food we ordered three cheesesteaks two chicken and one beef and all were horrible the bread quality was very bad as well i would strongly advise people not to go here .
what an excellent restaurant picanha is one of my favorites everything i tried here is delicious not overpriced as other places and quality of food and service does not suffer i certainly recommend it to try .
what a disappointment for our first cheesesteak experience the one with provolone is extremely dry the beef is good quality though and portions are huge overall do not recommend .
small neighborhood brazilian restaurant went for mothers day regular menu five of us had 4 different main courses and each was delicious beef stew shrimp steak nice portions very good creme brûlée great find .
can you give less then one star i was only there twice and both times i got a tack thats right a tack in my food if you go chew carefully .
magnificent food the place is small and cozy and the food is absolutely fantastic .
they have a great location on the strip on south st and an average cheesesteak this is 3 am drunkie food so expect a huge line the cheesesteak itself was pretty dry and didnt have enough whiz break was good though .
took the wife for her birthday we were very pleased the wife being from brazil gives good two thumbs up she is a tough critic def will go back again .
tried this place today from word of mouth personally it wasnt that great cheesesteak wise i wouldnt recommend anyone to go here if youre looking for a good steak the good thing was it had plenty of seating .
i throughly enjoyed my mosqueca de camarao shrimp stew with palm oil onion peppers coconut oil cilantro over whit rice in addition my caipirnha was a great end to a wonderful birthday muito obrigado a malagueta .
been to every cheesesteak place on the top 10 list im no expert but tony luke still the best also tried the chicken cheesesteak not too bad .
food and drinks are delicious the exterior is no indicator of whats being served inside great brazilian restaurant in astoria .
i dont get it this place came highly recommended but i didnt see anything special about the steak as opposed to steaks ive gotten elsewhere their grape juice concoction is unimaginative their steak was mediocre meh .
i love this restaurant the food is excellent i love their coconut pudding the service is spectacular i come to this restaurant at least twice a month and i always leave fully satisfied .
chicken cheesesteak is junk weird discordant holier than thou cheesesteak guy .
impressive service food was amazing good ate acaraje corvina no vatapa e flan for sure i will return there .
this place must only be so highly rated because its on south street and their clientèle is mostly drunk the meats dry and the cheese bleh i dont get it .
sausage for appetizer shrimp strew and bbq pork with beans in a stew for our main macchiato and cappuccino for finish the chef came out to greet people one by one at the end of our meals great food coffee made right .
this place is overpriced and over rated i have had better cheese steaks from local pizza places in the northeast and the suburbs i am not saying that their food is bad it is fine just not worth the price you would pay compared to someplace less famous .
i can only think of one word to describe the food amazing each and every time that i have been here the food has been great and the service matches too .
please dont go here if youre passing through looking to try a taste of little italy food is extremely bland yes its cheap but for slightly more you could get waaaaaaay better italian do yourself a favor and go somewhere else .
i am a fan of this brazilian food wow its fresh and delicious and the service was amazing in the outside you wouldnt think its beautiful restaurant but inside the decor the food and those who work there are up to par .
the spaghetti was undercooked the tomato sauce was tasteless there were only two shrimps in the dish tho it was called seafood pasta .
might be a bit pricey but boy was it good went here for lunch and had a pasta dish which was remarkable decent drink selection too i will be going back .
most over rated restaurant ever if anybody knows good pizza theyll know this this is the opposite cheap ingredients why would they scrimp on good ingredients when they have such a famous reputation .
friendly and intimate atmosphere there was only one guy working the restaurant and he was very nice and patient the dishes we ordered were delicious we had the codorna and moqueca de camarao i will definitely go there next time i visit ny .
our thin crust pizza with sausage garlic had large fresh mozzarella pieces bits of garlic and bland tasteless sausage pieces the crust was disappointingly soggy on the bottom all the hype and wait for just below average pizza .
felt like we were at a friends house for a party everything was delicious look forward to coming back .
very slow service servers dont respond or treat u well will never ever come again its pathetic wait for pizza is almost 3 hrs in the restaurant .
vest restaurant ever i love this place .
im a pizza fanatic its all fresh and ingredients good just didnt have any flavor on the regular pie which is the only thing i am judging completely tasteless didnt stop me from eating 4 slices just didnt compare to lets say difaras .
wonderful all the way around great food and atmosphere sangria was really good not to be outdone by the calamari and sopa de mar the frango com prosciutto was the best i will be back soon .
i dont understand why people wait outside for this place there are dozens of places just as good and a whole lotta that are much better .
my favorite place and i eat out a lot ive been here for 2 valentines day consistently great food and they keep the prices low .
very overrated if you are from chicago you wont be impressed lots of hype and hassle for average pizza .
savory dishes decent ambiance try the feijoado completa on saturdays .
a half block line took more than an hour food was good but not worth the wait great location right off the brooklyn bridge walking path and next to a park on the river so a good spot for kids to hang out and wait and wait .
this neighborhood gem has authentic fresh dishes that absolutely make the trip to astoria worthwhile attentive friendly knowledgeable staff also make the experience enjoyable i wouldnt leave without trying the frango com prosciutto or the moqueca de camarão .
dont understand the fuss apart from buffalo mozzarella the overpriced pizza was average at best processed ham barely no mushrooms or olives both tasted shit anyway disgrace to italians learn how to make a pizza with fresh ingredients .
this place is highly recommended the food is great with a fair price staffs are also friendly .
maybe this place used to be good fooled me waiters couldnt care less about you calzones all ricotta long wait time cash only dont bother .
delicious food i have passion for heat and love the malagueta pepper i always get the yucca fries with calabreza and sauce for starters then i get the picanha with rice and beans and extra of the malagueta sauce definitely worth the trip enjoy yelpers .
horrible customer service was told the wait would be 30 mins but ended up being over an hour asked the waiter for more water and he never came back he never checked on us during the meal pizza is just pizza not worth the wait and service .
delicious food is amazing i had the moqueca de camarao shrimp stew and its like heaven i love it love it probably the best shrimp stew i ever had outside of brazil yes im a brazilian and i can say it was delicious .
absolutely pathetic an embarrassment to call this pizza in the proud borough of brooklyn lukewarm limp tasteless and the best yet expensive .
the food was delicious duck and mussels and mango salad all get a awards they had run out of cachaca this was a downer but hey its astoria decor could be improved but decor is not a priority at this price point would go again easy train access .
way over rated terrible pizza and lost liquor license we live in the area tourists come here without knowing anything front door people are so rude the original guys are next door way friendlier and better pizza wouldnt ever step in grimaldi again julianas is way better .
best steak place in neighborhood .
i did not eat there food but i have to say the person i spoke to on the phone was so rude and unpleasant i will defiantly not ever eat at there restaurants .
i loved the calamari stuffed mushrooms i had the shrimp stew which was great .
really this is the best nyc has to offer sbarro is better poor service and long wait too .
excellent spot with a fantastic saturday special feijoada completa beyond that consistently delicious with inviting atmosphere highly recommend it .
yikes this place gets worse year after year it used to be a place to take outoftowners to for real new york pizza now you have a better shot with the corner pizzeria .
delicious food bathroom lock on door knob didnt work when i opened the door a guy was sitting there and he was like ahhhh hope they fixed it make sure you lock bathroom using the metal hook at the door .
over rated we ordered a small pie that took 45 mins to make and was covered in so much grease the bread was soggy very disappointing pizza in the dc area is even better .
much to my surprise there is nothing malagueta cant make me like i thought my family butchered any love i can have for white fishes but good pollock what .
good pizza but service was no good you can get a decent slice at many other pizza places with better service .
it fed my soul we ordered the picanha moqueca de camarao and some fish dish it was all delicious then the desert flan chocolate mouse and the corn mouse yum yum and yum d will come here again and again .
overrated thats all .
amazing sangria was cheap delicious and plentiful acaraje black eyed pea fritter blew my mind quail was cooked to perfection etc i wish i could recreate it in my kitchen but i know that isnt possible so i will just go back again and again and again .
terrible terrible service we tried to catch the attention of a waiter and he just ignored us even if he wasnt our tables waiter he could have let us know he would send our waiter over instead of ignoring us .
a winner go here for anything .
ok im ready for the haters of this review i think this place is a tourist trap and theres better pizza out there in brooklyn thats all .
i had the opportunity to go with a brazilian friend so the orders were taken in portuguese i had no clue of what i was having i guess it was art of the game the food was fresh delicious authentic the service was efficient worth every penny .
over priced pizza not worth the wait better pizza in other places in brooklyn .
nice place to grab some tasty tapas before a basketball game at the barkleys center took my kids and they loved it .
let me start out by saying this was the worst pizza i every had the pizza was dry and had absolutely know flavor to top it off the services was horrible i would never go there again .
never been here for brunch just dinner but after dinner i must go back for brunch everything is fresh and delicious and completely worth the wait .
this place is only for tourists if you want real new york pizza you are better off grabbing a 1 slice than something from grimaldis .
olea has awesome happy hour specials my friend and i drank lots of cava and ordered their patatas bravas mushrooms and meatballs all were delicious and definitely recommendable .
this is the worst example of touristdriven terrible chain pizza ever experienced i would go to no less than five local pizzerias before setting foot in this overpriced lousy joint we laugh at the lines of people waiting to get in for their shot at mediocrity .
the amount of detail put into every dish is impeccable the food is just absolutely spectacular came here for a birthday and i just couldnt get enough of this place space is small and intimate the only caveat is the prices they were definitely pretty steep .
notwithstanding the quality of the pizza the host here is a vile creep who wouldnt stop patting my shoulder while asking if i needed anything and hovering beside me as i ate on my own at the bar gnc folks beware .
ive visited olea for an upscale filling healthy breakfast a few times and was not disappointed especially since they give out the best olea chocolates when youre done with your meal youll see celebs like malik yoba here .
exspensive and the wait is sick .
great atmosphere and decoration food and products quality are great service is ok could be a bit more friendly .
great for snacks and appetizers .
my new favorite place came here with friends and had one of the best brunches ever had the frico sandwich which was so delicious the ricotta appetizer is amazing i didnt love my white sangria it wasnt very flavorful but overall great food and service .
you really want to wait in line with a bunch of tourists and pay cash go for it .
im torn so good but portions were crazy small so we had 2 brunches .
sad to say but since they moved theyve changed .
really good food service and ambiance the ribeye steak was excellently cooked although the fries were a bit soggy the kale salad was skipable but the brussels sprouts were fabulous .
i really dont understand the hype this is a tourist trap and nothing more the pizza is okay but nothing special .
charming cafe in the midst of a residential street of brownstones ate brunch here which was a nice fusion of typical western european brunch and greek food pouched eggs were spot on .
been to grimaldis few years back this is a tourist trap in my opinion the qualify of pizza does not justify the wait time if anything id much prefer lombardis pizza in little italy .
best brunch spot on ft greene by far dont know why its taken me so long to come here i split the green eggs lamb spanish omelette .
overall unimpressed pizza crust edge was slightly burnt waited in line over 1 hr pizza was ok i wouldnt recommend far too many other places to try cannoli was very good not filled all the way thru .
i loved my lunch today i thought the lamb hash deserved a five star rating i enjoyed everything about it from the slow cooked lamb to the delicious sauces waiter was friendly and efficient bloody marys were extra tasty .
the place is very bad the stuff is rude and unprofessional the manager is helpless the place is dirty sanitation has to close this place .
great service delicious food if you like to taste a lot of different dishes share 34 small plates with a friend particularly like the keftedes lamb meatballs falafelcrusted artichokes and paella .
this pizza has tasteless sauce we couldnt put enough chili pepper and salt to make it taste good and still it didnt sorry west coast beats east coast .
always a pleasure eating at olea if its packed and you are 2 eat at the bar its really fun and the bartenders are always nice good folks .
tourist trap busted try out some other nyc pizzas every borough has something better to offer than this even in the specific subgenre of wood fired oven pizzas totally overrated save yourself the wait .
food 4 5 decor 4 5 ambiance 5 service 4 5 value 5 .
over rated pizza im born and raised in brooklyn and this is not the best customer service is rude and tablecloth is dirty if you want good pizza that you dont feel obligated to leave a tip for try anything else .
had their eggs local served with home fried potatoes bread raspberry jam and salad no complaints reasonable portions and price .
not impressed glad we tried it and definitely an experience but the pizza itself was just not that good the dough lacked flavor and the pizza lacked sauce and salt does not compare to difaras .
everything was amazing but the honey goat cheese croquettes and falafel crusted artichoke in particular stood out really unique flavors and great presentation big portions for a tapas place as well kind of a hike from anything but the g so plan accordingly .
grimaldis pizza is okay but given the reputation and the fact that people stand on line to go there i was expecting it to be a lot better .
lovely restaurant tucked away in the leafy area of fort greene homely vibe and ambience and amazing mix of greekmediterraneanmiddle eastern cuisine .
i recently visited the new location having been a fan when they were right next door the line for waiting still remains but sadly the old charm and fun is gone the new location is drab and the pizza was not as flavorful .
bohemian decor musty smelling could use a good cleaning but terrific food great combinations of flavors in small tasting portions we really loved the food .
there is much better pizza in brooklyn but if all the tourists want to wait in line and leave the other places free then im fine with that .
lamb meatballs in a spicy tomato sauce with whipped feta and mint this was meatball crack meatball nirvana hands down the tastiest balls ive ever had in my mouth id propose marriage to those balls if they came with legs lol .
i dont understand how this place got a reputation for good pizza i got suckered in did the 1 5 hr wait left so disappointed not worth your time or money stay clear i promise you wont regret it .
amazing happy hour and great food all the time i recommend the quince pitza the baconwrapped plums and the patatas bravas service has improved over the years .
you can do better that this place rudest staff .
super yummy food one of my favorite restaurants in brooklyn they have a terrific brunch the bloody marys are amazing the weight can be a while for a table at times but not to worry sitting at the bar is nice too .
more fad than quality pizza is good but one can taste the fuck the purchasers in it it is something that comes along with the legend .
great brunch spot always crowded turkish breakfast and oj is really incredible .
dont waste your time waiting on those long lines the other location in douglaston queens has less crowds .
got the polenta and eggs which was incredibly good decent prices and cute decor prepare to wait if you come for brunch but they provide stools to sit on outside and theyre actually honest about wait time which is refreshing .
pizza mediocre service sucks they just dont care not worth it .
solid food great local restaurant in ft green .
huge line cash only no slices the hell kind of business is this .
lived here for four years and olea by far my fav brunch spot turkish breakfast is so hard not to order and savory parmesean toast is amazing .
the manager treats clients like animals he made us wait in the rain outside and kept screaming at us to get in line and move we ended up leaving i have never been treated like this in a restauant this place is not worth going to .
super tasty greekturkishamericany fusion the coffee is meh though and our waiter never refilled our water glasses left feeling full without feeling stuffed .
tourist looking for nyc pizza this place has a grade pending on the health department i researched this rating and it is not good check these places before you eat people .
seated promptly back in november after we went to kings county distillery whew we were hungry somehow we ended up here we were seated right away probably right time place but we had a delectable meal drinks it was warm cozy yummy .
there is much better if you search in the nooks and crannies of nyc grimaldis is good but highly overrated .
one of my favorite restaurants a bk gem veggie friendly fantastic date place beautiful ambiance and solid service you need to try it .
if you want tasteless pizza this is the place for you really overrated crust was good but sauce had no flavor and prefer regular mozzarella as fresh mozzarella doesnt melt well .
great good and staff had brunch green eggs and lamb sausage i asked for a ramekin of their herbed yogurt sauce which rounded it out really well i would eat that meal every day .
checked this place out several years ago after hanging out at the park the food was ok but not worth the wait and the hype i guess its good for the guidebooks .
gotta get the roasted beet skordalia prices are okay but there are good happy hour specials during the week can get really annoying when people bring their kids because its a small space .
dont go here its not actual from brooklyn its just some tourist bs that belongs in times square support your actual local pizzeria its not 1 star only because its hard to mess up pizza .
without a doubt the best french toast ive had in new york and im a french toast person .
wait wasnt very long 5 minutes but to long for the quality of pizza wouldnt come here again sat upstairs which was crazy crowded the service was painful to deal with save your money to eat at papa johns or frozen pizza .
great food even better cocktails great ambience but of course the location supplements it though ive been here just for dinners olea is also a great place for brunch and lunch the service is great staff is friendly and courteous i will definitely be visiting again .
is it worth the wait i dont think so so much better yes its under the brooklyn bridge and all but so is the calexico taco truck save your time and go to its not rays much better sorry but true .
the half hour wait for brunch was definitely worth it great ambiance fresh delicious ingredients unique mediterranean menu friendly staff .
bland this pizza place would be amazing if you lived outside new york metro area big disappointment for the 45 wait .
love olea ive been many times for brunch a couple times for happy hour and had dinner too and it was always good the spanish pitza is amazing love the decor too .
first and last time the staff is unfriendly the pizza was bland hardly any sauce it didnt taste fresh the crust lacked flavor it was the texture of stale bread some other couple had completely burned crust literally covered in blackness maybe we were fortunate .
i love this place dinner or brunch everything is delicious thats all .
the new location is not the same we were very disappointed with the pizza the taste does not compare to the old grimaldis definitely no longer worth the wait .
great food mediocre cocktails .
this place is not worth the hype line the service sucks and the pizza isnt amazing its just normal ehhhhhh .
wow excellent place had the saturday lamb special 16 and a virgin fritzer lamb special was tasty and deeper than i expected like a deep dish pizza you underestimate it has a bar outside seating and tables inside service is very good .
delicious pizza though not the best ever worth the wait perhaps not the waiter was a bit short with us while ordering and rarely stopped by to refill water or grab another beverage .
absolutely amazing tzatziki was delicious lamb meatball sandwich and falafel covered artichoke heart sandwich were incredible everything came out hot and delicious its such a sweet neighborhood gem .
people are so rude who work here they said fu about 10 times to my friends and me pizza was horrible and tasteless like the people working there .
quite the tasty egg scramble medley with zucchini olives feta with nicely toasted bread jam the accompanying potatoes salad were average but all in all the eggs put it over the top come prepared to wait 2030 min for a larger group on a sunday morning .
very good pizza but tourist mentality rush you in and out waiters unfriendly staff you could find delicious pizza all over town this is new york city wont be back and p s i live a short walk away and an original new yorker .
a reliably delicious restaurant time after time great space great service great overall my only complaint as a fiveyear veteran please quit raising prices the tapas prices have doubled since 2010 .
i cant believe i waited in line for this place big tourist trap and i fell for it our pizza crust was burnt i dont understand how it has all these good reviews maybe the owners write them .
ive never had a bad meal here or anything but stellar service only strike against this place is that its a bit noisy .
i never got to try the old location and hence the old oven in my opinion i am a victim of the hype machine the pizza was average .
my favorite restaurant in brooklyn delicious food at great prices outrageous prices at happy hour brunch on weekends is scrumptious lovely wine and drink selections .
they treat you like they dont want you to be there and they dont care they just throw the pizza on the table and leave terrible service definitely not good for a date or a business meeting .
absolutely delicious tapas loved the patatas bravas plenty of options to be had as a vegetarian too which is always appreciated beautiful atmosphere with lots of cushions and even live music on a tuesday night and strong hot toddies .
terrible wait over 1 hour specifically asked for a well done pizza and received a raw undercooked pie dirty silverware and waiter who kept pushing cannoli dessert since it moved locations pizza hasnt tasted the same not recommended anymore such a disappointment .
i love every single item on their menu but i dream about those almond stuffed bacon wrapped dates unabashedly so .
long lines will keep you wondering if you should stay dont bother the pizza is not the best and not worth the wait unless you have nothing else to do and need a cheap bite .
i love their small plates and their drink selection the lamb meatballs are always a must as well as the cabbage salad and bacon wrapped dates this is such a cute restaurant nice service and an adorable bar great lunch time date place such a perfect restaurant .
grimaldis has a new location in a historic looking building at the corner given its fame this new location does it more justice .
me love olea its consistently great and has been over the 7 years i have been going there whether its the small plates risotto no longer on menuso sad pasta or pork chop its always good its definitely a neighborhood anchor and gem .
long wait outside long wait inside pizza average im sorry to say not worth it meh .
changed my mind i had an absolutely delicious dinner here with a really nice waitress im going again tonight if its as good as last time of course i wont be writing again .
this place is closed i walked over the bridge and was looking so forward to trying it out only to find the awning and a bunch of kitchen items laying in the space next to the restaurant .
whats not to love nice decor staff food the bar is great if a little cramped but if you want a great mediterranean dinner without any pretension come here affogato dessert is not to be missed .
quick service and turnover not impressed with the quality of pizza not worth the wait very loud music playing while you try to enjoy your pizza .
was an all around great meal .
completely over rated tourist spot burnt pizza shitty service so much better throughout ny .
yum just had an amazing parsnipgarbanzo soup w crazy good whole garlic cloves in it and artichoke falafel soo tasty .
not worth they hype the wait was long and the pizza turned out to be mediocre however i would try it again .
just go the tapas are amazing i also like the salads and the broccoli rabe pasta dish i never have room for desert so i cant comment on that .
atmosphere is fun service was really nice but the pizza eh pretty mediocre maybe because of all the hype i had expected something amazing and mindblowing what i experienced was decent pizza but nothing i would go out of my way to ever eat again .
i like this place mostly for brunchlunch great bloody marys yummy food nice vibe i have never been disappointed .
pizza wasnt hot crust was very chewy i wasnt impressed lucali is the best .
good sandwiches .
sassy mobrun service the place gets by on its great oven and good ingredients but any idiot can throw good ingredients in a great oven and have a pretty good pizza massively overrated .
from the oh so tasty almond stuffed bacon wrapped dates to the yummy spicy feta dip more everything me and my friends have eaten here has been great always a treat when i come to bklyn bonus acoustic guitar player last night too .
mostly hype not all that great for what could be a ridiculous wait ive had better all over nynj once was enough decent experience bit of tourist trap .
breakfast or any time this is the spot for great food in a relaxed and fun atmosphere i go here often everything is delicious but make sure to try the bloody mary which is perfectly spiced and i love the apps .
so not worth it waited over an hour for chewy flavorless pizza not to mentioned being squished in between another couple our local pizzaria is so much better never again .
tasty tapas and sangria whats not to like .
the line the loooooong wait the price not worth it i really dont know what the biggggg fuss is about this place and i dont know what ever make them think that i would like flavorlessbland chewy rubbery pizza tisk tisk .
one of my faves ever best happy hour in new york city .
very bad pizza does not worth the money and definitely not the standing in line .
its always a wait but its always worth it i could maybe live off of the orecchiette pasta dish and the space itself is so beautifully designed there is a sense of leaving brooklyn when you walk through the door .
after 30 dollars for a pie and 2 drinks i wish i would have gone to my regular pizzeria the service was great the place was immaculately clean but the pizza was not worth it at all .
really solid brunch spot these guys know how to cook scrambled eggs seriously you dont realize how much you get crappy eggs until you come here and have theirs super creamy and fluffy and their greek scramble was a perfect mix .
not worth the wait or the hype it was the most unremarkable pizza ive had at a pizza place edible but not enjoyable service was fine and the prices were not outrageous so 2 stars .
tasty brunch .
ok this pizzeria is just over rated there are a lot of better pizza in the city this is just nothing special the service was bad dont waste your time there are a lot of delicious pizza around w4 .
an awesome brunch includes full bar large well done meals for about 12 top notch coffee with many free refills attentive service comfy ambiance olea has aota and is my new favorite in the area .
di fara is much better .
one of my absolute favorite restaurants in brooklyn ive been many times for breakfastlunch and have never had a bad experience its the first place i take friends visiting from out of town the falafel crusted artichoke hearts are beyond delicious and the .
after waiting in line for about a hour and watching celebrities walk out i expected more what i got was less sorry but this pizza was tasteless and undercooked san diegos filippis in little italy by far makes this place a laugh .
the food at olea is varied and consistently tasty the wine and cocktail selection is excellent and the atmosphere is tops salads are especially delicious not to be missed .
this place is terrible a complete tourist trap with incredibly rude staff owners and a massive wait .
despite the busy nature of saturday afternoon brunch this place doesnt stop delivering high quality delicious food a beautiful cozy atmosphere and really pleasant waitstaff who keep us caffeinated and happy its well worth the wait and has become my new weekend spot .
overrated overpriced half of my pizza was burnt at the bottom the other half was delicious .
great food and service had a great time with my girlfriends on saturday night i love the pork chop dinner .
not as good as everyone is saying good yes but not wow and certainly not worth the wait in line and travel time it took to get there .
i like taking my friends and family here great atmosphere and convenient to where i stay when i visit brooklyn once or twice a year the food is like 4 stars .
not worth the wait the pizza was good but 2 hours in the hot sun never again .
one of my favorite local spot for lunch amazing leg of lamb sandwich often sold out though .
horrid customer service if you want takeout theyll ignore you like the plague the man out front pretty much cherrypicks customers out of the line with complete disregard for how long people have waited as for the pizza mediocre .
this is one of if not the best brunch i have had in brooklyn from the service to the atmosphere to the ridiculously delicious bloody mary to the meal no need to say more go here immediately and then hit up the brooklyn flea afterwards .
yuck .
amazing brunch .
there are a lot of good things about grimaldis but pizza is not one of them the walk over the bridge the view the pics of famous peeps on the walls these are cool the service the horrendous lines the cramped quarters the mediocre pizza these suck .
olea is a great neighborhood spot with an interesting menu and great happy hour tapas i find many of their main dishes to be oversalted so i tend toward the small plates every time regardless .
my friend will kill me but im sorry to say the sauce killed it good crust good mozzarella bad sauce definitely not worth the wait and way overrated sorry friend .
my favorite restaurant in the hood delicious tapas platters and brunch service is good and cool chill ambiance can get crowded .
seriously overrated overpriced this place is a tourist trap the pizza was unremarkable ive had grilled cheese sandwiches with tomatoes that impressed me more save yourself the trip the time waiting in line and the disappointment .
great for brunch turkish breakfast is an absolute must the service was great but the speed leaves a little to be desired which is really more a product of the sheer number of people waiting to ingest their goods than the attentiveness of the staff .
guys do not waste your time standing in line for this pizza is ordinary service is atrocious people are rude and it is exorbidantly pricey do not validate bad food and worse behavior spend your hard earned money on something to be proud of .
yummy salad goat cheese croquettes ricotta bake hanger steak and my friend said the branzino was delicious every course we had we thoroughly enjoyed .
leave it to the tourists i would never wait one hour in line for this pizza .
this place is a goddamn joy and thats all im going to say about it .
i wasnt blown away ive eatin at better places i would have hoped to have had a way better tasting pizza after that long wait but it wasnt i did enjoy the decor and the welcoming feeling .
olea has very good food and service drinks are strong it is very small but its cozy and very welcoming .
the ridiculous wait pushed this place down to 2 stars for me its not like any of the pizzas tasted bad but it was nothing special nothing memorable except the wait are new yorkers just seriously deprived or something you guys need to come to california .
awesome brunch spot really delicious food with clean flavors one of my favorite restaurants in the area and one of those restaurants i wish i could have taken with me when i moved .
the pizza is mediocre and the doorman is a huge douche he tries to get you out in 45 minutes this place is all hype as evidenced by the number of tourists caveat emptor .
best restaurant in fort greene .
this is just average pizza the most enjoyable part of this experience is walking across the bridge take off a star for the hellish wait .
the brunch here is fantastic it is really crowded on saturdays when the brooklyn flea is in town so go on sundays the turkish breakfast dish is my main stay sunday brunch seasoned scrambled eggs pita bread all kinds of delicious mediterranean sides .
o noez two stars grimaldis gasp all you want it was a big disappointment after waiting 45 minutes in line sure they use fresh ingredients but 15 is much too expensive for a rather bland pie that i could easily eat all by myself .
best brunch in ft greene dinners are very good too .
the atmosphere is nice and the service pleasant enough but my cappuccino was a latte and a mediocre one at that im not planning on going back there .
small intimate dining area with a homey and inviting feeling food was fantastic from the tapas to the entrees nothing was overly filling or seasoned .
terrible coffee i had the red eye which tasted like burnt charcoal my wife describes her raspberry mocha vanilla hot latte as undrinkably sweet nice service though .
olea has the best brunches in the neighborhood as well as the best bartender thomas i wanted a hot mulled wine the other night which is not on the menu and he magically concocted the best drink from heated sangria wine and other goodness love .
coffee is not bad and the spot is convenient but the food is terrible and service is meh at best good stop for a quick coffee break but not more than that .
great for brunch although the wait was painful turkish breakfast was delicious portions were perfect also recommended the awardwinning bloody mary with raisin puree .
you will leave hungry not drunk and broke i would recommend just getting oysters and move on to a real meal goodness forbid if you are 122lb and over .
no longer byo on tuesday but still an excellent restaurant .
came very far to try discount lobster roll they say they dont have lobster roll do not advertise if you cannot have .
visited twice once for brunch and then for lunch in a 1 week period this is a great spot local character relaxed and some killer lamb sandwiches green eggs and merquez sausage with pleasantly attentive service and appropriate liquid options .
unremarkably bland oysters the clam bake for two was disappointingly flavorless 90 and im still hungry we are leaving this place highly disappointed by our referral i dont understand the positive reviews about this place even at 1 a shuck i was ready for some real seafood .
been here twice the tapas dish bacon wrapped dates is awesome must get selection of wines are nice too beautiful atmosphere great service cannot say anything bad about this place even saw the other tables ordering chicken fingers for their kids .
we like the casual atmosphere and the friendliness of the wait staff and the affordable prices however the service was terribly slow and we had to ask repeatedly for simple things like water and utensils the food was not good .
delicious food cozy comfortable space a killer selection of drinks had the bacon wrapped dates so so good drooling now thinking of them and this place seriously had one of the most pleasant restaurant bathrooms ive ever been in .
i used to eat there a lot as a student i returned to find the food very very poor and far from fresh many of the lunch specials were just heaped from a serving tray much of the food was difficult to eat .
a charming place on a beautiful fort greene corner food is consistently good you can order two size meals off of most of their entree menu i usually go for the appetizer size and then order some tapas or a salad its really a fun place .
i just had dinner there tonight sorry but i dont understand the 4 star reviews .
had a lovely brunch here before hitting the brooklyn flea on saturday almost came back for the 12 price wine happy hour will be back to try the other menus .
have no idea ab this place the food just sucks not as good as the reviews showed cant undersstand how came the 2 seafood curries which is 9 75 respectively including only 2 little shrimp n some carrots slides in it i mean please do ur business .
fish was the tastiest ive had since living in spain croquets were slightly dry overall loved this place and the variety on the menu .
we were pretty disappointed with this place the prices are reasonable especially for wine but both the pad seeew and the green curry were overpoweringly sweet .
this is a great restaurant for just drinks or with tapas or dinner its absolutely lovely with a fantastic menu .
welcoming and simple food the oshinko pickles good shrimp tempura udon ok the chairs don´t have a back it can be uncomfortable but also cool another neighborhood surprise with bar and afterhours i rather eat a chinese noodle at mee´s .
fantastic food organic selection good service cozy atmosphere perfect for brunch .
had the karaage with curry udon it was put together so haphazardly that the curry hadnt been mixed into the broth one piece of carrot and one cabbage leaf no joy .
lovely i felt like i was back in barcelona or a warm sunny island even though its just the start of spring great fresh food and cozy atmosphere time flew by so quickly .
nothing at all for vegetarians vegetarians stay away all of their stock is fish stock and the place smells like it everyone else enjoy .
the turkish breakfast here is insane so much delicious food also tapas are greaaaat especially the dates wrapped in bacon and stuffed with almonds droool also everyone who works heresuper nice restaurant itself is also really nice and airy also you should go also .
no star deserved cant be even worse they want us to pay before we finished and added tips into the bill wo asking worst service ever ugly fat women as waitress .
this place serves an amazing brunch highly recommended make sure your ready to wait for a table .
i got hives up and down my legs after their udon my friend who also is in love with udon west went on a separate occasion recently and also got hives on her face what is going on .
we went to olea for the nye prixe fix and loved every minute of it the food was delicious the atmosphere was perfect its nice to have a neighborhood spot that manages to stay consistently good .
i was in town for an hour went to udon west on yelp recommendations and was sick until the net day salty nasty food they do have great service i will give them that bad yelp .
such a great experience here has a really cozy wood cabin feel inside even amongst the med flare i tried the hot spiced sangria and it was unforgettable also had chicken with pomegranate yogurt which was excellent looking forward to seeing live music there next time .
its actually a japanese bar so the place was quite loud the food especially combo and the price were good .
love the turkish breakfast i am addicted their dinner is amazing too really friendly staff and lovely atmosphere great neighborhood place .
very rude service old man who was our waiter has no idea what customer service means im usually pretty generous but i would leave zero stars if possible here if possible .
great place to grab brunch i am a big fan of both the chocolate filled croissants as well as the green eggs and lamb incorporate either of these and you will be a satisfied patron .
very mediocre menu and the quality of food was decent at best there are other great udon japanese places around midtown east that i would much rather go to so i dont think id ever come back .
loved it had a great time really enjoyed the decor and samon w mash potatoes very fair service i wanna go back .
bad service took more then 45 min to bring it out when came out cold pizza send it back to warm up again took more then 15 min to bring it out i have been there more then 10 times here before never had such a bad service .
went here for a light dinner of tapas and loved every bite the staff is excellent and the service quick particularly enjoyed falafel encrusted artichoke hearts and of course the sangria .
pizza was similar to a frozen pie nothing special there are many better pizza options in the area .
cheeses and hummus hummus and cheeses tasty tapas good service and a cozy atmosphere if i lived in the neighborhood id probably become a regular .
found a dead roach in my calamari .
plain great a wonderful settingindoor and outcomplemented by a smart and electic menu nestled in a quiet residential strip of a thriving fort greene permeated by a vibrant community feel .
bad service i had to wait for my food for 40 minutes after inquiring about it and then had to wait another 20 minutes to get a check after asking for it i am not going back to this place .
one of my favorite restaurants above average food and great service the space is simple yet elegant and has fabulous light avoid sunday brunch it is too crowded .
if you like 70s wood paneling budweiser and your typical old school underwhelming bar food this place is for you .
good food and wine the pita dip sampler thing was good but the hummus had a weird texture service was good atmosphere was great menu was varied enough to keep things interesting would definitely go again .
basically olive garden all over again this is not a tip its a review a tip would be find somewhere else to eat .
the atmosphere is awesome and who can beat their oyster happy hour oh and drink enough beer or wine to use the bathroom youll want to tear the walls off your own afterward .
new to mall next to cheesecake factory light entree tiplalia was tasty brio rewards program difficult to use we like the margrithia flatbread but wished it was on whole wheat not white bread .
great ambiance delicious savory interesting you must try the dates stuffed with almonds wrapped in bacon scrumptious menu the wait staff was a little wacky but if you want really delicious mediterranean cuisine olea is the place to go .
the wait staff are great my server was horrible the food was ok took my parents there for their 40th wedding anniversary the serve apologized profusely at the end when it was time to pay go figure i would never go back ever .
beautiful new copper bar and delicious food .
the restaurant seemed dated the food was overpriced and underwhelming i would not come back .
just ordered in from them it was a great meal with more than ample portions our favorites were the eggplant appetizer with balsamic dressing mozzarella and roasted peppers and the gnocchi with bolognese sauce we will definitely order from them again complements to the chef isabel m .
was not a fan of this place very bland curry that lacked the complexity you would expect let alone the heat crab rangoon was so forgetful my husband just reminded me we ordered it girl at the counter was sweet seems like theyre going through some opening pains .
today i had the salmon over escarole and white beans and it was delicious at every visit ive been impressed with my meal choice molto bene .
i really want to like this place because it reminds of the small lunch joints in seoul but this guy puts that nasty frozen vegetable mix in kim chee fried rice string beans corn and carrots wtf no fried egg on top eeny bits of kim chee sigh .
this place looks like a hole in the wall from the outside but its our go to take out chinese theyre really fast and the food is good we always get free sodas too .
seriously this s hole methinks definitely not ive tried way better waste of money and stomach occupancy .
ive been to quite a few chinese restaurants this one is by far one of the best the food is always fresh and delicious the people are friendly this is always my goto for chinese food .
patio is a mess broken tables trash and a distinctive smell of dog poop and garbage wth kellys clean up a little .
some of the best chinese ive had clean and fast delivery the guy who takes orders has a sense of humor that majes u call bavk to order .
one star for the nice patio but the last time i was there the salad was oily and inedible burger had to be sent back appetizers were ok service definitely lacking too bad new haven has so few options for outdoor seating .
roast pork lomein is amazing along with everything else delivery is consistently fast .
slowest service ive had in a long time wont give them a second try .
best chinese food in the area delivery can be a little slow but well worth the wait .
i ordered the duck big mistake it was completely well done by the time it came to the table it also lacked in flavor everyone elses dinner seem to look better than mine .
for chinese food its pretty good i get general tsos bean curd and they make it well .
very small portions for the price slow service our food came out at different times my boyfriends dinner was served 20 minutes before mine not going again .
found this place on a fly chicken and broccoli was yummy and the noodle soup is delicious they also can make their fried rice with brown rice which is a plus .
simply awful the potatoes were undercooked meatballs tasted canned fish was unfresh lamb ravioli was gamy an enormous disappointment given ibizas otherwise exceptional reputation stay away .
its good stuff for a cheap chinese takeout place theyre kind of slow usually but i see them back there chopping fresh veggies and all so its for a good reason .
one of the biggest dining disappointments ive had in connecticut nothing like its sister restaurant in new haven this location features underwhelming food and the absolute worst and slowest service ive encountered lately absolutely wont be coming back .
one of the better if not best chinese delivery in the bloomfield area .
beware when you order bottles of sauce i bought 2 weeks ago one and the best by date is 112013 it should be traditional but its now a gross smeling bottle of uneatable crap .
its our goto chinese restaurant in town theyre quick cheap and the food is actually pretty good .
2 a slice what do you think this is nyc nothing special you have better choices in bayonne .
this is probably my favorite pizzeria thus far 2 for a regular or sicilian slice yeah pretty awesome .
ive been here a couple of times and cant state enough how over priced and low quality this food really is 16 dollars for mehcaroni and cheese also the decor is mismatched and confusing .
ive had a lot of pizza in my life i have to say this place has the best pizza i think its the sauce they use 1 in my book .
we just had the worst service ever from this place the waitress wouldnt let us put three table small tables together for 6 people even though no one was in the place then she told us that we could go somewhere else so we left .
loved the nick hollywood we ordered during happy hour also ordered the mac and cheese and the fries which were great .
decent drinks but too loud too crowded and too handsoff for my taste at least .
lives up to its reputation as a top steak house on the national scale .
my experience was not terrible but i got some violent food poisoning after eating here if youre willing to take the risk go for it .
great ambience great happy hour their food is very good the portions are as expected from any pricey restaurant paltry would i go back maybe once every now and then but not that im dying to go back .
walking past the happy hour sign 11am 8pm 5 beer 6 cocktails we decided to have a drink after the show cabaret on saturday at 530pm at the bar we were told happy hour was only on weekdays beware of false advertising .
one of my favorite spots in brooklyn heights great place for a few apps and drinks or dinner the macaroni and cheese and brussels are amazing a must try .
service sucked sat at the bar for five minutes while three bartenders chit chatted in front of us never gave us a menu or took a drink order .
i randomly came here on a saturday night with my boyfriend i loved it food was delicious and decor and service was great as well i had the duck and he had the muscles both entrees were excellent highly recommend .
buy an id scanner or hire a better bouncer if you have a nj id dont bother coming here at night .
bar seat beer bread burger mussels fries .
terribly slow inattentive service pretty empty and in a bad location unless youre coming from the theatre the waitress served one in our party the wrong beer even after she questioned it overall nothing special enough to go back to .
went for happy hour and really enjoyed it looking forward to the next visit .
i walked in this weekend and the place smelled horrible like floralairfreshenerplusvomit and was blasting awful music my friends and i couldnt hear each other talk we left after 15 minutes no thank you .
some really good food here mac and cheese got the most praise but i actually liked the cheeseburger better .
not really impressed by the place this is a brunch review food looks fantastic but tastes lower than average drinks are not the best im town either it is quite pricey for what you get i am not coming back for brunch .
went here for my birthday had ricotta balls for appetizer very good grouper as main entree excellent and wine really good and great service i want to go back .
we were here on time but they didnt let us in or sit down because we didnt have one person coming we asked them for a favor because it was our friends good bye meal together however they disgraced us .
unbeatable happy hour special and for quality beers wines and cocktails not just the crappy well stuff that most places try to unload during hh we get the mac n cheese every single time the seasonable veggies have never disappointed winner winner .
go for the drinks and starters and not for the main course the drinks were outstanding we each had a muddled drink and shared the hot potato chips which were great however our main course was extremely bland the atmosphere is full of life and extremely loud .
great brunch .
went for brunch baked eggs huevos rancheros food is overpriced and average cocktails also average and not included with brunch ok in a pinch but you could get so much better .
one of my favorite burgers great wine menu and cocktails just great simple food im going to miss the neighborhood .
the food is decent and the waitresses are shitty and inattentive i got served raw pork the waitress never apologized and never offered the menu or checked up on us while we waited for the dish rude service but go ahead if you want food poisoning .
good neighborhood tavern the place is consistent and a blessing to have in a neighborhood with so few dining options the trout salad always a treat .
the food is plain average and not cheap but youll like the location .
really cute venue good food good service much less expensive than an equivalent place in the w village they use well liquor in the happy hour drinks so not as good a deal as you might think .
being generous here the food sucked period and when you add the price factor it really sucked about an inch of loose panko on the trout needed a shovel to get it off moroccan meatballs i think not .
great cocktails even better burger the only problem is there is always a wait when we stop by during the week so its busy almost always call ahead and make a reservation .
stopped in for a late lunch terrible service crap oysters lousy cold underseasoned steak with no char whatsoever at these prices there are far better options pass seriously pass .
one of the best bars in nyc and my favorite spot in brooklyn heights .
the food is decent but delivery takes forever service in the restaurant is slow and discombobulated if you dont mind long waits the menu is broad and will please most palates .
jack the horse tavern did a beautiful job feeding our party of eight before a barclays center performance the polenta was fabulous and the heirloom tomatoes were a perfect start to the meal the setting was cozy and we will go back again .
at best this place is only ok they excel at nothing but nothing is horrible either but with so many wonderful places in nyc im amazed this place survives with 14 mac and cheese and the like the service is good food is boring place is noisy .
cozy and inviting ridiculously good macaroni and cheese and appetizing salads menu is so appealing youll have trouble deciding what to order .
i dont like an egg in a tuna salad why do they put an egg in a tuna salad too salty and the place has the acoustics of a bathroom all tile .
delicious prixe fixe dinner menu highlights were the braised smoked pork belly appetizer mac n cheese and mussels in a white wine broth honorable mention to the peach almond tart dessert the service was attentive and friendly and the location is perfect .
when you need a lastminute reservation for 8 people on a saturday this place suffices but thats about it its incredibly loud and the food was barely acceptable and certainly not worth the price tag .
please dont go here i want it all to myself .
usually love this place and go quite frequently terrible front of house this time rude and inefficient food was great as usual but stuck us downstairs in the party room which i didnt know existed when there were only 4 of us disappointed .
excellent dinnerworth the trip from manhattan to brooklyn heights for sure highlights were the flavorful chunky gazpacho individual vegetarian pizza peach cake and dark chocolate gelato next time want to try the mac cheese which looked great pleasant atmosphere lots of charm in a quiet neighborhood .
this restaurant gave me food poisoning i had the vegetarian ravioli seriously how do you get food poisoning from vegetarian food never go here bad beer selection and food poisoning skip .
amazing food ambience everything i ordered the hanger steak and it was arguably the best steak ive ever had their drink menu is amazing as well its tucked inside brooklyn heights and youd miss it if you werent looking for it highly recommend checking this place out .
eh i tried this place twice and both times my food was flavorless i dont understand i had to add salt pepper and even hot sauce then i decided it wasnt worth eating no more tries .
brooklyn heights is a beautiful quaint neighborhood with breathtaking views of manhattan but it is not known for its good restaurants jack the horse is one of the only standouts in the area a good spot for brunch .
bland bland bland nothing outstanding just an average sit down girls gossip dinner kind of place brunch is a bit better but not by much the mussels and french fries are reliable but thats pretty much a no brainer .
our new favorite neighborhood spot amazing for brunch especially get the scone plate .
mediocre calamari served inexplicably with heaping amounts of marinara sauce on it rendering it soggy and unappealing flat overpriced vodka tonic incredibly loud this place isnt the worst ever but nothing to write home about .
yeah man i like this place a lot last time i was there i got the monte cristo that shit makes me feel mad fat but i dig it so much i dont be caring they could put a little more horseradish in the bloody mary though .
came here for brunch with friends food was bland the eggs were tasteless scrambled and sunny side the potatoes werent crisp and the salmon was too salty our waitress was sweet .
perfect little spot with just the right touches 5star comfort food not too expensive great wine list and easy to get to off the subway .
great place except the noise is so bad the meal was not enjoyable its a shame to waste great food on such a horrible place i could never recommend this to anyone but deaf people its girlfriend jane on w houston is much much better .
my wife and really loved the food had a fantastic beet salad to start and then had the halibut which was moist and delicious good beer selection and the ambiance is great im looking forward to going back again and id highly recommend it to friends .
great standard american joint with a great selection of tap beer and very vast menu options but the wait is always killing me and especially trying to grab a 7pm dinner or a 2pm weekend brunch forget it .
great food nice airy atmospher the smoked trout salad alone was worth the trip mmm will most definitely be back .
the food is good but if youre looking for a hip fresh sophisticated crowd this isnt the spot .
ive eaten in this restaurant many times and enjoy its atmosphere and service it sometimes gets busy on the weekends especially for lunch but its really a great spot i recommend it highly .
had a terrible pork samwhich there for brunch they stuck out brunch party in the dismal basement people just go here because other people go here and it looks to be seriously past its prime .
a lovely upscale but still neighborhoody restaurant the food is delicious even if not particularly inventive the trout salad and mac and cheese are both standouts but the burger is quite delicious as well great for brunch dinner or even just a drink and appetizer sort of dropin .
i have always had a good brunch experience here but dinnernot so much we had to wait forever for our table despite having a res service was kind of bad and my short ribs were nothing to write home about .
went there for a night cap friendly service good drinks nice atmosphere but from a design standpoint i would have went with a more historic font signage to compliment the historic structure surrounding area but thats just me .
i live next to the smith and it is always very crowed at brunch and dinner time i had pot of mussels once it doesnt taste very good though it may be personal .
if you live in the heights this is a must go to restaurant if you dont its worth the trip the service is nice the chef really knows how to mix flavors have the smoked trout with almond salad its fantastic .
food was forgettable dont remember what i had as an entree beer battered string beans were really good the place is obnoxiously loud and dark definitely more style than substance .
i enjoyed the eggs orleans which is an eggs benedict type dish with a fried oyster and artichoke nice brunch menu complimented by the jack the horse bloody mary with bacon infused bourbon .
the food was alright but it just wouldnt cut it for me honestly the only reason why i went was because of the photobooth and not the food maybe it was the food i chose that was bad but i most likey wouldnt go back .
if you live in the heights you have to come here great simple food have had some problems eating at the bar some bartenders here dont seem to like it but other than that its great dark and cozy can be loud not good for kids thank god .
crowded but im starting to wonder why and for how long it will stay that way mussles were not fresh the fried stuff is good but i mean its fried of course its good overall not worth the wait .
the food was quite good i had the duck and it was very flavorful and fresh tasting the drink list is extensive and interesting and perhaps somewhat overpriced 12 or more seems common .
last night i had a steak salad delivered there was a live cockroach in it enough said .
ill be short mac and cheese gotta love the gouda smoked trout salad skirt steak absolutely delicious in an amazing atmosphere a new favorite haunt in bklyn .
horrible service crowded .
phenomonal food was awesome cocktails amazing best bartender in the world .
impressively mediocre its fast and easy but the food is nothing special sadly i find myself here way too often .
great drinks both the appetizer a special crepe and butternut squash and risotto entree were amazing this is a place that is well worth the price nice atmosphere quaint and not too crowded .
not bad just not great if you want a quick meal decent food fun atmosphere and good drinks then go its going to be better than many of the area restaurants like the unos grill that it replaced .
love the hangar steak still great wine list .
ive had brunch here twice and its just too noisy ive eaten upstairs and downstairs and both times i felt like i had to yell to be heard by the other people at my table the food is good but not remarkable although my bloody mary was fantastic .
had a great valentines day dinner with my wife the drinks were really good with a great variety appetizers meal and dessert were great .
over priced over rated food not bad but the only thing special about this place is the sparkling and tap water in fancy bottles gets super packed especially now after being featured on mtvs the city .
five stars needs no further explanation .
too loud too nyu but they do take reservations for brunch .
adore adore adore located in such a cute place ambience great food delish very romantic the panna cotta supreme d did the prix fix and couldnt ask for more will go soon again .
they advertise come to watch world cup and the manager wont turn the found on scam .
nice quaint restaurant on a quiet block in brooklyn heights food was delicious and served quickly probably bc we got there early either way i had the braised short ribs and my fiance had the free range chicken both were delish .
had lunch with six other people lovely looking sweet service and subpar food a pasta dish lacked taste a spinach pie tasted like a leftover from a bad greek diner onion and green pepper side dish totally mushy and tasteless .
at brunch this morning i tried the smoked trout salad with grapes fingerling potatoes and creme fraiche vinaigrette life will never be the same the mac n cheese is superb oh but that smoked trout salad great cocktails too did i mention the smoked trout salad .
rude waiter small portions mediocre food overpriced good wine selection though 1215 per glass .
just eat here i had the steak thinking of when i go back .
only come here if you want to pay a ton of money for extremely small portions of pretty good food .
we had sunday brunch and thoroughly enjoyed ourselves the bloody mary hit the spot i had the savory crepe for the day with prosciutto and it was quite tasty its in a cute neighborhood by the promenade so great for a walk afterwards as well .
really bad italian i know lots of italians in town and this isnt good at all you can pick another one for sure .
this place is a gem went for dinner and had mussels and tried the mac cheese my friend raved about the mac cheese and although i was skeptical at first it really is that good a charming place to have a glass of wine and great food .
not had the chance to enter in as babies are not welcome smart enough by saying that theres a 1 hour and 15 mn waiting time to get a table while 13 of the tables were empty very smart but not enough will never make another attempt .
its always lovely to find something unexpected jack the horse is a british gastropub on an old street with great food .
dont bring a vegan here .
great food the best take out restaurant in hartford i been eating here for over 15 years give it a try .
the food is good but the service does not make up or it they constantly overbook and are not hospitable in the least in a city of many restaurants this is one to avoid you will be extremely disappointed .
my favorite pub in all of philly its a place where i can kick back with a few brews and just zone out my secret getaway from the regular pretentious center city spots great beer selection and killer burgers .
service uneven apps great main courses literally inedible definitely ended what could have been a nice night on an awful note i would recommend going to the bar for a glass of wine and apps only .
fish and chips was amazing fresh fish with the perfect crispy coating fantastic service our waitress was so helpful and accommodating great variety on the menu we came with 11 people in our party for a saturday lunch everyone was pleased with their meal .
sorry i really wanted to like them really but come on stopped by for a quick bite just pasta they accommodated cool ordered food crappy beer selection unless you like italian beer came ate not worth 50 bucks .
slainte is a fantastic happy hour spot where else can you get a bottle of rolling rock at 5 on a friday for 3 seriously where great bar food and wait staff .
service service service service from the door to the end of the meal one is treated like an atm food is superb but who wants to go here get service this bad .
best bar near the trainbusses at penn free peanuts fast service from my experience think chris was on anyway five stars for extra practical usefulness servce and a having a great beer selection .
food was good service was not didnt want anything special just a person to sell me drinks apps entrees desserts as the saying goes great service can save a bad meal but bad service ruins a good one this was ruined for me .
very trendy place great onion soup .
overpriced food was couldve been more tasty we had the pasta prefer babbo or lupa for pasta perhaps the meat dishes were better .
great happy hour convenient from 30th street station and friendly service its obviously not an authentic irish bar but its good if you are in a pinch and looking for something simple its great for prepsn drinks for the penn fields .
dont sell us wine at the bar then tell us when we go to sit at the bar that the bar is for dining .
i recommend the following plates philly cheese steak rolls addictive french onion soup good flavor fries im usually not a fry fan these are good good beer selection good happy hour specials lotsa slaintes going on here .
their preprepared bagel with cream cheese was old and nasty avoid otherwise its a reasonable downtown place to get your groceries at least on emergencies .
very cool pub with authentic irish bar and great burgers beer selection is extensive and they have my favorites smithwicks and guinness live irish music on mondays also .
extremely bad services crazy people and unreasonable bar tender will never come back again give us a terrible night at new york eve cant believe these people are so cold blood and not human .
havent eaten there but a great place to grab a beer after work bartenders are helpful and nice .
french fries were horrible over cooked and bland other food wasnt that great either drinks were over thought and complicated to the point of not enjoyable will not be coming back .
quite spacious and somewhat out of busy center city district but the atmosphere clean and pleasant i got a free beer glass when i was there cool chill happy hour time on weekdays i liked it .
the rudest bartenders ever made it thoroughly unpleasant .
an amazing experience a 7 course meal and every course is more delicious than the one prior the people are so friendly a reservation is definitely recommended .
i might just not be built for places like this anymore too big too loud too crowded bunch of drunk college kids pass .
the food and service was excellent i have nothing negative to say delicious .
nice place but i all i can remember from the two times going there that it was absolutely stiffingly hot .
place to go with your family and friends hospitality is one i their pluses they make you feel like family the moment you walk in the meal is fantastic and the atmosphere transports you on an adventure communal meal was a great experience .
gets the job done .
exceptional hospitality very accommodating host usually crowded reservations for larger groups highly recommended they had a belly dancer very cosy seating food was excellent loved the pata try with powdered sugar and egg and chicken filling baklava was great .
ridiculously overpriced for tiny bland sandwiches get it while it lasts cant wait to see what comes next .
omg is all can say about this place everything was excellent .
food was good service was horrible waitress was not very helpful or friendly wont be visiting here again .
this place is incredible delicious and for the food and service really affordable also its an incredible experience definitely recommend it to anyone looking for a special and delicious night come hungry .
the doorman was so rude to my friends and i that we will never go back to this place its too bad we loved going there .
so much food but so good this is the best place to go if youre really hungry authentic moroccan food hidden in the corner of south street i love it every time .
i finally realize that the fries here arent that good what makes this place interesting is the sauces but the fries cannot stand by themselves .
great food simple and delightful atmosphere definitely going back didnt rnkoy the lamb as much as i hoped i would next time going with the kabobs 7 courses all for 33 after tax and tip great deal dont eat lunch that day .
i saw this place on some old food network show when i lived in the midwest and was instantly hooked at the concept cut to 7 years later im in nyc this place was better in my head the fries are standard unfortunately .
amazing from start to finish all courses were phenomenal service great food was amazing house wine was okaybyob dining experience was great and the belly dancer was beautiful .
so overrated i do not understand the hype .
love this place make sure you ask for a table downstairs it more atmospheric .
overhyped overpriced greasy fries with mayo based dipping sauces heart clogging i made the mistake of not checking the menu before i went small seating area couldve been cleaner cant figure out the long lines or rave reviews .
my favorite place to go .
six cockroaches were just being herded out of the front door by an employee with a broom six massive cockroaches i loved this place but i am never coming back .
great for a group accommodating to groups of both omnivores and vegetarians full bar and byo very homey great atmosphere enormous portions come very hungry there is belly dancing on weekends and during the week by your request if youre booking a special occasion .
i definitely got sick from eating the fries at this place plus they are not belgian fries at all they are larger and definitely not as light on the plus side the sauces are very good .
i love this place because it is exactly what it is supposed to be nothing more nothing less the food is amazing the price is cheap and the decor authentic they have the best baklava ive ever tasted and the chicken is incredible e servers are friendly .
waited inside for my order to finish and walked out smelling like old stale oil and then fries soggy and oily tasting like old soggy oil with dipping sauces that just didnt have the flavors whats going on with here .
awesome place with beautiful decorations there was a belly dancer which was cool be mentally and physically prepare for a 7 course meal and pace yourself bring cash because they do not take credit cards .
we were really excited to try this place long line good sign right unfortunately we went back when there was a lull cold fries room temp poutine sauce and cold cheese curds yuck trashed it and walked out .
the place is absolutely wonderful this place is a must to go if youre in a budget looking for great food you might want to come very hungry .
very disappointed it really ruined my appetite by looking at their reused deep frying oil .
a seven course meal for 25 a person yeah its a lot of food and a lot of fun bring a group of friends and your appetites enjoy the wine and if youre feeling saucy attempt to belly dance with a professional .
there is absolutely no point in eating there fries are basic and sauces are super fat .
once again id like to stress the excellent and cheap house wines also soooo much food you cant go wrong the spicy chicken did it for me this time around when given the choice go with the spicy .
had the poutine meh canada can rest easy .
prepare to eat make sure you dont eat all day because this place will take care of your belly its a very small and cozy place .
hugely hugely overrated sauces are decent fries are just standard guy who worked here was also kind of a dick .
not much left to say about this place awesome dining experience great moroccan food but certainly not the best ive ever had the experience is really the bread and butter here bring cash also wish they would mix up the menu a bit .
just overrated although the fries were fresh out of the deep fryer they still managed to get half soggy i have lived in the benelux countries for some good years and i have eaten a lot of fritjes those just didnt raise up to the occasion very average .
fantasic restaurant the eggplant is the best ive ever had and the mint tea just doesnt get any better in the us .
i know everyone raves about this place but i honestly dont get it we hang out on the les a lot and have been here several times the fries are mushy and need to be drenched in sauce how does that make them awesome .
good food exotic experience .
was dying to try this place went couple of times and the service was rude and obnoxious dont bother .
phenomenal .
not the best at all fries cut too thick and potatoes did not have a yummy flavor sadly very disappointed one good thing was the curry sauce spicy and delicious and very authentic doubt i would ever go back i honestly have had better fries at five guys .
such a wonderful dining experience it really was like we were eating at a friends house because by the end of our meal we felt like we were part of the family great value for the qualityquantity of food i will definitely be going back soon .
smells bad from frites guess its from oil sauces are not outstanding .
we went here for a company celebration we had the entire space two levels and a 7 course meal the food was spectacular the drink selection was interesting but limmited i recomend everyone make it here at least once yearly .
i wanted to try this place because friends raved about it i was really disappointed that it was just soggy french fries drowned in gravy gross i threw it away after a few bites dont know what all the hype is .
a must i will write more but i am still overcoming the 7 courses that we ate without a break service bellydancing and just plain fun .
overly hyped yeah i said it the truth hurts sometimes doesnt it its just fried potatoes with sauces that arent hard to make i think people get carried away with the novelty of choosing from a variety of sauces .
bang on the unmarked door in a dark alley and a man in a fez will let you in nuff said a philadelphia must one of the coolest places ever .
its okay not really european fries at all okay thats all to say .
i absolutely love their pizza the sauce is outstanding ive also had their salads caprese panini and one with chicken red peppers and provolone all really good but the pizza is fantastic .
6 fries with weird sauces fries are nothing special sauces nothing special except a couple overhyped for sure prob cuz its small and its like omg they only make french fries here and i dunno personally im not impressed nor will i go again .
great pizza and friendly servers .
this place shouldnt claim to serve authentic belgian fries because they are far from authentic they are also over cooked and overly greasy a really overrated overpriced and underwhelming place .
we had rigatoni rustica heavenly linguine and franks famous appetizers food were tasty lunch menu has great value and portions recommend .
overhyped the fries didnt even taste that good neither did the satay sauce also nothing says the cuisine is authentic belgian like southeast asian workers in the store amirite seriously people overpriced thick fries with mediocre sauces shouldnt be getting five stars left and right .
excellent vodka rigatoni the owners and waitstaff are lovely have been coming back for years .
i wasnt impressed i tried the rosemary garlic sweet mango chutney and the parmesan peppercorn sauces and ive definitely had better in georgia it was overpriced and not good try it once just to say youve tried it and move on .
its a reasonable and a good food restaurant .
i love steak fries but this place was overrated expensive and a long line sauces were just ok maybe if the bag of fries were cheaper id give a higher rating .
i think the pizza here is the best in lawrenceville friendly people always hustling call ahead and the pickup times they give are always accurate .
i didnt find anything special about the fries ive had them on two occasions and both times the fries were overcooked the only appeal to this establishment is that they have many sauces to choose from otherwise you can get better fries elsewhere .
update been back 7 or 8 times since 1st review its faaaaantastic never disappoints .
wish i could give it a no star rating definitely not the best fries ive ever had i was so upset i stood on line for 15 mins only to get shitty ass french fries now you officially have the supreme touch .
loved it the waitress didnt know where we could go to get a bottle of wine but other than that fantastic .
fries are good back not too long ago the dipping sauces were free they got cheap and now charge 50 cents for basic condimentslame .
dominican food mainly prices are reasonable nice smoothie variety specials of the day and the place is clean to be continued .
this stuff is so gross its that food that you feel bad for eating afterwards greasy soggy potatoes covered in warm mayonnaise ew its gross just to write it i threw mine away after a couple bites if you are a bum then go here .
yes yes yes to the foie doughnut hummus platter spherickle fawntons duck breast beef and broccoli and steak tartar noooo to the squid and chickenwoffals fun place great concept adventurous food and delicious drinks .
update even the worst frituur here in belgium from where i type is leaps ahead of this place come here for your fry fix not for your belgian frite fix .
first off fawntons get them i always want more in my opinion this place continues to live up to the hype the staff are friendly and the food is imaginative and delicious also they make a great brunch their take on eggs benedict is delightful .
i can get these same fries at a bad diner ive been to belgium and these fries are not belgium style fries they were burnt and had no flavor the sauces are the best part .
great food great atmosphere great outdoor area fun events whats not to like .
bland boring below average fries mixed with great sauces to cover up for bland boring fries i dont understand the popularity at all .
sphericle shots great playlist bartenders on point best dining experience in bedstuy to date very creative menu at an accessible price point .
i dont know what the hype is about i have had better fries and better sauces not worth the trip but if you are in the neighborhood and want french fries i guess its worth a try .
charred lamb breast is mouth watering pickled shots quench the thirst dont ask the bus boy whats in a pickleback shot ask the waitress fusion menu good for the meat eaters out there and the veggies .
i liked the concept and the wide array of sauces but the fries themselves were lackluster ive definitely had better fries elsewhere many times over .
this place is a neighborhood gem foie gras donut that is all .
i think the premise is awesome of fries with sauces and all but really i felt so disgusting after eating it waaaaay too greasy and i am all for greasy food fries are also one of my favorite food of all time but not this time .
finally ate here the other night pretty great experience overall i think it is a little too expensive but the food is interesting and the dining experience is enjoyable especially the spacious backyard which have big tables that are great for parties service was on point great busboys .
only come here if you are a tourist who wants to look like a tourist this place has not been cleaned in ages its greasy its dirty and the fries are nothing special at all personally id rather eat at mcdonalds .
this place is great love the neighborhood atmosphere and food awesome bloody mary chicken and waffles were amazing we had venison dumplings that were so good too love the dishes they come up with cant wait to go back .
fries were soggy and the sauce was ok mcds wins my vote for best fries .
one of my favorite restaurants in brooklyn creative and comforting food and a great neighborhood spot great cocktails too .
not the healthiest came here once in search of carbs probably not coming back again contrary to many reviews here i really didnt think the potatoes or the 30 different dips were all that special .
bibimbap with sweet potatoes fries in place of rice amazing cumin lamb breast w fried egg wow i wanted more stomachs to fill here definitely coming back soon the most interesting brunch ive had in a long time .
i only went here once but my frites were overdone dark brown the sauces were good though .
cool restaurant fun and exciting menu good decor including readymade awning i like the location too the only reason for not giving 5 stars is that i honestly think they need just a couple of desserts .
these cheesesteaks are the worst ive ever had i dont get all of the hype the cheese wiz makes it worse .
we had an amazing time here last night sampled a mix of snacks and small plates and lauren the bartender turned us onto some tasty treats and the most original pickleback ive ever had this place is not messing around .
just ok and id say customer service isnt an important part of the their business plan .
chicken and waffles were amazing flank steak was a close second and the pork and beans were right behind them a great place and amazing food .
not so good anymore the last time i came here was in 2009 and it was still yummy somehow the taste has changed now this time the meat didnt taste so fresh and it was a little chewy cheese did not improve it either not coming back ever .
cant go wrong with this place whenever i have visitors i bring them to my favorite local spot .
overrated in my opinion but you have to try it at least once i completed a taste test of pats vs genos side by side and pats wins my vote however you are better off at jims or dalessandros in roxborough .
everything i had there was great love the hiphop influence on the menu justin is a genius .
genos is better but id only give that a 3 star very meh .
cornish hen and waffles rock killer cocktails made with care and expertise i love hipsters that can cook it up keep up the good work brooklyn youre doin it right .
i gave both genos and pats a two star rating because honestly i wasnt impressed by either the roll was cold meat chewy and cheese tasteless service was much better at pats at least they were friendly .
this hidden restaurant has an extremely interesting take on food foie gras donuts pond wings and more .
overpriced outside cheap ingredients add to that one of the trashiest collections of patrons in the city and youve got a real loser .
sometimes it is the little things those are some damn nice napkins you clearly put a lot of through into those and we thank you good food great drinks friendly staff .
no .
this place appreciates great old school hip hop brooklyn unique combinations of flavors and the customers gold stars for do or dine like a wind face rolex you just shine .
please if you are really looking for a cheesesteak do not get one from here soggy gristlefilled awefulness there are so many good options in the city none of which are anywhere near this intersection .
hell yes this place is a dream come true ive been twice and everything ive had thus far has been utterly delicious not to mention a creative drink list great decor friendly staff happy bellies .
the only reason it gets a second star is for historical landmark status i threw away half the sandwich no flavor at all its like im eating canned meat i get better cheesesteaks at dennys .
we tend to be food judges but hands down this was the best food ive had in brooklyn ever and quite possibly the best food ive ever had they could get a better dessert menu though .
wasnt all that impressed with the steaks ive had better elsewhere i didnt try genos tho maybe another time if steaks are your type of thing you should definitely try it ive changed my eating lifestyle so the food didnt sit too well with me .
had an amazing dinner here with my bestee chicken falling off the bone melt in my mouth delicious with friendly service i ate too much but i forgive myself its vacation .
simply overrated i guess if youre a tourist who wants chewy cheesesteaks and taking in the scene then its a 3 5star experience if you want a good cheesesteak theres other options .
a find on the clinton hillbedstuy border that id call hip hot haute cuisine the fawntons venison wontons of course were tasty and the duck breast was incredible with kiwi and fennel to cut through the richness of the medium rare perfectlycooked breast yum .
bad service better steaks elsewhere .
inventive fun good service excellent experience .
like genos its a great tourist spot but the steaks are average id give them 3 stars but they lose one because the next day after eating their food is a little rough .
x .
puke tourists really there is much better food in philly might be worth feeding to your grandpa if you think you might get a good inheritance .
the food is definitely eclectic and the drinks are on another level only diners who arent used to your typical menu items should come here .
meh .
favorite restaurant in bk sign outside throws people off but thats just part of the experience small inside but cute yard in back service cool waiters and bartenders food creative delicious but can be a bit pricey wish serving size was bigger .
overpriced and absolutely nothing special about it food tasted bland fries are the cost of another meal they charge what they do because it was on tv dont waste your time .
amazing service delicious food great drink selection .
if you rate this above a 1 you are probably a tourist pats and genos are both overpriced and overrated unless you are in the area and drunk at 3am go somewhere else .
never had a bad meal or bad service by far my favorite restaurant in new york and it just happens to be around the corner .
nasty attitudes from staff and how do you run out of fries on a busy day steak wasnt that great try genos .
i had such a good experience here i have got to get back .
the steak isnt that flavorful its as simple as that .
good drinks delicious food nice people .
overall mediocre food pats and genos are both overrated the lesser of the 2 evils is pats dont waste a trip to philly .
i love the fine quality dining deconstructed in a small storefront restaurant .
dry greasy nothing special arrived at 11 quick service you go here for the history and the experience not for an amazing bit to eat still glad i went .
fries lollipop chicken and the daily special were superb paired with a nice patio space out back and great staff this place is a real gem .
tourists only .
two words nippon nachos i could eat three plates of these seriously ive also had the duck yum and fish and chips yum my tummy always leaves here very very happy the staff and vibe are also great .
we tried pats and genos the meat at pats was disgusting fatty and tough and had a nasty flavor go to genos .
loved this great atmosphere great and crazy food nice staff we got foie gras donut taco tako duck wkiwi and fennel fish and chips 2 pickleback shots 2 negro models 1 bottle wine with tip the total came to about 120 or so great for date night .
one of the worst cheesesteaks i had service was bad too oil for the fries was dirty will not come back ever .
awesome i can never go back to regular waffles now .
we got two subs with provolone they were filled with thick tough and grisly meat and served with complete indifference the fries sucked and the soda wasnt even cold and they dont have a bathroom how does that sound for 30 bucks .
funky eclectic restaurant with attentive young staff order the whole fish lamb chops and chicken the duck was the only loser out of the main selections it didnt look overcooked but tasted rubbery nevertheless i would definitely go back .
they are small with very little meat cheese overpriced and very grissley .
i love this place it is so charming i always have fun here get the foie gras donut its crazy .
awful it is a tourist trap not worth the time it takes to park nor your money .
just go go in the right frame of mind which ive found includes being at least a little drunk and with good friends and then just enjoy the absurdity fun fun fun liquor license now here no more byob .
i dont understand the hype a subpar cheese steak at best my son and i had better cheese steaks at two other restaurants while in philly it may be worth a try to rate for yourself i believe many people will not be back a second time .
fun delicious food friendly service whats not to like sharing the small plates tapas style is a good way to go but dont miss the duck .
gristle and grease fries steak and water 17 just plain bad food at tourist trap prices the city has so much more to offer .
yummy small dishes but yum mm mm .
as my review of genos i will also give this place a thumbs down its a tourist trap again the meat is too dry and has no flavor surprisingly we enjoyed the cheesesteaks at the hotel we stayed in rather than pats and genos .
fucking phenomenal some of the most fun food ive ever eaten and the most interesting restaurant in the neighborhood and the surrounding six or so neighborhoods at least sure not every dish is perfect but that just adds to the charm .
overpriced rude greasy fast food youll spend too much be treated badly and feel like crap afterwards i suggest exploring philidelphia a little more and youll have a much better experience .
i love this place pure joy drunken food everything is excellent from atmosphere to service to food every time i go plus its practically in my backyard .
pats is ok it is over rated their meet is not the best their toppings are pretty good the line can get long so pack your patience .
delicious everything was awesome but i particularly recommend the duck and the lamb also best caesar salad dressing ive had thanks justin and george .
saggy cheese stake and no flavor at all just a touristic spot to take pictures thats all you wont find the real cheese steak here neither crossing the street .
yay this place is creative fun and the food is pretty rad to boot its brand new and a little late evening refuge for people in the neighborhood bed stuy do or die .
the food was mediocre at best the meat is stale and chewy not worth the price that said if you decide to do it anyways do not let the line scare you it goes quick easily 5 people a minute .
tried this place out last friday and it was as good as everyone here says it is great ambiance friendly people and excellent food looking forward to making it back here again .
way too much bread no where near enough steak took me almost 30 years to finally give this place a try and after having tried many cheese steaks elsewhere this one was average at best .
this place is really really amazing we had the tile fish crudo foie gras doughnut tartare lamb breast branzino whole striped bass roasted chicken duck all amazing its byob right now so bring something special to drink .
there are hundreds of better places to get a cheese steak in and out of the city this is a tourist trap .
went the on an early 600pm saturday night nice feel good staff and great food we had the chicken and waffles for comfort food and their meatball salad enjoyed both very much saw lots of different burger options being served and they looked great too will certainly return .
some people like the fat and tendon on their cheese steaks i dont there are so many other places to get a good cheese steak .
this place is legit the lunch specials are great i got the hawaiian burger which was delicious great food and great prices the service was great and the owner is a super nice guy you should definitely check this place out .
just awful steak was tough and chewy spit out a huge chunk of fat from one bite finished half the steak and i was hungry cheesteak wonions fries and bottle water over 15 at least the water was ok dont go .
i really love this place we use to come in on the weekends when i was a student a and every time im in town i always stop by the food is great and the service is really great great spot .
cheese steak was ok dont see what the big deal for this place is very over priced and bland better cheesesteaks in jersey .
i love this place really awesome food great bar and the upstairs is sweet i recommend burgers and the brunch .
it is ok tastewise to start with i am not a sub eater i am sure other people will appreciate it more than i do but if i get one it must be a good one .
wonderful place whenever im in new haven i would try and come back try the nantucket pizza it was awesome waiters were awesome both nights jamie and kevin are great people .
poor quality beef covered in oil and served on barely fresh bread come on give me a break people im going to checkout another place in philly next time .
yummy fries and creative burgers went there last spring but will probably try it again soon .
pats and genos are not philly for cheesesteak they are cheesesteaks for tourists oh the steaks are okay but if you want a great cheesesteak this is not the place move on down the road .
brunch is awesome the food was great i never saw the bottom of my mimosas and the prices are very reasonable biggest plus saturday brunch not a lot of places do that .
best thing on the menu is a 2 5 coke poor quality of beef covered with lard of cheese is not what i was expecting for 10 very disappointed with my first philly cheese steak in philly .
really pleasant service they hooked us up with free bloody marys when breakfast order got screwed up home smoked salmon omelette was very good and cool tunes playing .
you can get a better cheesesteak literally anywhere else in the city except for the place next door its equally bad those dirty little carts in center city have better food than this .
in my opinion is the best burger in new haven right now the food in general is solid and the service is excellent in nice weather the outdoor patio is a terrific option the atmosphere is conducive to having an enjoyable and relaxing meal with friends .
okay for a late night grab after drinking all night but you can find a lot better sandwiches in the city if you want to experince flavor and tender meat .
ive been a regular customer since theyve opened box 63 has taken its own creative concept ran with it and blossomed this is a place that caters to all tastes check it out if you havent go back if you have .
so overrated its a joke both pats and genos have become cheap tourist traps instead of trying to keep up quality .
the food was very good lobster grilled cheese with the best tomato soup ever and a pulled pork sandwich our server was wonderful the atmosphere was sedate its a good place to unwind and eat good food .
crap .
im a fan of this place amazing sunday brunch a couple solid house beers and solid southernstyle dishes in general i actually dont think the burgers are worth noting but would definitely recommend the jambalaya on the dinner menu great prices and atmosphere .
the steaks are all precooked in the roll and waiting for your condiments cold sad and flavorless .
ive eaten their twice nice friendly atmosphere great hamburgers pizza was good too check out the upstairs space .
go for the experience and i wont begrudge you if youre visiting philly or something but there are better options out there cant deny an original though .
i love this bar and their staff came in and had some cocktails while we waited for a seat at mu ramen the drinks were delicious the staff were so friendly a gem in the lic neighborhood .
pats used to be great but its weird and different now it was excellent in the late 90s .
french toast enough said .
tourist trap but theyre open 247 and they have quality cheese fries .
great twist and departure from traditional tapas had a burger with a little something extra to it service was some of the best ive had the owner nick made it feel like home will go back for the food and atmosphere .
not as good as i expected and kind of skimpy on the meat for 9 there was a long line and i think they just wanted to push out some food there wasnt as much flavor as ginos had when i went there last month .
came for brunch with 2 kids and was pleasantly surprised choice of 3 items for 15 all of which was delicious and kids eat free unlimited coffee plus unlimited mimosas for 5 really friendly staff it was a good experience we will be back .
tourist trap go there just so you can say you did .
came here on a whim great food and nice portion sizes for the price server was friendly and decor was nice but the food really stood out looking forward to returning .
overrated and overpriced skimpy meat on roll with cheese sauce .
holy sht that is good trio chips raw fish trio meatloaf and sliders boom cased closed gn .
went there against our better judgement for nostalias sake what a waste of time money and empty calories .
gerard and billy are the best the food is good here especially the trio of chips dip .
parking is not available the steak they cut too thick price is 10 sandwich little bite high the sandwich bread is tough well most of the business came from tourism how many customers will return .
really enjoyed my brunch here with my girlfriends the food was delish the mimosas flowing though more champs less oj would make it perfect the owner delightful and the server a hoot we had a blast .
as far as i am concerned this is a tourist spot like genos .
the place has a great vibe the small portions are ideal for sharing the food tasted great was fresh and priced accordingly will definitely come back .
way overrated .
emily rocks cute girl and fun she can do a rubiks cube with her eyes closed .
not as good as it was many years ago cheese fries are still decent bu when i want a good cheese steak i go to steves now its a shame but they just cant hold a flame to the way they used to be .
the food at this restaurant is delishious it is prepared with love and a wonderful sense for detail the bread comes with sweet butter i guess honey butter which is a great specialty all staff members are very friendly and do everything to make you feel comfortable .
its just a tourist trap theres nothing special about their cheese steaks and the lines are generally really long with tourists there are plenty of better cheese steak places in the city theyre often pretty rude too the same goes for genos .
nice place very friendly and helpful waiters and has a cool vibe food is solid some menu items are better than others the lamb pops are spectacular overall id recommend it .
tourist trap dont do it i grew up in south philly and even as a kid i wasnt impressed by these cheesesteaks not to mention the price for a whizwit has doubled in the last 10 years .
this place is amazing the best customer service you will find the staff is genuine and the owner is adorable words would never be able to describe how lucky we are to have a place like this so close to us .
the food was not very good and the fellow at the drink stand threatened to come outside and bash in my head i dont think i will go back or suggest this one to my friends .
great service and fun small dishes very cool decor good experience all in all .
my friends and i went here on a trip to phiily we wanted to try both pats and genos to put it simply pats tasted like chopped up white castle .
you have to try the quiche duck confit and the lamb chop eggs benedict .
the people who work here suck more than the steaks do guidos .
best food i have had in lic small plates great lamb chops tostadas veal meatballs brunch is awesome kids eat free bottomless mamosas and bloodies clean great staff and fun vibe .
noita .
great tapasstyle food interesting choices good drinks quiet but not like a library friendly staff recommend the naan pizza maybe a little slow on the service but we didnt mind .
terrible cash only and is a tourist trap .
very convenient to the subway stop good drink selection and décor i agree with the comments a bit pricey food but come in for the drinks and a bit to eat a good hang out place .
three words dont eat here its not even good for tourists they claim they invented the cheesesteak and maybe they did but they damn sure didnt perfect it save your money .
really happened in by chance ill be back great draft selection cool tunes interesting and effective tapas chef and gm visited our table and treated us like vips anyone who takes their business that seriously deserves to be checked out go .
its a tourist trap every true blue philly resident knows where to go .
open door is a great addition to lic the staff is friendly and makes it a point to get to know their guests thank you for making our blackhawks experience that much better .
disappointing i just wasted my time coming here theres nothing special on their cheese steak and rude service from the guy at the beverage window have that attitude if your steaks are really good and a musttry if youre visiting philly dont come here youve been warned .
went in for the first time today for brunch as was delighted excellent beer selection and interesting menu we ordered 3 items from the brunch menu dumplings and a salad everything we had was very good and the service attentive will definitely go back for the dinner menu .
nope .
great food and beers .
cheesesteak wasnt that great meat was chewey service was pretty rude not going back .
great addition to the neighborhood i enjoyed dinner there saturday night great music several small plates to share and all reasonably priced .
good for tourists not for steaks .
worth the trip plates are smaller but priced accordingly beers on tap are awesome service was exceptional ill definitely be coming back to this place whenever im in lic .
tourist trap big chunks of fatty gristle filled beef but dont worry because there is much more bread than meat go to tony lukes .
great place group had like 8 small plates all came quickly quality was high some plates were very original portions were perfect beer selection excellent service great will be going back only drawback was too much acdc on the stereo for my taste great addition to the neighborhood .
a little better than genos but that is not saying much i would not waste my time or money here .
best pepperoni pizza ive ever had pizza has a crisp crust and the pepperoni is to die for a must try .
skip it tourist trap .
brothers pizza is one of my top pizzas places the cheese on their regular pie is delicious i dont know whats different about it but i really like it their brooklyn pie is also very good pasta dishes are always good and fairly priced as well .
dog meat on a dinner roll this place lives on its legacy alone and is a tourist trap if you want a real cheesesteak go a few blocks away to cosmis deli and youll have the best sandwich youve ever eaten .
brothers pizza has the best diet coke and pizza their plain pizza is so good my favorite night is to eat dinner at brothers and then go to swals for icecream .
they sucked just as much as genos did bad cuts of meat no seasoning nasty tasting staff were rude when we drove up on this place it looked so cool but i soon realized well after my first bit that these two places are a tourist trap nasty .
great food every time the grilled chicken sandwich was the best ever huge amount of chicken and have to love it for high protein .
pretty much exactly what sarah a said its all true .
great pizza place you gotta try the clams off the hook great family place .
pats is better than genos but the steaks are below average to average less about quality of food than tradition this the place to go after a concert sporting event or late night out .
i was impressed i ordered food for delivery and it was quite tasty delivery was very quick .
pats is a philly thing you have to go once and order your steak wit or wit out but its not good save it for when family and friends come to visit .
always fresh always good chicken tostada salad is amazing and we love their tacos soup and nachos always ready within 10 min friendly service and the hard and soft shells are made fresh love it .
i hate this place even when its 3am and im absolutely plastered and somebody else is buying these are still the worst cheesesteaks ive ever tasted or maybe theyre the second worst between them and genos i dont know which is the worst .
love this place food is always plentiful and on point been eating here for probably the last 10 years always solid and reliable all the time .
it was nothing great i had both cheese steaks side by side genos definitely had the beefier taste though pat allows for more toppings it was overhyped for a mediocre sandwich .
tostada salads are excellent more of a take out place but they do have tables if you want to sit parking lot is always busy though and a pain to get back onto route27 however the food is definitely worth it .
no selfrespecting philadelphian would ever eat here when there are so many other places that have great cheesesteaks these are almost as bad as genos .
i had their chicken taco salad amazing grilled chicken avocado cucumbers tomatoes and lettuce in a taco shell their tortilla soup was good but spicy for my taste .
definitely better than genos definitely not worth being top 2 in philly dont buy into the hype hoagie was super heavy meat was decent after deallessandros i was upset overall you have to try it come late night no lines .
very clean and quick service very nice sized portions chicken burrito is to die for .
horrible they dont use gloves and thats gross the service is rude and the bread was barely fresh better cheese steaks in ny .
great food its always fresh like someone else mentioned it tastes better than the fast food chains my favorites are the grilled chicken breast burrito a side order of grilled shrimp .
gross dog food racists assholes dont eat a missteak in other words dont eat here or at genos .
i love this place always good always fresh and always consistent diamond in the ruff .
terrible food and the service is just as bad love genos .
delicious tacos i usually order the beef hard shelled tacos and my husband gets the veg options and we both love this place .
when i think of pats two words come to mind filthy and rude everyone out there reading go to jims steaks so much better and youll be treated with a tad bit more respect than this place .
the concept of this restaurant was very confusing asians who serve mexican food long behold it was one of the best burritos ive ever had and they deliver to rutgers love you la casa ill be back fer sure .
this was only my second time in philadelphia and i wanted to try an authentic philly cheese steak i came away pretty disappointed the meat is low quality and flavorless the bread is not that good ive had much better cheese steaks at chain restaurants .
food is delicious great tasting mexican food at a good price blows away the chains like chipotle and moes its a hidden gem in somerset .
this is a nasty meal with bad service and terrible value dont let the fact its better than genos make it worth your money both are to be avoided at all costs .
great for a quick lunch or dinner i have been coming to this place for years the food is consistent and there is so much to pick from i love the soft beef tacos with rice and corn the owners are very accommodating and friendly .
not all its cracked up to be go to a non tourist place for a better steak .
i love this place my favorite is the steak fajita combo it is the best awesome food always fresh from scratch the owners are super friendly and know their texmex you wont be disappointed it is my favorite tex mex place in the area .
average cheese steaks waaaaay overpriced definitely better than genos though .
this place is great they have good tex mex food and use fresh ingredients the staff is real friendly too i would highly recommend this place .
this is certainly better than gino across the street but it is basically a tourist trap the best part of the sandwich was the bread .
went for lunch and i had the italian steak sandwich it was terrific nice wine selection attentive staff not over bearing i suggest the balsamic calamari as an app next time i will try the special mediterranean chicken salad my friend had she loved it .
tourist trap go to delisandros instead .
this place has improved since they first opened just had a nice ny strip steak 19 99 and ther special wings service is also a plus karaoke on wednesday nights fun time .
cheesesteak is nothing special people that works there are very rude and will not make us come back dont make good reviews fool you if you insist try it but please if im right just kindly post it its worth sharing it .
had the special kobe burger with sweet potato fries was pretty good would eat there again good place to watch a game and get a drink .
food and service is poor cashier was extremely rude it is not worth falling in line and being treated rudely by inconsiderate staff not worth the money this is a tourist trap definitely not coming back or recommending this place .
ive been coming here for the last 4 years i loved it then i love it now warm homely service a good variety and quality of south indian food i love ending with their strong south indian coffee i prefer their south indian selection to their north indian .
dont believe the hype long lines fatty grisely cheap steak and rude customer service not worth it .
one of the best for south indian food buffet is not to be missed buffet comes with unlimited dosa types food has right spice not too spicy or not too bland will come here often .
overpriced rude employees terrible chewy bland cheesesteaks .
good dosas other stuff is average but you basically go to a south indian restaurants for dosas right .
the steaks were somewhat dry .
this was my second time ever having south indian food which a friend of mine loves when i usually have indian food it is never at a vegetarian place i really enjoyed the buffet and the dosas were great .
if youre in philly and want a good cheesesteak go to a cart or one of the million pizza places thats where youll get a real steak pats is just the touristy crap dont waste your time .
i give this place 5 stars a bit expensive but well worth it service extrondinaire is that a word food exquisite i will certainly come back .
eh its a cheese steak if you are in the mood for rude service the food is ok as long as you are loaded up on spirits the next day is usually pretty tough on the tummy but its late nite drunk food .
love everything about this place the atmosphere service and the food the food is well prepared their table bread is fresh and delicious once an awhile their coupon is released in the mail for 20 00 off on orders over 40 00 a steal deal .
ive have better cheesesteaks in suburban boston how disappointing btw this is the 21st century take credit cards .
love the pizza as an app love the breadcheeseolive oil thing when you sit down love the seafood my husbands steak was overdone for the steak salad meal but he sent it back and it came out perfectly go there enjoy .
too expensive too dumpy too little taste plenty of great cheese steak places in the city so why bother with the original who overcharges for cheap quality food .
this is probably my favorite restaurant everits a shame its 3 hours away from me i always order the same food the melanzana pizza anyone who likes eggplant and wants something very sweet should get it and the nutella pizza for dessert .
not a fan of genos or pats they were both either rubbery or dry and the amt of stk used is very little .
absolutely love this place the service the drink selections the atmosphere the apps and most of all the pizza pretty much my favorite restaurant in vermont .
i dont know what all the hype is my husband makes better cheesesteaks at home .
great food and service we were in town for a school visit and found this on yelp highly recommended .
i only go here if im drunk and desperate the food is average at best and the price is higher than most other places genos is just as bad both as pats would say a misteak .
fabulous gluten free pizza was awesome with the best crust ive had in a long time im pretty sensitive to gluten and they were great and i didnt even get sick definitely recommended .
i have only been to pats once so i really cant judge i do have to say with all the talk about pats steaks i was not impressed .
got the traditional margherita pizza it was very good love the ambience and the wood fired oven not cool that they charge you 3 for every small ice tea you get its definitely a little overpriced for what you get but overall i liked the food and experience .
i prefer chopped to shaved so i tried pats over genos it was disgusting either way i would suggest you try pudges in blue bell for a great steak with not soggy fries .
nice atmosphere great for a date good appetizers good cocktails amazing amazing pizza fabulous service .
a philadelphia tradition but not quite as good as their competition genos steaks car parking is a problem .
this place was great the pizza crust was so good as was the pizza in general the homemade mozzarella was a must have the owner and wait staff was a i would highly recommend .
there are better places that make and to eat cheese steaks .
terrific restaurant great management fun place to go great burlington restaurant .
there are many other places are as good or much better johnnys behind lowes on snyder avenue for one .
i love this place the food is amazingly fresh and light salad is excellent dessert is amazing i love sitting at the pizza bar watching the pizzas get made the service is outstanding i have not had a better experience anywhere in burlington they are the best .
overheard some workers talking and apparently they dont know what mdma is also one of them said he quit smoking weed but then he forgot my order so .
excellent food and great for kids too the antipasto salads and pizza are to die for everything is delish and service was friendly and fantastic .
no big deal there are plenty of neighborhood spots that are way better than being down here the ground is always dirty and littered too no thanks .
great pizza and great service will certainly go again soon .
my husband and i did a split compared both establishments if you like the plain taste of meat without any seasoning then you will like pats i personally like robust flavors bland is not for me .
best food ive had in burlington .
tourist trap go to phillips on passyunk ave .
i absolutely love this place fantastic pizza with housemade dough and mozzarella great drinks and beer selection really fun atmosphere great service the pizza tastes like highend pizzerias in brooklyn this is a great addition to dining in burlington .
not good there are way better cheese steaks in philadelphia dont get caught at this tourist trap .
having just had an unpleasant experience next store at trattoria delia i wandered upon veritas there i found an amazing staff pleasant and welcoming food was great and fresh and made before you bravo verita for a great experience .
ew .
verita is sensational from the service to the freshly unique appetizers main dishes desserts and drinks they serve if you want to spend some quality time with friends enjoying delicious fare dont pass up verita really .
tourists .
love this place my first impression was awesome the food and service was great we will be returning here asap .
overrated jims steaks in west philly and tony lukes are waaay better .
another welcome addition to the neighborhood a true pizzeria in both taste and service .
not the best steak spot in the city but the best on at 9th and passyunk want better try johns roast pork .
i had take out from here last week the margarita pizza and another one with arugula on top of it loved the crust and the simple sauce will definitely visit again .
its a friggin cheesteak with a friggin attytude i dont need plenty of way better steaks in philly .
best italian food in milford the chef and the staff are awesome the steak and pork is out of this world great italian steakhouse havent heard of one before but this is the real deal .
i really dont get what all they hype is about i can get this kind of cheese steak any where i went to both places and split it with my husband nothing to be amazed about ppl .
have now been back numerous times for lunch the cuban panini is fantastic .
touristy average quality long lines and wait time .
found ourselves in bryant park and hungry and so lucky to stumble upon this tiny gem the wraps were delicious and so cheap 2 for 10 plus they have mango lassi to go .
pats or genos how bout neither check out jims steak for the best steak in philly order cheese whiz wit and youll know why jims is best .
great find near bryant park wraps were delicious including the chicken tikka and shrimp masala could use more diverse less spicy options for kids but menu was packedwith yummy choices for adults .
when i think of the worst cheesesteak i have ever had pats comes to mind just go right across the street to genos trust me .
this is soooo good super tiny inside but plenty of character and the food is delicious service is fantastic and i cant wait to come back packed with locals is always a good sign near such a touristy area indian burritos .
most overrated subs i have ever had fake cheese hot dog rolls and more fat on the beef than actual meat their sub is perfect match with the city pats is located philadelphia disgusting and gross .
priced well great service i got the tiki chicken wraps i would def go back when i visit new york highly recommended .
kevin does your cheesesteak have cheesewiz pats team member look i dont have time for games here what can i get jew should have went to genos screw these rude assholes how this place is still in business i have no idea go to ginos .
i have ordered one paneer roll and one unda roll it was kind of spicy and so good even though the rolls are small it was filling good to try prices are reasonable i like indian food .
steak was cold i expected much better i guess i shouldnt have for a place better known for its tourism appeal rather than its food .
chicken tikka masala roll was delicious my only complaint is that i waited about 15 minutes for it while other orders places after me were called .
steak was tough grissly maybe an off day or a bad cut of meat but wasnt impressed and do not understand all of the hype sorry phili no disrespect .
perfect meaty snack lunch or dinner i had a beef tika wrap and a chicken tika wrap for dinner and they hit the spot flavorful and satisfying there are also several vegetable wraps and some with eggs good on the go choice just watch the drip of goodness .
the funny thing about philly cheesesteaks is that other cities actually do them better than philadelphia does them exhibit a i mean come on .
amazing place to have great tools in nyc authentic and nofrills place with good options i always go for the underchicen and add extra spice to it just works for me its a small place and they dont accept amex .
the meat was dry and flavorless genos is much better .
always fantastic dont leave nyc without a trip here if youre visiting the city there is something to suit almost every taste the rolls are flavorful not too spicy and not to oily either its deserving of the hype and great for a mid day snack too .
people who eat here are not philadelphia locals everyone knows not to go to pats or genos but if your really that desperate to blend in to where you have to pay twice the price of a normal cheese steak its still better than genos .
the chicken tikka roll is excellent and great value fairly filling not sure why they charge 0 25 extra for dipping chutney but otherwise great .
dry and no flavor made me feel like i was in the lunch line in a prison somewhere overrated and so was genos go to maxs on germantown avenue to get a good cheese steak .
i just abt get enough of my lamb tikka rolls with the tea came w a group of friends and everyone got 23 rolls .
rude service .
great fast food near times square good for the belly and the budget .
the original yes however it is not the best if you are craving a cheese steak after a night of drinking my choice out of all the tourist spots jims if ginos and pats are your only two options then go with pats .
first time trying these bad babies yummy fresh kati rolls whats not to like must have if you are not too hungry .
not worth it i could make it better at home unseasoned meat check fake processed cheese check cheap roll check not only was the meat overcooked it was unseasoned and they scrap you the grease next time i rather just eat a plain sirloin steak medium rare .
amazing yummie roll i went on a saturday at 1045 and the place was packed chicken tikka is amazing the place is small with limited seating but bryant park is close by so to go is a good option 5 stars my new favorite place .
the worst cheese steak i ever had period end of conversation .
went here during lunch hour the place was jam packed and it took us 15 min to place our order ordered the paneer and chicken rolls both were excellent and had superb sauces found it a little pricey but thats manhattan excellent overall .
i like genos better out of the two pats had nice bread but the steaks were dried out i wasnt a fan .
amazing rolls opens late on weekend shrimp was amazing size of the roll is small so you will need 23 min tried their mango lassi which was also amazing opens late .
better than genos but oaklands cheese steaks are better if your ever in oakland find mills hoagies about 7 will get u a hoagie steak fries and a drink pats n genos had the nerve to charge 15 17 got all of that .
why go to any other fast food place when kati roll is an option well priced fast service and delicious make sure you get extra sauce wish there was one near us in the palm springs area .
thoroughly disgusting a mouth full of grissle in every bite a digrace when i moved to south philly i thought there would be great steak sandwiches and pizza a total myth south philly steaks especially pats suck .
the rolls are very good we tried the unda chicken and unda shami roll the shami roll with mutton was excellent the chicken roll was good as well the shami roll was very close in taste to the kebabs on india .
overrated they are just as bad as genos i can think of at lease ten places that make better steaks .
pretty solid fast fare cant say the flavors are that robust and rolls come off as a bit dry we had the chicken tikka and the aloo potato but super tasty and convenient would definitely come here for a snack .
sorry its fuckin gross inferior cow flesh and chemical cheese yeah yum .
in our short trip to nyc we visited this place twice excellent rolls at very reasonable prices the chai is great as well very well managed and their manager scott is very friendly and runs a good operation .
meh wayyy overrated cute shop lots of great history and pictures but the food meh id rather go to arbys .
this place is pretty damn good i orders need roll and chicken roll chicken was little bit dru but i recommend beef roll juicy tender and full of flavors .
way to expensive for ok cheesesteak living on its reputation there are literally hundreds of places better and for less money .
perfect late night snack after broadway show cheap freshly made flavorful homey feeling im not even indian skip fancy restaurants pretentious people and pretentious food and grab a kati roll as and take a stroll around bryants park and watch the city passes you by .
for all the hype i was disappointed yes the bread is fresh but i have had better cheese steaks many other places .
had the beef tikka roll and the anda shami roll the beef roll was delicious super spicy while the anda shami was slightly less spicy but still good i wish they stayed open for longer .
wow this was really bad lukewarm meat on an average roll ordered american cheese cheese was put on cold roll with warmish meat cheese did not melt same problem at genos go to steves prince of steaks or ishkabibbles .
this place was a definite must try when in manhattan .
i came here a while ago about a few years so my memory is a bit hazy i remember it was cold rainy and a bit windy i dont remember the cheese steak so that should say something about it .
scott is the face of kati roll he is a tremendous guy and the food is divine my only gripe is the lack of mango lassi this week .
went today and it was awful i dont remember this place being that bad if this place was located in any other city it would be out of business dry meat absolutely nothing special sorry .
superb vegetarian options are available here pretty nice and cozy environment i really like the achari paneer chana masala and egg roll they serve nice indian masala tea as well .
this place is terribly mediocre i had really high hopes for unknown reasons and pats failed to meet pretty much any of them its an average sandwich at an above average price .
i love the 2 and the 13 their chai tea is excellent too .
simply overrated sorry .
inexpensive tasty and yummy food .
i just dont get why this place gets the traffic their meat is thick and sometimes tasteless there are many better places but they are better than genos .
awesome place try the paneer rolls look for scott at the counter he will tell you some great stories .
was really looking forward to tasting the cheesesteak here what with all the hype surrounding this place honestly was disappointed have tasted better cheesesteaks in many other places .
great food had the beef and chicken rolls too good scott is one of the coolest people as well .
tourist trap please stay away from this place cheap cat meat long 20 min wait for absolutely nothing how is it even possible this place got so famous .
gets super busy especially weekdays at lunchtime but totally worth the wait the unda chicken roll is my favorite but theyre all delicious definitely get more than one .
ok this place is all hype meat is ok the bread is bit hard the lines are long its probably worth a try but it definitely didnt live up to all the hype in my opinion ah well .
really friendly people the chutney is not actually chutney but all else is on point .
nothing special especially for the length of the wait so many better options in the area .
love the chicken tikka roll it has just the right amount of spices better option than chipotle i only wish they had a location in boston please open a location in boston .
way overpriced tourist trap 15 dollars for a sandwich fries and a drink the sandwich wasnt even good i tried tony lukes the next day and found it much better tasting and a little less expensive .
a must stop when i visit nyc love this place .
one word describes this place shit ill go to jims or tony lukes next time like i know i should have .
the food at kati roll company is delicious at first i thought that 3 rolls would have been way too much food for one person but because the rolls are so small and light i didnt feel bloated also its adequately priced ill certainly visit again .
very small greasy cheese steaks if you live in philly you dont eat here this is a tourist trap .
chicken tikka roll best ever .
if pats is really trying to beat genos why are the sandwiches so much worse i ordered a cheesesteak wid onions and cheesewhiz at both hands down genos wins .
very good tasty and quite healthy but you should take two cause the rolls are quite small and the cashier told me that the bread is handmade by them and i trustem .
famous but not sure why got the whiz wit bread barely chewable steak underwhelming whiz bad had to load w ketchup to make edible someone point me to the real king of steaks pats would get 1 star if i could give ginos 0 .
very good kati rolls and the bottled lassi drink is a nice touch came here for an after work bite and this place doesnt disappoint will def come back for the paneer rolls anytime .
gross tourist trap the pizza place up the block has better steaks without the attitude .
yum random find late at night this past weekend the food is convenient and very flavorful i am also a fan of anywhere that has solid late night vegetarian options minus one star for being very tiny with no bathroom .
mean staff soso steaks pat is the steak nazi .
loved this little place everything very fresh and people are nice they do a few things really well highly recommend .
im sorry to say this but the one i had was a little dry and not all that tender maybe its because its sliced thicker .
love the chicken tikka rolls consistently good its like an indian burrito but spicy also prices are reasonable only negative aspect is waiting in line during lunch but thats expected .
checked out both pats and genos not sure what the big deal is no flavor all i can say great tourist trap .
overwhelmed by tasty options bring on the heat very impressed by the one stuff with shrimp then again think i like em all .
pats and genos are both a waste of money theres nothing special about a guy putting an unseasoned overcooked and overpriced piece of meat on a roll and tossing it in the customers direction .
delicious lunch of chicken tikka roll and aloo potato roll get here before 1215 to beat the crowd .
definitely not the best ive had neither was genos it was exciting just to experience an authentic philly cheesesteak .
somehow the rolls at this location tasted better than the same ones we had at mcdougal weird good stuff love the healthier whole wheat roti option achari aloo is my fave .
the service sucks the guy that took my order the past 2 times acted like he was too good for anyone the meat isnt good the bread isnt good the cheese is okay the fries were hard people only eat here for the name .
scott the manager was needed to spice things up with the service to the already spicy rolls good job .
pats is a rite of passage get it over with so you can really go ahead and have some cheesesteaks elsewhere .
so good and open late i love every kati roll ive ever tried here my only complaint is that sometimes the onions are too thick and overwhelming .
if you are a tourist and are looking for a good cheesesteak do not go here it is a tourist trap and cheesesteaks they hand out are subpar save yourself some time and go somewhere else .
great atmosphere with quick service food was very good at the price well seasoned and the aloo masala roll had a nice heat that came after you were able to taste the rest of your bite .
extremely disappointed the only reason i gave it another star was that its across the street competitor genos was worse .
my second trip here and its even better scott the manager stopped by and talked with us about the store and made us feel welcome the rolls are top notch .
please dont plan your entire visit to philly around the cheesesteak debate you will be sadly disappointed when you sink your teeth into one of these sandwiches the cheese whiz addition was pretty fun but the sandwich is basic and the customer service is nonexistent .
this place is awesome went there for the first time this winter the kati rolls are filled with flavor the only drawback is there isnt enough seating we had to wait 15 mins to get seats .
the question of all questions pats or genos and the answer they both suck .
fantastic rolls so flavorful and perfect spices i tried all the rolls and chicken tikka and achari planner were best and unda roll came a close second chaitea is good too great place to grab a quick bite .
completely overrated and overpriced 8 00 for a greasy steak with tough meat the cheese wasnt bad and at least the fries were crispy definitely not coming back here especially when a food truck can deliver a much better sandwich for half the price .
kati rolls are great and wide selections i get their beef kati roll and aloo kati roll are some of my favorite and for nyc the price is reasonable .
marginally better than genos across the street thanks to the use of real cheese not whiz it too really is out of the way and overcharges on its tiny steaks go elsewhere .
we had the shami kebab chicken tikka roll and unda aldo roll as well as mango lassi it was delicious only 56 per portion portions are not big delicious definitely coming back .
overpriced garbage genos are better but not by much they both suck chinks steaks on torresdale avenue is still the best cheese steak in philly .
its so good thats all eat here .
better than the genos option for tourists i suppose .
love it i ordered the chickpeas one and the standard one forgot the name of it the standard was pretty spicy for my taste i loved the chickpeas and i had the chicken one before also super yummy cant wait to go back .
pats steaks blows go to steves or chinks steak hoagie or fruscos if u want a cheesesteak pats is a overratedoverpriced tourist trap that lacks taste and a quailty roll place sucks a bag of ds .
so good the salad was good the beef and chicken rolls were good .
the most overrated cheesesteak place in philly do you like dog meat do you like attitude with your dog meat then go to pats .
must try absolutely delicious i had the chicken unda and the panner roll i felt one roll was enough a little heavy loved the pickled red onions in side the roll and recommend getting the green chutney its not spicy .
the second stop famous supposedly it was the first one they prepare your cheesesteak really fast the meat is dry their hot sauce is good its not as salty as sonnys but dry meat .
to my experience the best of the kati roll companys locations take on the egg and the new shrimp roll an absolute oasis in the desert that is the midtown lunch scene k .
went to pats liked leos better i was behind a guy who screwed up his order so i got the residual attitude and therefor a substandard sandwich not enough meat stale bread bogey .
great place for a quick bite for bestauthentic results get the unda chicken roll and see if this will up the spice factor for you .
as overhyped and bland as a tourist trap can get all the grease price and wait without the flavor character nor experience ive had way more tasty cheesesteaks with cheezwiz at random nyc diners than pats .
their paneer rolls are to die for would make a trip to the city just for them .
this was perhaps the worst cheese steak i have ever had the flavor was awful my wife and i both threw our sandwiches out after a couple of bites .
indian food rolled up yummy and unique .
super dirty the pigeons love it .
anything with eggs taste awesome here .
poor service food was middling at best and we saw mice squeeze in through cracks around the back of the building first and last visit .
my 3rd time here and gets better everytime i really enjoy the chanaaloo masala roll with mint chutney on the side very nice and clean i just wish they delivered .
disappointing it was blend and the bread was hard the guy that took my order had an attitude i should have punched him in his big mouth .
i dig it .
terrible terrible terrible bad service not that i was expecting top notch horrible cheesesteaks yuck and is no comparison to tony lukes nuff said .
nice place simple menu love the aloo roll and the chana roll the paneer achari was good too but a little bland to my taste now i know where to get a satisfying lunch around office .
a man made me a steak sandwich without wearing gloves or washing my hands after handling money it was fine but unsanitary a small sandwich for the price id prefer genos because it wasnt an old register hand .
why is this place not a chain i would love it here in jersey .
wow the hype kills the experience bread was dry and the meat was blah great steak at the mall tastes so much better the cheese fries at least made this two stars .
perfect lunch spot or for a quick bite i had the unda chicken roll and it was delicious .
awful the steak was greasy grizzly and flavorless the woman who took our order was a pushy bitch the place was filthy it has gone significantly downhill since we were here two years ago with so many great steak places in philly i doubt well be back .
many times ive enjoyed this midtown spot for lunch when the office their prices are reasonable and the kati is excellent i cant even recommend something specific here because everything is delicious .
do not waste your time i had one bread tasted like paper meat like rubber the ketchup was good though pats gives philly cheesesteaks a bad name .
delicious these rolls are such a good idea and they taste great if i were to give a small critique my husband thought they were a little dry so maybe a delicious sauce in the rolls would top it off .
honestly i dont see what the big deal is about the cheesesteaks in philly i guess when your city is a god damn toilet you have to find something to brag about .
i love carbs i love meat you cant go wrong here simple but great concept i kind of wish they had a food truck as well since delivery doesnt reach my apartment price could be a tad cheaper but still yummy .
ishkabibbles eatery is where you need to go tourists do yourself a favor enjoy fun eclectic shopping before or after the best most hearty fresh cheesesteak in philly the link below will bring you to the rest of my thoughts info about ishkabibbles yelp combizishkabibble… .
this place never disappoints amazing food and very quick service .
i wish i could throw up on the screen and post that instead .
amazing i always heard of this place from my friends it is a definitely a musttry place in new york definitely spicy but really good the prices are high considering there is not nice decor in the area .
i cant believe ive not written a review about pats pats is worlds better than genos now beings as though genos is crap thats not saying all that much i get friendlier service at pats the steaks arent cold and its a more inviting atmosphere .
i can already tell this will be my weekly treat between scheduled appointments the shami unda roll is divine and the chai is good theyre pretty helpful about telling you spice levels for the various options cant wait to try them all .
ew i got a wiz with and it was terrible the roll wasnt toasted and actually cold and stale the meat was full of gristle and the cheeze wiz was lukewarm and thick it was overpriced garbage dont go here .
aloo masala make it two for 8 25 and youve got a lunch and then some vegan delicious outstanding spice man i love this place highly recommended cheers .
awful food served with an equally awful attitude mine ended up in the bin after a couple of mouthfuls i dont get how this dirty little place ever got on the tourist trail dont be a sheep go give your hardearned cash to somewhere that cares .
very tasty wraps and the ones we tried one with egg and one with potatoes were not spicy it was also interesting to see them making the rolls and the chicken and beef .
pretty damn weak for whats supposed to be the mother of all steak sandwich its a truck stop with more efficient ordering system dont waste your time here .
best lunchie idea ever i cant wait to go back i had the mixed veggies and chicken tikka rolls and they were perfect .
pats sucks so does genos if you want a good steak any lunch cart is better or try the ethiopian cheese steak at gojjo in on baltimore ave .
craving quick indian lunch near bryant park head to this spot quick rolls of meat chicken veggies shrimp wrapped in indian bread with onions and spices .
dont bother go down a few blocks so cosmis pats is nasty greasy and dont give you a lot of value for your dollar read little meat also the sweaty guys slopping the meat onto the girl really dont do it for me .
had the chicken tikka rolls i think you need two to be full delicious .
ah the line even though everyone told me not to try it i had to check it out boooooooooooooo oooo lights across the street let me see .
im giving the shrimp roll five stars and this place gets an overall four stars because i thought everything else was good but not amazing .
better than genos but still just an overpriced tourist trap you can get a better steak at most pizza joints and lunch carts .
one word delicious their chicken tikka rolls and achari paneer rolls are the best authentic and delicious the food is cheap and tastes best when eaten hot and right away a must try .
a little bit better than genos but still sucks .
best in us definitely worth it .
being an out of towner i wanted to try a famous philly cheesesteak i didnt know i had to order one in the local vernacular got whiz wit it was ok kinda small for the price i think ive had better in nyc .
love the roll .
absolutely horrible i do not recommend this place at all theres gotta be much better cheesesteaks .
good chicken tikka roll paneer tikka roll was good too its a great place for a light meal or snack flavorful and good but not great enough to deserve 5 stars .
pats gets one more star than the notorious genos because its slightly less xenophobic and the owner isnt as much of an ass clown otherwise see my review for genos and youll get the idea .
very tasty there was a line out the door for the lunch crush i dined in and still was out the door in 30 min .
completely underwhelmed .
great place and awesome kati rolls went there on a sunday i ordered 3 rolls and was out the door in less than 5 minutes big flavors small prices .
i dont like pats or genos but anything taste good when im loaded at 3am and then i would have to choose genos pats steaks taste like shoe leather .
the taste to price quotient is very very high for this restaurant the oldtimey bollywood theme is pretty cool even though the place is run by bangladeshis not indians the service staff is quiet grumpy even by nyc standards .
gross dude ive managed to avoid any brushes with e coli thus far and id love to keep it that way that said ill stay across the street where i can see whats going into my cheese fries thanks .
any shami roll you eat here tastes pretty awesome because of its flavor there is not much seating here so best take your roll to go .
when it comes down to pats and genos i always just go to the place with the shorter line im going to drop pats rating a point because they usually have the longer line .
two thumbs up for a great indian style fast food joint perfectly spiced and seasoned the wrap paratha was a bit greasy but was quite satisfying .
dear dickhead behind the counter since this is a major tourist attraction youd think the fatso taking orders would realize we out of towners dont know the proper ordering lingo wiz with mushrooms with with without blah blah blah etc not that good .
love this place always excellent and fresh not giving it 5 stars because the wait is often ridiculous and you dont want to dine in always order to go and hike over to bryant park way better .
the only thing worst that a genos cheese steak is a pats one i just can understand why people make such a big deal about them other than local rivalry .
easily the best kati roll in nyc having landed from india couple of weeks ago and the chana masala roll is as good as the one you would get in india great job in keeping the taste as authentic as possible .
if i could figure out how to give zero stars i would slow mediocre food how does this place have 4 stars wish we had tried the indian place down the street .
indian food wrapped burrito style is a product of american fast food ingenuity that i hope will sweep the nation of its feet .
disappointing afghany restaurant in olde city the ariana kabob chicken beef and lamb was served on a large platter that was predominantly rice and a few small pieces of meat the meat wasnt good the service was very slow cant think of any reason to come back here .
can not go wrong with them eat all varieties to find your favorite .
dinner started off great with a nice cozy atmosphere and some tasty sambosas but things went downhill quickly after that i had the lamb corma which was bland and left much to be desired overall it was pretty disappointing .
looking for a good fast indian place this is it really love this place 8 unda chicken roll is the best its worth the price and the lines always out the door take my word and try it out .
tasteless and overpriced all around dont forget the waiter and his attitude maybe we ordered the wrong thing and the lamb hummus baba ghanoush and salad are just their bad dishes idk very very meh .
just one word for this place awesome .
disgusting they had cockroaches and rats droppings coming from the basement i went there to eat with a friend and it was disgusting when i saw the cockroaches there was rat poo and decided not to eat and left .
delicious maybe not the kindest service but the food compensates for it .
these people are messed up racists they will add a gratuity to your check if youre a person of color and omit it if youre white dont patronize them they suck there is plenty of good food in brooklyn without giving money and business to racist aholes .
a great spot after a late night out i only had one vegetarian kati roll but my friend who took me there insisted on getting two absolutely delicious and im already a big fan .
this is probably the worst middle eastern food ive ever tasted yes the food was fresh and waiters were nice but the good was totally blend we ordered 4 dishes and salads and everything tasted exactly the same there was no flavor at all .
awesome rolls i had 8 chicken with egg just enough spice but not too much .
the chicken was amazing i was disappointed when my friend and i were refused entry into their outdoor eating area after ordering our food they said it was table service if you want to play that card you better get your wait staff ready to explain your policy .
visited twice and was not disappointed achari paneer ftw .
ive been ordering food here happily for over 20 years theyve recently changed staff its a change for the worse the food is not nearly as good the staff now is rude and extremely unpleasant tonight was the last time i go there too bad .
i went to grad school in this neighborhood and never knew kati roll existed such a shame so many lost mealtimes experiencing total satisfaction the vegetarian potato roll rocked my world .
they fry the falafel once in the morning and microwave it during the day chicken tasted weird definitely not middle eastern or mediterranean also tables were not clean would not come back .
very yummy especially 7 chicken tikka roll if u like shrimp try 13 shrimp masala roll .
i ordered the fallafel sandwich and was greatly disappointed as it had very little flavor i also ordered the bean salad which was not so great the only great part about this place is the bread which is pretty good .
really nice decor food is way cheap and delish i just really enjoy it number 7 and 11 are the musteats .
went there a few days ago for dinner what a disappointment i ordered talapia and it was so overcooked and chewy my wife ordered chicken and pasta marsala same drill pasta cooked for probably 20 minutes just disgusting stay away .
good food with the right amount of heat for the price it cant be beat .
expensive and irrelevant aside from ems and llbean together in one place .
this is a great lunch spot in the midtown area the food is delicious the service is quick and there is quite a wide selection also a great place to bring any coworkers that need a vegetarian option as well .
discriminatory against vegetarians the only vegan item on the menu is smaller than the meat ramen and it is significantly more expensive popular items are gone so it is a big disappointment after a half an hour wait not worth it .
cheap filling spicy food in a nopretensions atmosphere and always a good sign when an ethnic eatery in manhattan has several patrons of that same ethnicity i only wish that there was one in my nabe .
not the real thing even the hong kong shop was better no nori tasteless pork disappointing .
big fan ordered for delivery with a couple of coworkers and we all enjoyed it very much very warm and filling and it is a roti wrap i recommend the paneer and the chana masala roll .
not as i respect the noodles dont taste that good .
aloo masala hit the spot perfect walking food .
meh ive had better elsewhere in the city the broth in my shiromaru hakata classic was bland and underwhelming for all the hype its definitely overrated and definitely not worth the wait .
oh my goodness bless you kati roll for you being open late night to satisfy cravings in the early morning hours spicy kick to keep me awake and going through the night for all of this and more you deserve four stars .
ippudont terrible experience from the hostess giving inaccurate wait times to the waitstaff pulling food out of our partys hands while the food was being consumed to being yelled at by the manager overpriced lesser cuts of meat and no broth never again .
excellent kati rolls the meats are moist and flavorful and they offer whole wheat roti i like these more than the cart nearby but with that said this place is more expensive you get what you pay for .
i waited for about an hour to get in and ordered classic ramen the second modern ramen with pork buns ramen was good but not worth for the money 15 and time that i waited for i prefer totto ramen .
oh my good god the chicken tikka roll is divine this place is no muss no fuss great food and hits the spot im a repeat repeat customer .
horrendous wait and management of the wait i cant speak about the food very informed because after 1 5 hours of waiting we were so starved that anything tasted good .
stopped in here around midnight after seeing a show and it was the perfect quick bite we both had the chana masala roll extremely tasty quick service affordable prices a fun crowd highly recommend .
loved it a couple months ago but it has become way too trendy horrible rude service especially by a waiter named robert they charge more for hot sake than nobu absurd .
i like this location better than the one in west village tasty and reasonably priced indian fast food a lovely treat .
absolute waste of time after a 2 hour wait the restaurant ran out of all vegan and vegetarian options never again .
knocking them a star since the lewala down on bleeker and macdougal has set the new bar for kati rolls in 2011 .
it is annoying when a restaurant merely tries to accommodate vegetarians the vegetarian ramen is basically like drinking a bottle of sesame seed oil with a few noodles some grains of brown rice and a few odds and ends thrown in spare me .
positively addictive love this place the channa masala is my new favorite .
terrible experience waited an hour and a half food was mediocre at best and saw a cock roach crawling around .
ive only been for lunch the line gets long but moves fast their rolls are delicious try the shrimp masala .
maybe i need to go back again because i dont get this place ive got a few times but this jackofall trades has never impressed with quality or prices i would lower expectations before checking this place out you might be disappointed .
i live a block away from this place and it really hits the spot they are consistantly good at making kati rolls the only complaint is that the rolls are too small .
not really a great diner in any way even the service is just meh the only great thing about this place is that its 24 hours .
ohhhh how i love kati roll if im ever in times square i always getit so good so perfect great consistency and flavor all they way through the roll amazing the unda is my favorite if youre going def try that one .
wow thats really bad pizza .
sooo good a great find have had the egg less spicy than the others chicken tikka and yesterday tried the mixed veg with beets delish very cool concept .
empanadas were delicious but the grilled sirloin steak palomilla a la plancha was really overcooked and dry not good for 18 just get the empanadas .
great food super quick and cheap a small quick eat kind of place that is always busy try the aloo and achari paneer rolls .
the service really bad very rude the food is kind of good and the natural juice is from a bottle .
achari paneer is awesome reminds me of home need three rolls to fill you up .
i dont care how good these empanadas are my office placed an order at noon and it is now 148pm and we are still waiting for our delivery order .
cheap and delicious indian snack which feels like a meal if you have 2 rolls if you dont believe me then check it out for yourself my testimony is in the many indians that youll find eating at this fine establishment .
staff is really good friendly and attentive the food is less than stellar i dont see how people can call their food cheap you need at least 3 empanadas to feel full and the entree dishes are not cheap at all wouldnt recommend this place .
i came here by recommendation and tried achari paneer chana masal unda chicken and unda beef everything was so yummy and the flat bread was just soo good i could eat this every day too bad they dont accept amex .
beware salty salty salty empanadas i perhaps had 5 refills of water tried the recommended empanadas brazil cuban spicy chicken chorizo viagra serve with a spicy red sauce creamy chimichurri service is fast and prices are cheap disappointed with the taste .
absolutely love this place the panner wrap is amazing i had it twice on my visit to nyc ive had many imitation kati rolls in the bay area but nothing compares to this place definitely a must visit if you are ever in new york .
the empanadas were great except for the fact that i got really serious food poisoning i had 1 chicken and 1 beef so it could have been either .
for a us indian fast food place excellent hit the spot get the chicken unda riveting .
okay food horrible service .
love the kati rolls here especially unda beef and unda chicken rolls although biryani cart has my favorite kati rolls the kati roll company is my second favorite and then have tablesseats which isnt an option when you purchase at the biryani cart .
no service did not get my food even though my friend did had to ask for a water refill 3 times .
oh heck yes this place is delish the chicken one was ok but take this with a grain of salt im not the biggest chicken fan but omg the achari paneer roll rocked my world so freakin good .
rudest people ever .
i love this place i usually get the chicken and egg roll but ive been wanting to try the others it can be a bit greasy so its not exactly the healthiest but its just so good i dont even care what its gonna do to my waistline .
plantain chips and guac 5 stars everything else meh sure the empandas are cheap but our tables were dry and didnt have enough flavor the arepas were probably some of the worst ive had the corn cake was fried to a crisp woof pretty disappointed .
man i think these rolls are made of crack had one been back here everyday the chicken rocks .
good empanadas horrible service .
this is an awesome place to get lunch good food real food not fast food junk and really cheap my coworker and i managed to get a table but im not sure thats often the case if you live or work nearby a great choice .
amazing empanadas but i will never ever go back because of the service im sorry but a 24hour empanada service with attitude that sounds like an oxymoron of epic proportions go to galaxy diner on 8th for far better food and nonbroadway nonbitchy food service .
this place never seems to disappoint when i visit nyc my favorite rolls are the chicken and chickenegg the rolls are delicious and the prices are reasonable i always make sure to ask for extra chutney since it is a favorite of mine .
delivery also takes over an 1 hour its the closest place to my place to get empanada ive had much better but when i have a craving i have no choice .
just delicious i ordered the chicken and the potato roll both really good the potato roll reminded me of a home made mexican taco de papa oh lunch hour reaaaally busy there is literally a line outside of the restaurant so get there early or around 230 .
the service can we say terrible my friend and i waited over an hour for four freakin empanadas so we left that was just ridiculous .
yum i heard they were good but damn it really hit the spot i got the paneer roll fingerlickin spicy good .
the empanadas were terrible super thick dough covering bits of spicy dry meat fruit shake was good decent service nice ambiance for a hole in the wall .
great takeour for lunch whether staying there or taking away its best to call the order ahead so you dont have to wait can be a decent wait during the lunch rush but completely worth it .
good empanadas horrible service .
this is our favorite place amazingly cheap even after being close to time square the food is very good we always have chicken unda roll or shami kabab roll and luv it .
heres why i have to encourage others to go elsewhere the empanadas were pretty good sadly the service turns you off completely the long sliced plantains with the guac was pretty impressive unfortunately its staffed with terrible employees .
brilliant rolls make u feel home away from home i always ask them to make spicy for which they add the freshly chopped green chilly and whoa its amazing great job kati roll company both locations in manhattan .
warm beer horrible service .
i dont even know how to describe this place its simply amazing and you should definitely go here dont even give it a second thought just go and you will be glad that you did .
i been here twice both times i had mussels the first time they were great this time they were full of sand i realize that they cant control the sand but the bread that was served was old too they do have a great selection of beers though .
can i say anything about kati roll co that has not been said before the rolls are greasy and good and they taste better at 3am after you have downed lots of alcohol the chicken tikka roll is to die for the achari paneer is pretty good too .
interesting bar with good beer but the mouse running across the floor was a turn off for me .
this place lived up to expectations once again and thus deserves another star badge on its chest .
beer was warm and food was well below par monks is a far better choice .
good and tasty show up before noon to beat the lunch crowd .
the beer selection is really good but thats about it the place has no atmosphere there was no music the two times ive been there i was on the verge of falling asleep .
just picked up two kati rolls and they were outstanding wife had the potato and i had the beef nice spice to it and service wa excellent abd quick great start to my evening food quest for great and quick food .
eulogy is a fantastic bar with an impressive selection of beers just dont try ordering anything other than beer from the snobs behind the bar they will make it perfectly clear that you are not welcome .
this is by far the best and only kati ive ever eaten the price is too high but my wife and i enjoy sharing the unda beef and unda chicken ask for it spicy .
i tried eulogy again against my better judgment expensive blaisé service uninspired food should have gone somewhere else .
i love these rolls they make the best lunch i am definately coming back nice prices great flavor and so very addicting i think next time ill get 3 .
bottle selection is great but draught variety is somewhat tired service on a monday night was slow but ive had worse unfortunately the place ive had worse service was also eulogy .
very good food i had a shocking experience when i first tried indian food so my friend took me here to redeem my concept i cant recall what did i have but it was very good .
not going to spend much time writing this review go to monks on 16th and spruce more value and quality to be found at monks .
good food but the size of the kati rolls differ day to day i would like them if they would be more consistent .
i enjoy their beer but the service was lame i understand that servers get busy but they were not responsive forgot items and took forever worst of all the lamb made me throw up .
this place is like the new spoon album so damn satisfying ask for extra coriander chutney mmmm .
horrible food period .
i like the village bleecker location better the paneers tofu and chicken are surely better at bleecker though the biryanibiryanicart is amazing their kati rolls are cheaper but no where close to krc everyone including nonindians i have taken to this place have loved the krc rolls .
food is overpriced for the catering like quality mashed potatoes were more salt than potato we sent back the mac and cheese that had a medicinal taste .
decent indian food at a decen tprice .
i had dinner here last night and would not return the service was slow the food was bland and there was this lingering dive bar smell to the restaurant .
great find right in midtown 2 tasty rolls my favs are lamb will make you very happy .
im giving jg a lower rating because they no longer offer the one great dessert they had on the menu beignets and when we reluctanty ordered one of the new desserts brownie they did not have any to provide really .
every time i come in from sf i usually stop here at least once the kati rolls are always very tasty .
this is not joses best i find the menu rather limited i do like the flat breads .
hmmm yum .
i am a huge jg fan this is not one of his best the food came out to fast and the menu did not read well or explain the dishes properly i left hungry and i thought the meats and fish dishes for the portions were completely overpriced .
just go and try their awesome beef tikka roll the bestest indian burrito trust me you will thank me later loooove the vintage amitabh bachchan posters priceless oozing sex appeal lol .
complete cretins zero loyalty to customers spending decent money in this establishment food is alright but people skills are zero for this place never again .
delicious kati rolls one is never enough .
small spot not many places to sit outside the bar is small too not a min for debit cards good happy hours 2 geneesee cream ale beers 5 mixed drinks and select wines small food menu not many veggie options .
they are spicy flavorful and delish the cons are the long lines at lunch and the greasiness which i am not prepared to sacrifice for less flavor the one thing that i would add to their menu is a raita for dipping .
walked in for a drink and the bar was packed bartender was very rude so we walked out not a good idea to be rude to customers when there are so many other options around wont be returning .
great indian fastfood just a block from the ny public library and handy for times square especially love the achar paneer rolls service is friendly and seats usually open pretty quickly .
small spot good cocktails small portions .
yeah i can dig it altho can get a little spicy for me .
review your credit card statement had a 80 57 bill wrote in 12 tip credit card charged 100 57 .
a staple craving for me while they started a trend and a lot of other kati roll joints have cropped up these guys are the first and best a favourite is the achari paneer roll .
was not impressed .
because of ordering it all the time at kati roll i can now say egg and potato in hindi you know just in case im ever asked to do so on a game show or i get stranded in india and i need to feed myself yum .
ramen bar is mediocre at best the food is consistently mediocre .
fast cheap indian what more can you ask for the portions are small yes but that just gives you an excuse to eat more then one .
food was decent but way too pricey further for a quick bowl of ramen the waitress completely forgot about my table and we had to wait 45 minutes i gave it a second try and the same thing happened not coming back here again .
this place is perfect for a late night snack their menu is simple with pictures to avoid any confusion their egg and chicken roll is yummy remember to get extra napkins because it gets messy .
ate here 3 months ago not good scallops and slaw going bad burger tasted like meatloaf on a stale roll drinks cleared before we were done left hungry because my plate went back full .
the food is exceptional loved the variety of the buffet the paneer is heavenly and they serve appetizers and several desserts .
service was too slow food was okay atmosphere was pretty good .
this is my favorite indian restaurant my wife and i love it the owner is extremely nice and it is never overcrowded .
food is hit or miss dont take anyone you are trying to impress with the meal the menu might sound incentive but execution can disappoint even with something simple like a salad .
consistently delicious friendly staff .
this restaurant is terrible full stop .
lunch buffet is great for trying new dishes and selecting your favorite the staff is very friendly and service is great .
just horrible service very uncomfortable hot restaurant and below average food for brunch .
forget about all the other places this is the best indian restaurant ever the service is excellent the food is excellent the owner is the coolest guy ever honestly there is nothing else to say this place is awesome .
ok the staff is a little pushy but the food was ok nothing that wowed me geronimos has better atmosphere and food if you seek spanish flare .
great combination and very flavorful surprisingly i didnt shit myself and the 10 00 buffet lasts till 230 definitely coming back loved it .
save your money overpriced mediocre food that lacks real flavor ceviche is fine if you enjoy tomato soup thin 13 guacamole is even more appalling rethink your choice .
great fresh and reasonable food i havent been here since they remodeled the place but its comfortable and casual food is great and the home made breads are awesome .
bad drinks worse service bar tender rolled his eyes at me ive made the mistake of going back once and i wont make it again also since when does a mojito have sour mix in it fail .
dayum best indian food ive had in nj yet ordered lunch off the menu looked like most everyone else was there for the buffet chicken khorma was really good even the simple rice pilaf was good dal makni very nice kyber pass kebab very good yum .
the jerk was ok nothing special all they do is make it spicy also the staff was snotty .
wow i dont live in nj anymore but i was home visiting family and my parents wanted to order in and i remember jyoti being pretty good i ordered baingan bharta and it was amazing probably the best indian food ive had go and enjoy woo .
terrible smh .
this place the best indian buffet in this area great place to take friends and family to lunch or just a quick lunch on the cheap the food tastes great and the variety is also great .
its embarrassing how bad the service is at this place ill never be back slow rude not knowledgeable about the menu checked every box .
was looking for indian restaurant in the area and was delighted to find this one great atmosphere great food and service recommend .
terrible food decent service i did mention every time to my server and another worker that the food was eh ok and it was merely ignored no probing as to why wouldnt come back .
i wanted to update to say this place is no longer byob which makes me a bit sad never had a bad meal here .
food sucks service sucks very disappointed there are so many better places to spend your money .
sometimes youre slow to get seated once you are seated the service is fast and great the food is always good an amazing mix of spices and flavors .
we ordered a 10 pizza which was essentially some cheese and crap thrown on a tortilla a big quinoa salad which had walnuts that tasted pretty stale and some wings that were mediocre dessert was meh would probably not come back .
hands down the best indian food in north jersey always consistant and delicious food great vegetarian options too staff is always friendly .
great selection of beer at good prices and nice looking restaurant with decent ambiance that said after three dining experiences ill simply direct the reader to the first sentence of this review .
better than any indian restaurant in the area enjoyed the entrees we ordered incluing chicken tikka masala abu gobi daal all great very friendly staff will return .
i was excited when i read about this place opening in queen village i am no longer excited after my experience this evening terrible food and bad attitudes .
i was very surprised to find that this establishment has found the perfect balance between spice and flavor i am definitely pleased .
inoffensive tolerable mall bar very regs atmosphere this neighborhood can do better maroon 5 on the radio solid beer selection but overpriced too many beers in nonpint glasses .
cant say enough good things food was delicious prices were reasonable place was clean friendly staff nice music i love it .
great food but the service is too slow .
slow service but really good food totally worth it got the chicken korma and asked for it to be spicy it was awesome will def go back .
bleh i felt like i was in a chain restaurant from the 90s mediocre food terrible music and decor .
i love this place byob and has a coupon in the entertainment book im craving chicken tikka masala as we speak .
service slow food sucked wouldnt go back .
caveat ive only been the buffet lunches given that i find the food to be wellprepared using notably all fresh ingredients they put on a little extra effort in the friday buffets so if you can choose a day thats the day to go .
nothing spectacular ordered old fashioned and it was sub par did not order food only drinks .
this place is very good they have a very good lunchbuffet selection that changes daily been going there for quite some time they have both vegetarian and meat dishes .
amazing atmosphere and delicious food even though way overpriced for what you get i had the arugula salad and added shrimp for 4 it came with three shrimp also my entire table enjoyed the cocktails but we were never offered a second drink odd .
fantastic dishesvery spicy the best ive had outside of los angeles .
service was sooooo unhelpful that we left without ordering not a good way to conduct business go to las bugambilias instead .
such a cozy and welcoming place outstanding customer service and very affordable in 2 hours i spent 15 including tip on 3 blue moons and a delicious pretzel thats a steal if you ask any nyc resident definitely will come here again .
hadnt been here for awhile has gone downhill a bit tortilla soup was good steak needed salt impossible cake was awesome though rationing the quac and there were a lot of other apologies happening around the dining room credit card reader was broken food b but experience cc .
i love this place .
their reservation policy sucks ive been to this restaurant twice for a birthday dinner we made our reservations for 9 and we didnt get seated til 10 and their food especially the grouper with mango salsafailed .
came here for a graduation party and had a huge room with a dance floor the food was great our beer mugs and wine were constantly refilled i would love to come here just to grab a beer but i really enjoyed my time here .
granted i havent been here since 2006 but of maybe ten visits over the years i dont recall eating anything particularly tasty vegetarian options were slim and the sangria wasnt very good the nachos obligatorios were hilarious i hope thats still on the menu .
thai tacos are a must have they arent your average tacos obviously but man they are good the decor is cozy and the staff attentive good food for good price .
food was unspectacular and overpriced and left me throwing up the entire night .
best thai ive found in belleville and really in the states so far mamas food is awesome the vibe is relaxed and theres a liquor store next to it for byo .
subpar service is horrible chips are stale food lacks spice the space is nice if youre going for ambiance but dont expect much beyond fyi drinks are weak stick to sangriawineetc .
awesome place amazing food and great service food is yummy and served super hot its byob and theres a liquor store near by on friday nights it gets pretty crowded so just be patient the food is worth it .
nothing special pros the food is okay the space is large and accommodating cons it just isnt great nothing to rave about .
best thai food place in jersey the food was great but customer service needs bit more work if you go there you must try the thai tea im hooked i will be going back to topaz again soon .
the wine was bad and the portions were small disappointing .
first time and we r hooked this is now our favorite thai joint and we know thai mama the best and most gracious host we r starting adoption papers thank u mama .
pretty decent food but such bad service not just from one waitress but across the board .
omgeeeee finally a thai restaurant close by that i love the pad thai was great and the side salad was a nice surprise not expensive either would recommend to anyone looking for authentic thai food .
horrible place ignored by waiter food was cold burger was raw salad dressing was bland and they were out of the good bread only good thing were the fries never coming back .
enjoyable in ways you didnt think food could be vegetables and tofu done right authentic creative and tasty place .
drinks are not bad but the food is subpar for nyc they messed up on order and food quality was ok i will come here again since so many more better choices prices are high in line with nyc but food is not i .
great food just not consistent still worth going there for some food with good flavors .
got brunch here place seems it would be much better than it is all food was average at best .
my all time favorite thai food place a very warm restaurant with a feel good ambience most weekends we end up dining here my favorite of all is their mushroom puffs n volcano crispy tofu their salad dressings are the best .
the food was good but wow the service was absolutely terrible we waited 20 minutes for someone to take our drinks order and they only did because we begged them too .
still love this place now i know the super friendly woman is mama their pumpkin soup is amazing i cant wait for fall next year .
this place sucks the food needs work the mussels were plenty some type of tasty mac n cheese definitely needs more cheese only two stars for their decor sorry you just gotta try harder next time .
first time here with my fiancé and i must say that between the service and the food the place is amazing .
this place is great for business lunches fast service and somewhat ok food i would keep it simple order a sandwich and talk business food is not that great .
amazing staff delicious food and great atmosphere could do as a first date spot or a casual quiet dinner with your loved ones or friends will be returning there very soon .
dont order the skate did my bf wrong ill leave it at that .
good food and great service we will definitely come back esp for the soft shell crabs yummy .
one free dessert does not equal two mice and two mice in one night is not bueno thats right ya jerks two mice one night .
this is my new favorite thai place the thai coffee is out of this world everything weve ordered from here has been good friendly service and cute ambience .
i came here for brunch last year and it was really good came again a couple weeks ago and was really disappointed its still fine for an average brunch i just found the food to be way too salty they have interesting choices but the execution falls short .
great i gauge thai restaurants by their crispy duck salad ill be back for this one and to try the volcano chicken great service as well .
went here for drinks so i dont about the food the decor is great so is the atmosphere .
great kid friendly place the service is quick and the food is easily some of the best in jersey .
yuk worst chinese food i have ever had it was so so so salty unflavorful just terrible the sesame chicken was like chunks of dried sponge .
i love this restaurant wait staff is friendly and mama always makes you feel at home its cozy and inviting and the food is always delicious sometimes weekends are crowded so be sure to make a reservation and byob .
the last time we here was the worst service we ever have this petite lady is just the worst server ever the food still same its really good but service is getting soooooo bad the food still good .
i have been coming here since it opened and was struggling the food but more importantly momma and her wonderful personality has kept me coming back the best thai in north jersey bar none everything is exceptional prices are reasonable and byob makes it that much better .
service was slow meal was very good but then had to wait 20 minutes for waiter to bring out bill wife waited in the care with toddler and wanted to know why i did not come out we wont be back .
i love it when restaurants are welcoming and make you feel at home mama exceeds in this the seasonal pumpkin curry is great and you cant go wrong with the red curry my only complaint is the corking fee for wine that needs to go .
the worst service weve ever had first time ever and we are not planning on coming back food cost too much not even worth it really bad .
seriously this place is amazing curry pork special absurd mussels in lemongrass white wine broth best ive ever had please open a restaurant in jersey city mama .
i wasnt overly impressed i came here for lunch one day and ordered a vegetarian special it really wasnt very memorable the one thing i do recall is that the soup i ordered was so salty i thought my eyes would drop out .
nice casual thai restaurant pad thai was just right would go back reasonably priced decent food and quick service .
we ordered the lamb tagine fatty bits wasnt fresh and the kofta kebab made much earlier not even hot portions are tiny over priced considering the quality and quantity were not going back there .
the best thai around you simply wont find another place to beat the prices and hospitality that you get at mamas please try the thai tacos and the spicy basil noodles .
2 words very overpriced .
love this place the service is great the food is amazing try the thai tacos yummm .
screw this place its over priced for food that is not tha t good in quality they also treated the girls who worked there like slaves and like they were worthless do not go here moes is two doors down and so much more worth it .
fantastic thai best i have eaten anywhere in the world only 4 stars because the decor is a bit casual but food and service if 5 stars when i go i always order a few extra dishes to have the next day or two .
the chicken was coated in a terribly thick batter that was lacking both spice and salt the service was extremely slow even though only a few patrons were dining the only bright side of our meal was the mac and cheese which was delicious and a good portion .
highly recommend the fish tacos and the volcano chicken friendly staff and good prices usually there isnt a long wait for the food to come out but its been hit or miss .
way overrated i had the british breakfast and ordered with poached eggs the eggs had a strong taste of vinegar the sausages were cold the beans were also cold and the mushrooms were soggy i liked the bread however which was fresh and had a nice crust .
omg this is the best food i have ever had tell them i said hi i will be back .
slow slow service only 3 small groups and it still took an 1hr to get our food plus food was barely edible i wont be back .
mama will steer you right and runs a tight ship the chili sauce is great on everything soft shell craps in season we especially love the ribs and the chicken tacos .
terrible food stay away .
was here again and it was great again noodle dishes and green curry are very good green curry is very spicy yummy worth the trip .
the service was some of the worst service ive ever received in new york city the staff was condescending and rude .
tried the topaz fried rice this time and it did not disappoint me had the fried oreo with ice cream for dessert .
the place is great but somehow my credit card information was used after i left my card here a few hours too long so if you go here dont start a tab at the bar .
my family and i love this place they have great authentic thai food i love their tom yum soup and everything i eat there the prices are extremely reasonable and the people are very friendly we eat here at least once a week .
went in on sunday morning at 10 40am and it was empty door was open and nobody inside either side of the bar very odd was really looking forward to brunch here too .
totally loved loved loved the food great authentic flavors in the comfort if what feels like mamas dining room no frills just good fresh fair definitely will return .
a quiet cool atmosphere save a few rowdy people by the front of the bar delicious cocktail note the singularity though because they unapologetically ran out of the ingredients for everything but that one damn tequila drink makes me think this place is poorly run and aptly named .
amazing place great food great prices great owner this place will never disappoint you the thai food is the best in new jersey .
please do not go here i was there with a party on the superbowl and was slipped ghb worst night of my life .
ordered out yesterday and had the chicken panang curry words cannot describe the awesomeness of that dish ive been going to topaz for the past 4 years never disappointed place is clean atmosphere is really friendly your always greeted with a smile and feel very much at home .
this restaurant is one of the reasons that i dislike chains burgers are greasy not juicy greasy decent salad bar not dazzling decent will not be back .
i have to upgrade my review one of the other reviews said to go with the specials of the night i totally agree yum i am glad this place is nearby .
cant speak to the food but the service at the bar might be the slowest ive ever seen also 14 for makers mark is this a club left to go elsewhere .
came here for lunch with colleagues it was a quiet afternoon the service was good the thai tacos were great i also ordered the green curry with beef very delicious and spicy all in all it was a great meal would definitely come back and try some specials .
terrible service mediocre food over priced to name a few atmosphere was really the only positive thing i can take from this dining experience save your money dine elsewhere .
my favorite thai restaurant in nj cant go wrong with anything on the menu food is always spectacular service is usually good but can get a bit delayed when it gets busy suggest reservation on friday and saturday evening its byob so bring your favorite wine or beer .
pathetic do not go for the reasons mentioned in other reviews like horrible service and bad quality of food and drinks besides price is high for almost everything appearance can be deceptive and this is perfect example .
great food great people this is a five star joint .
good food horrible horrible service the guy gave me a wrong order but was really rude about it service was extremely unprofessional i and future customers will greatly appreciate it if you improve on your service .
i was just there and had the duck which is there signature dish it was awsome the service was great and the other dishes we order were equally as good .
the food is ok but the delivery is constantly late it happened 3 times in 10 days and there was a one and half hour delay once .
topaz is hands down the best thai place i have been to in new jersey area i have been coming to this restaurant for years and tastes so authentic and very well priced i def recommend on trying this restaurant .
food was ok but not the meal my husband ordered atmosphere ok kids running back forth i guess waiting for food service slow not sure if well be back because i wasnt impressed .
delicious thai food the fried pound cake dessert was delicious our server mamas daughter was very attentive and friendly this place is an amazing value .
this place is the worst slow service rude staff just around a bad experience i will never k go back and i am staying at the hotel next door although it is convenient it is so sucks that i will avoid it at all cost .
topaz or once you get to know it moms has great dishes fresh ingredients and an exuberant and friendly owner .
worst hibachi ive ever been to waited 1 hour before we walked never even got to give a drink order and it was a wednesday night to boot .
just had lunch there great environment and great lunch specials the best curry fried rice that i have had also very good pad see eww .
error with the check they forgot my wifes birthday at desert food was average hibachi chef was entertaining as usual hibachi chefs but wont go back .
this was my first time having thai food and it was very good the place is small but cozy and the service is very friendly they have definitely made a return customer out of me .
music way too loud service was alright at best food was ok .
outstanding flavorful food great friendly service an unforgettably delicious experience best thai food yet .
we sat outside on a beautiful sunday evening the restaurant was busy but not packed it took 30 mins to get a cocktail and the following food service was worse however the food was outstanding .
in the words of homer simpson mmmmmmm drool the food was definitely yummo the lunch portions are big enough that you will probably take some home the wait staff im told its mamas daughter is super duper friendly will i be back oh hell bloody yes i will .
new owners and the food just tastes like any other run of the mill chinese restaurant hopefully this is just the break in phase .
great french toast the whipped cream tasted deliciously homemade and the maple syrup was real pure maple syrup yummm my only complaint is that the portions were really small 2 small pieces of french toast for 12 it was so good that i wish they served more .
the splenda costs 20 cents a packet .
love this spot in our neighborhood sautéed kale is my favorite dish followed by griddle cakes with a side of turkey sausage the vibe is very friendly must try a glass of pinotage wine .
tried to go here on a friday night at 1055 and i was told they were closed even though their hours say 1130pm i probably wont try again .
simply perfection great staff delicious food especially the grits and frittata good environment the southerner .
two words busch league service was slow and poor food was awful wouldnt recommend it and wont be going back .
the food is amazing the owner is very courteous brunch is my favorite but i also love the pies and smoothies being eating donnas food for years very healthy and filling highly recommend .
attempt here is to be a thinking persons olive garden wine list with few exceptions is bottom shelf the bar is typical factory brands and cheap flavored vodka .
hands down the most genuinely nice people working there they were so passionate about their establishment and the food accompanied by it i had a breakfast burrito and my girlfriend had the gumbo soup with a sandwich everything was incredible cant wait to go back .
the environment is very bad and its so noisy that you have to speak aloud to make sure people sitting beside you can hear you and the sundry tomato in the main course smells weird .
great egg and cheese on croissant the place is classy but comfortable i would love to hang out here for a couple hours with a good book theyve got a full brunch menu plus juices and some alcohol the owner is very nice too .
rudest treatment i ever got from a host at a restaurant they need to hire a host with more manners and class .
good food like others have said but i was rather impressed with their grits perfect hard to find good grits kudos great staff attentive and shared the work load seems like a good team recommended .
worst penne a la vodka evar feta cheese blocks .
what a wonderful place the food service and atmosphere were all top notch was able to talk to the owner and compliment her unbelievable biscuits and she is a sweet woman cant help but hope for her and this restaurant to succeed definitely get the grits and gravy .
if the owner was anyone but himself this place might have a chance .
yummy griddle cakes great service and the owner is very sweet will definitely be going back perfect for a quick brunch with friends or a drink while watching the world cupa sports game .
caesar salad was wilted with some brown lettuce pastas were good but light cream sauce is not light at all shrimp scampi was tasty bread ok pear and walnut salad quite good so mixed bag i thought pricey for the quality and quantity .
amazing pancakes and outstanding service i cannot wait to go back .
regular italian fare with signs but good atmosphere there is not much to say regular bologense regular chix par regular salad greens .
nice little coffee shop with wifi and the food is really good and the cook is a sweet heart if i lived closer i would go be there all the time to just relax and get something too eat before i go home im going back for sure .
pretty upset right now ordered the 17 and received smoked chicken instead of prosciutto i feel like you should know your menu before you make the sandwiches secondly as previous reviewers have stated the sandwiches arent paninis as they are served as is .
great ambience great food and very friendly wait staff their brunch menu is a bang for your buck .
taking your life into your own hands when you go there at night and its not because of the food .
excellent service and food the brunch menu has a good variety of choices everything i eat was very fresh .
it only got 2 stars because of the fish tank the pineapple fried rice had no taste what so ever the mongolian beef was just as bad the drinks were ok the place was kind of empty for a saturday night .
i went in here with a friend during saturday brunch we ordered the ham cheese croissant and sausage egg bisquits both were excellent the staff was friendly and attentive a true gem in harlem chocolate lovers try their chocolate wine .
sitting here for 10 minutes and the place i empty no one has come over to the table so we are leaving and this place is on the never return list .
great wine and good service the owner was super friendly .
so im glad they close the raw food at the barbecue that we have to cook but they close the kitchen where they cook until 1130pm seriously .
just had my first brunch here and biscuits are quite possibly the best ive ever had with just a hint of cheddar and i chose the farmers skillet ill be back good crowd too .
horrible simply horrible overpriced and poor quality ive been 3 times and thought the same each time the best advice i can offer you is to stay far away from this place .
had a great brunch their this past sunday salmon cakes and the maple chicken sausage were outstanding prices are good too .
stay the heck away we walked out as the slobby bartender couldnt serve us because he and and his slobby friends couldnt stop talking about how long its been since theyd bathed its a classy joint and all the customers were very well dressed hoping for nice lounge .
delicious soups hearty sandwiches great variety of desserts served in a renovated space showing exposed brick walls pot bellied stove in a spacious comfortable setting eclectic art collection with with soothing music played is a relaxing fun venue for lunch in harlem near ccny we will return .
protip stay away from this horrible place seated at an awkward table in this tasteless restaurant service was incompetent no utensils .
this place is not bad 1 good japanese place in midtown that isnt too expensive surprisingly 2 got the soba good price for good quantity and good quality 3 friends got udon and they loved it too 4 its really cute inside bigger than i expected .
great atmosphere great decor and very nice bartender food looked great and portions were ok but it just didnt taste very good there is definitely better sushi out there .
katsu is very tasty as good as those i had in tokyo veggies soup and rice are refillable services are nice didnt plan to dine here and it totally exceeded my expectation .
bad sushi bland tasting bbq very disappointing .
i really liked their katsu i forgot which one i got but i thought it was great big portions too .
watered down soy sauce destroyed the mediocre taste of the sushi mixing watered down soy sauce with wasabi made a clear mix that tasted terrible place was very noisy reviews written here must be from his very large family .
comfort food for me .
i only give this place 2 starts because service is so bad had to wait 20 minutes for a table everyone runs around like their heads are chopped off with that said the sushi is really good and that is the only reason i put up with everything .
great katsu and curry the cabbage balances out the fried foods the miso is good the array of sauces are enjoyable ive only been for lunch a few times and will continue to come .
the worst mexican food ive ever had in the burrito the chicken still had chicken skin and fat and no flavor the tostitos were burned and gross the enchiladas didnt have much flavor the service was slow i really cant understand why this restaurant got good marks .
first and last meal in ny during my last trip out there the katsu is delicious .
ummmm 10 for pho are you kidding me retarded prices who charges 2 for a can soda outside of sports arenas .
i had been here continuous three days for the dinner when i was traveling nyc because of the meals were great and traditional and i love katsu don soba cabbage salad free refill however if you also travel nyc i would recommend this restaurant y y .
got their classic and chicken sandwich their portions were large the sandwich was unbalanced some bites were just spicy the best thing was the peanut sauce on the summer roll .
i love its miso soup and pork the pork was juicy and delicious and it keep japans fashion of unlimited refill for soup rice and side dishes which is nice .
i went there for the bubble tea and wasnt impressed the boba was soft and sweet but the tea had no flavor i ordered the jasmine green tea and even asked for some more tea flavor because i didnt taste i still didnt taste it .
very thick katsu authentic japanese spot try loin its better than tenderloin miso soup bad good price .
park slope location really great food but they delivered to us last week and then tonight 45 minutes after ordering they call to tell us they wont deliver to us this is ridiculous and terrible business .
i tried their chicken katsu it was the best i have ever tasted its crispy and dissolves in your mouth instantly dont know better words to describe you just have to try it .
the only reason i gave this place 2 stars is because of polish bartender inside was extremely hot staff claimed ac was on the mussels were the worst they only give you one piece of bread at a time better places out there .
wow what a treat for lunch the best miso soup ever loin and fillet was super not a fancy place and service is soso but great price here .
bad food for a high price choose another place there are plenty of other restaurants along the street .
the front gate is very small but when you get inside its a whole different world it very artistic very nice .
pros affordable place to have dinner place is romantic enough for a date located in the quiet part of soho cons food and service is mediocre .
the service is very nice the food is a different japonese food beyond sussi great try the katsu with curry or the katsu bon the menu looks pretty good too not that ill ever know i get cravings for katsu curry and thats what i get .
nice atmosphere and food and wine but waiter is not friendly but surly i would not come back here although the restaurants name is wine and flower i did not see flowers inside the restaurant but dead branches .
best katsu i have ever had strongly recommend the berkshire katsu because its fattier and more juicy the katsu dons and udon bowls are delicious as well one of my favorite places to eat in town .
tried to overcharge us for our mimosa pitcher nice try didnt have crab and the ph of my eggs benedict was probably a 1 2 definitely will not be returning .
outstanding ramen a little on the pricey side .
maybe that was a bad evening but sorry i really did not like my experience there burnt bread the cheese plate was a joke chicken entree was not a chicken paillard but just sliced chicken with a burnt taste not impressed at all .
delicious donkatsu the berskshire is especially tender with the right level of cooking .
come here for the drinks not for the food the drinks are strong and pretty great but the food unfortunately leaves a lot to desire from mexican i suggest sitting at the bar and ordering an interesting guac with some margaritas for the best experience .
very authentic place to get katsu and curry you can smell the curry the minute you walk in and its fabulous will definitely come back for more love their sesame dressing for the cabbage salad it is the same as the dish i had in asia .
overpriced guacamole weak margaritas and always a waiting time of 2 hours dont do it .
had the hire katsudon and it was great i liked that it wasnt overly fancy and just an old fashioned katsudon a bit pricey 14 but would go back if im in the area .
my two stars says it all ive experienced better our visit here was very meh we expected more from a place with such great reviews .
really like the katsu juicy tasty nice thin crunchy crust lovely little place near 5th ave the waitresses are busy so sometimes you may need to wait a little bit longer but all in all would love to go back again .
they get one star only because the drinks are good the service is bad the food is not authentic and the overall attitude is snobby for such a mediocre place why people come here i will never know .
really good food but lacks in customer service curry chicken was good and amounts were big had to ask for water and the check when we were obviously finished wasnt crowded and plenty of wait staff so not sure why .
this place is cool but so mismanaged i hate that it takes an hour just to get a seat a bit corny .
my kind of comfort food great katsu and their oyako donburi is as good as i remember that dish will order their curry katsu next time i am here .
the food was not good so what else can i say .
for katsu in usa i think it is as good as it gets .
i like the atmosphere of el vez but i think the food quality has gone down hill in the past few years in terms of mexican there are many other options in philly that arent as pricey the staffs great and they have nice outside seating .
outstanding worth the plane ticket from sfo to jfk cab to manhattan to eat here th tonkatsu options are stunning kurobuta of any size fried with housemade tonkatsu sauce or curry rice even the fukujinzuke is outstanding not kidding run dont walk there now .
decent food and drinks cannot make up for inexperienced grumpy uninviting staff this place is not for families or for those who value knowledgeable welcoming service with a smile .
nice cozy place staffs are very friendly .
overpriced garbage served in oversized bowls that are most appropriate for dogs to eat out which is what this food should be reserved for dogs .
hot damn fried japanese everything .
ive tried el vez a few times the first time i hated it a few months later i gave it another shot meh 3rd time was meh there wont be a fourth time because there are several other really good spots that i much prefer to el vez .
i dont eat a lot of japanese food so cant write a very critical review the service was great i was a little clueless about how to handle one of the dishes so the staff was happy to enlighten me the food was very good .
it was just a so so place .
for those who do not eat pork this place still is worth a visit my standby dish from having lived in japan is oyako donburi and it is properly done here they recently spruced up the place so the overall experience is now even better .
the manager was the most disrespectable person i have dealt with in philly very disappointing for being a steven starr would not go back because of how our group was treated .
the katsu curry is amazing i go there often for workday lunches and i was never disappointed by their tonkatsu must try place .
bffft .
fav katsu curry in nyc .
the photobooth is cool atmosphere is weird and not welcoming and the drinks werent too great i am not a cocktail girl though so i should stop ordering cocktails .
authentic japanese donkatsu slightly pricey but thats japanese food for you the quality of the meat is excellent they give plenty of cabbage to chase down the grease its a solid four which i give it sparingly which i encourage all yelpers do sayonara ill be back .
good happy hour scene food meh .
pretty decent place cute and warm atmosphere .
food is ok service blows .
very authentic style tonkatsu japanese pork cutlet place there is also another one at 55th between 5th and 6th but this location is actually better in terms of food quality at least the last time i went .
the food was gross the carnitas tacos were dry and had no flavor the enchiladas were nasty the blood orange margaritas were great the guac was fine but nothing to write home about .
obsessed with this place cant wait to go back when its less hot out and the cold weather calls for the down home katsu curry go right at 12 as there usually isnt a wait .
came here twice and was disappointed both times the only thing i would order again here is the guac with jumbo lump crabmeat and thats all but there are so many other authentic mexican eats around philly id rather go to so no more el vez .
i wouldnt say its the best but its pretty solid ive gone a few times with my wife and her friends the food is always consistent there are better places for curry but its not bad here the tonkatsu is what i really go for anyway .
hated it service bad people bad food bad go somewhere else and everything was overpriced .
delicious katsu was in the neighborhood and decided to check this place out sat by the bar and was served immediately fast service good food lunch special was affordable and filling and left satisfied would love to try their donburi lunches next time .
pretty cool atmosphere but food portion laughable for price if its going to be meager portions it better be orgasmic good it wasnt it if i never go back i could live w it .
good quality japanese really 3 5 stars giving it four stars is for the unlimited miso soup with the lunch specials the katsu is perfectly cooked and i always leave full and satisfied .
the margaritas and guacamole were good i would not come here for an actual dinner ive been here twice and never left completely in love or impressed with anything i had .
make sure u order the pork katsu miso soup and cabbage are unlimited refill .
the food was so so and quite expensive flavorwise it is not the most authentic mexican restaurant in town its good for a casual date or drinks with friends more than a real culinary experience .
what a score excellent katsu juicy and delicious good value for a manhattan lunch spot and quick service this reminded me of the little hole in the wall japanese places in gardena ca id definitely recommend it .
horrible cheezy overcrowded overrated typical of this type of establishment .
have had katsu before but this is one of the best places in nyc ordered the prefixe chicken katsu dinner loved the katsu and the free refills of rice cabbage salad miso soup loved the sesame seeds and grinder will be back japanese sangria was a tasty bonus .
overpriced and with a clubby crowd that i find uninteresting el ray better suits me .
all their katsu .
overpriced mexican food served in a hip center city atmosphere no chipssalsa with your order other than that its normal mexican food .
great quality and fair prices .
i like the location the drinks were okay but the service was slow it is always busy there so people like it the bar is way too close to the tables there so its very uncomfortable .
great service delicious food i loved the interactive eating too grinding my own sesame was fun .
i know so many people love el vez and ive only been once just dont understand what all the hype is all about the place looks nice the noise level is high and the food was ok maybe i was there on an off night .
osewaninattemasu .
pretty good food and drinks but way overpriced .
i always liked this place cause it has katsu and a lot of different kind .
another overrated place food was overly cilantroed open table reservations wouldnt allow for a table reservation we sat at the bar there were at least 6 empty tables for our entire visit ridiculous and 88 later i feel cheated .
my first meeting with katsu i had the pork katsu with grated radish and ponzo sauce oroshi kurobuta loin katsu 24 i loved the miso soup the katsu and especially the citrusy soy sauce ponzo sidenote i heard the place also had quite good vegan food .
the guacamole and the drinks are great the decor is fun but the food is terribly seasoned and the service is only soso the tacos were doused with so many seasonings i could barely tell what i was eating .
this is good solid japanese restaurant food was good service was good also .
overpriced underwhelming not the best of star restaurants .
love the fact that they are specializing in katsu dishes tried the lunch special combo which included curry udon love it so worth the price .
way too expensive and overrated if youre inclined to eat at a steven starr i recommend continental for happy hour .
always busy and always good had the luch box limited number to be served special for 18 more food than i needed and everything fresh delicious and not oily hve been coming here for over 5 years and never disappointed .
eh ok food and drinks .
best katsu don in ny pork cutlet is juicy .
on my last visit i noticed that one of their guacamole offerings is named for cesar chavez which is great because all cesar chavez wanted out of life is to have some guacamole named in his honor .
this place is awesome you know when the place is full of japanese people you are in the right spot the katsu is amazing the curry katsu is even better you can eat a ton here for dinner and not pay too much pitchers of beer too .
have a few drinks enjoy the vibe but skip the overpriced blah food i cant believe they even messed up churros i mean come on guys .
really delicious authentic japanese home cooking the pork and chicken katsu are really great .
long wait and slow service on a wednesday evening the worst fish tacos i have ever had good guacamole reason for two stars will i come back here no .
great affordable japanese food love the katsudon special there are multiple ones on offer as well as their appetizers definitely recommended .
the service was awful but the food was okay my boyfriend thought that the enchilada sauce tasted like chef boyardee i could see that it wasnt impressive by any means the presentation of the food was amazing but the taste was in the middle .
the katsu and the pork soup strongly recommend were awesome despite the fact that they made me wait for my check for quite a time .
i think my mistake with this place is that i always seem to go around happy hourthe worst time ever to go the drinks are good and the food seems okay but everything here everything is waaay overpriced .
very nice katsudon and the takeaway counter had room for a stroller to boot .
not a fan hate the whole enviroment gimicky like all starr spots expensive not for me .
holy delicious the katsu don was exquisite every bit as good as any time i had the dish in japan they lose a quarter star for not having sriracha but i cut em some slack reasonably priced for the area too .
tried this place one more time to give them another shot never again this time was given raw chicken in my panini when i called to let them know not one person apologized really poor customer service an apology goes a long way .
best tonkatsu in ny so far but i never got good service here .
being from brooklyn this pizza is no way close of tasting anything like the slices in brooklyn for jersey i guess its ok not the best had worse .
decent place for some moderately priced katsu nice to have in the neighborhood .
ive been meaning to come to this place for a long time so i recently had the chance the pizza isnt awful its just reminiscent of frozen pizza from the supermarket not worth going at all .
great katsu make your own sesame sauce and get beer with the food so much better .
the pizza crust was bordering on cardboard territory mozzarella sticks were no better than frozen its a chain from florida or something has anyone ever been to florida their pizza is terrible stick to 100 other small pizza parlors in the area for something better .
delicious katsu the pork was especially good quick and friendly service highly recommend .
it is one of the worst pizza i tried out of brooklyn the pizza is greasy and wings are tasteless the best thing on the menu is the coke .
tonkatsu curry some of the best japanese comfort food ever food is absolutely delicious especially washed down with a cold beer gigantic portions at a decent price .
would not recommend their food is not fresh went here twice and both times got sick their sushi gave me gastroenteritis not something you want to go through .
best katsu place in nyc .
fussy and unsatisfying dishes entrees such as the lamb roast or squid are overtaken by too many competing garnishes sometimes a slice of cheese and apple are all you need .
an authentic eating experience had the chicken katsu not terribly awesome but the staff and interior were nice .
every yelp review mentions the rabbit yet it seems they have removed it from the menu as of at least september 2015 total letdown everything else was relatively overpriced and mediocre tasting throw in some snotty service and you get yourself a 2 star review .
i go here again and again when i travel to nyc delicious japanese katsu at a fair price ive had the pork and tried the chicken with curry sauce both were very delicious great cure for a hangover .
this place is a joke they sat us down and didnt take our order for 40 minutes they food we got was tiny and boring im posting the photo of their pastries plate that will say it better than words .
love this place for their tonkatsu the waitress was nice and they refilled my plate with cabbage miso soup and rice a few times with no extra charge the katsudon was good also .
the food is too damn small .
oh man the chicken katsu curry is freakin awesome make sure to put the hot spices in there as it really adds a good kick to the dish .
quality of food is high what they serve is tasteful and drink selection is vast but its a stretch of the term to call this a tapas bar unless bar takes priority dont come here expecting calories to come from food fir 80 of the menu us alcohol .
had their kurobuta katsudon very good i saw someone having a katsu curry that looked really good must return before i leave ny in a few days .
what happened to you when you first opened you were fantastic i went back today and i was sooooooooo disappointed food didnt look fresh empanadas lacked filling and the filling was horrible im so upset at this place it had huge potential but instead fell off .
katsuhama offers pretty reliable authentic katsu dishes for when you want katsu i like how they provide the pestle and mortar for your freshly ground sesame seed needs as well as a heaping mound of chopped cabbage just like mom would serve you .
it was cheap guess you get what you pay for gave me the worst diarrhea of my life think i rather pay more and go to one of the better chinese restaurants in wayne for dinner from now on .
15 dollars for a pitcher is not bad near times square i got the katsu and it was the best i have had outside of so cal the prices were affordable by nyc standards if i stay around the area i will def be back .
awful first portion is sad almost 5 00 for a flavorless mac and cheese come on the portion was smaller than what you get in the kraft microwave cups spent over 10 00 and could have gone to 10 other places and got twice the food .
brilliant katsu set with the works and some tempura as well this place is midpriced but well worth every cent as the katsu is done just right and the curry sauce is not too salty .
was not impressed we had one back home in the midwest that was much better out of our 3 meals only the kids mac and cheese was good the other 2 were dry dry dry .
love the pork curry with unlimited cabbage salad something about it makes it crave it over and over again yum yum and cheap .
we had the pork feast and most of the dishes were too greasy and overly salty the bacon profiterole and malt icecream was delicious .
best tonkatsu i cant find anything like it in los angeles .
very disappointing menu choices and quality definitely did not live up to all the hype i would not return perhaps the people who love it have never had any other french country cuisine .
i am a big fan of this place for lunch and for a casual dinner they know how to fry pork i also enjoy the presentation of the cabbage and sauces the curry is great perfect comfort food for a cold day .
terrible service the hostess was extremely rude and our party of 9 ended up walking out .
i just love this place usually dinner time is pack i recommend that make reservation before you go .
terrible service people very upset with everything when we asked for seating for nine hosts response was well thats ambitious no manager on site and twenty open tables poor planning on their end .
tonkatsu one of my favorite dishes this katsuhama is great because it has sets unlike the one at 55th st or whatever i dont know where else has better katsu in nyc i wish there were though because the level is definitely higher in asia for katsu .
very interesting and unique experience the restaurant has a fairy tale theme going on and i dont know if thats a good thing or bad thing the food was mediocre at best .
katsu curry was awesome and strangely refreshing add some cold kirin ichiban and youre set .
our dinner took way too long to arrive the people sitting at the next table arrived after us and got their food before us we ordered the lamb which was very tasty and the paleo zucchini pasta which unfortunately was very bland probably will not come back again .
the donkatsu lunch special is awesome good portion definitely left feeling satisfied you get your own sesame seeds to grind in a bowl to mix with the sauce very authentic for 11 a great deal dont go for the decor or service .
meh as in mediocre overpriced for yorkville but i guess theyre anticipating when the second avenue subway is up and running which will drive up prices all round .
good katsu japanese style pork cutlet its the same good katsu you can get in japan .
pretty pricey for a lamb kebob pita at 9 50 no seasoning zero flavor had the lamb kebob platter too rice is good but everything really just lacks that special spice and tangy flavor found in this cuisine meh tried them twice doubt there will be a third .
homemade tonkatsu sauce perfect panko perfectly fried not greasy just crispy best tonkatsu i have ever had .
nooo taboonette discontinued the halloumi salad and replaced it with some other version with beets and a vinaigrette that was by far the best thing on the menu really hope they bring it back .
this is place is really good the curry chicken katsu was really yummy miso soup was so so .
i ordered the pull pork and while i was having my first bite i saw a roach on the wall how is this place open so unsanitary disgusting never coming back .
almost like being in japan except for the service staff food is excellent .
fortunately i dont rate foods on authenticity unfortunately i still wouldnt recommend this restaurant to anyone in the middleteranean or elsewhere .
very good and authentic japanese food the katsu is delicious they bring extra rice miso soup cabbage small restaurant but fun to be at .
what terrible service the lady manning the phone is so rude unbelievable they are so late and give you attitude when you ask why the food hasnt arrived 145 hours later .
my favorite tonkatsu place in the city especially with oroshi and the yummy non stop salad they make their own tonkatsu sauce with green apples in it yumms .
halal food truck quality food but half the size and double the price nice interior but no serves nor friendly smile .
of the oddly high amount of asian restaurants in the area this is one of the best the chinese is above average and the sushi is better than expected not mindblowing but good enough and the delivery aspect doesnt hurt in the least .
a place known for its breakfast sandwiches doesnt open until 900 am not even 830 doesnt make sense this would be a 4 or 5 star review otherwise .
the food is absolutely delicious i ordered the orange chicken and it was amazing after coming to manhing i havent gone to any other restaurant for chinese food the taste is authentic and the service is great .
the arm hair i assume arm hair otherwise it would be much more nefarious was not the sort of garnish i was expecting at least that explains why it took them so long to prepare .
i can describe appetizzios in one word excellent and the staff could not be nicer the only bad thing is parking i wish they would move to another area in lyndhurst the lack of parking has to effect their business .
not good experience i have just got a simple salad and a calamari and the veggie seemed not to be freh and healthy at all if this should represent the italian food abroad i am not proud to be italian .
love this place the sandwiches are phenomenal the pasta salad is to die for theres always the two guys that work there and they are very nice i would highly recommend .
wonderful food worst waiter ever totally ignored us once he took our order acted like he did us a big favor noticed lots of friction between him and the lovely waitress who would have made our experience a keeper he needs to go .
delicious inexpensive and quick service deli italian sub was ohsotasty street parking subtracts one star and would have been nice to have a chair or two so i didnt have to enjoy that sandwich in my car but otherwise absolutely no complaints .
this restaurant gave me food poisoning spinach lasagna will never go back avoid .
excellent they make a sub so good u think about the next one u will order the store is very clean and smells good .
i waited 10 years before giving chilis a second try i think ill wait another 10 years before another the steak was soso and the mashed potatoes tasted like cold wall paper paste .
i love this place i have gone almost every friday because i work in lyndhurst on fridays i have not had anything that is bad this guys are awesome and so accepting and will make anything you want .
too expensive for what it is the 17 vegetable risotto is made from those frozen vegetables in a bag cubed carrots peas etc with no fresh vegetables at all small portions too disappointing .
must stop here fresh mozzarella made at least 3x a day sandwiches big enough for 2 everything is fresh and reasonably priced my boyfriend lives 2 blocks away and i am no longer upset he moved from ct .
i wanted to like this place but it is just terrible dont waste your time or your money .
the best italian deli around staff is great food is even better .
i cant quite figure out why people go to this place overpriced stingy portions lousy service so so food etc nearby dosai place or cakewalk is so much better .
this is the best italian deli i think i have ever been too the owner and staf are super friendly and even gave me some free garlic bread everything i have had from there is incredible the mozzarella is great and the coldcuts are top notch .
bummer food okay to meh everything everything is fried nothing is filling or feels healthy service not great no ice on the premises for your water cheap but you get what you pay for never again .
some of the best sandwichs in town really like the meatball pam .
horrible food and service asked for a crispy dosa it was anything but crispy the dosai place down the road is much better they also got the check wrong .
my favorite pizza joint cash only huge portions and worth every penny my husband and i have been coming here since we were kids the best .
uncooked paneer appetizers biryani white rice mixed into older biryani masala trying to cover up stale food into too much spice im so glad we have other options in parsippany now .
love joes great pie nice service .
really bad i could taste nothing but the chillies plus my order was mixed up nothing to recommend other than the price .
the tiramisu and espresso were on point also the bartender and hostowner were really generous about letting us grab dessert right when they were about to close cant wait to eat an entire dinner always packed on the weekend make sure to make a reservation and bring cash .
a small portion of chicken biryani for 12 what a ripoff the paradise outlets at other locations including edison and jersey city offer much bigger portions and better value for money .
my husband and i usually get take out from here once a month the kale salad is delicious and sometimes at night i dream of the sage gnocchi .
service very disappointing with long waits and indifferent attention .
great food and great service .
just so so wanna simple much during weekend its can be considered but never worth for line up .
love this place the food is consistently good the fish special is usually my go to the calamari is always pleasing too this place is super intimate which i love when the weather permits its also a nice place to grab a bite outside .
multiple friends have been to this restaurant but totally do not recommend here for the same reason the service was not good but request more than 18 tip for parties of two kind of humiliating customer .
cant fault this spot get the tiramisu got the lamb tagliatelle green salad calamari fritters and tiramisu cozy and close to home .
food is ok they pay too much attention on the tips i gave them 18 for dinner and they are not satisfied with that want me to pay more tips i wont go there anymore .
i love this place great fresh food homemade pasta i cant even list my favorite because i love them all the staff is so nice and it goes well with the awesome food i know i repeat myself but the food really is great .
i dont think it is a good place to go cant even find food to make us full .
the only downside to this place is that it is cash only truly amazing lamb tagliatelle great calamari with delicious spicy marinara sauce great house wines and everything is an amazing value especially for nyc the restaurant is very cute has great lighting and an outdoor dining option .
we came here for lunch the other day and got premium beef shabu lunch special very standard beef and sauce nothing special pricey for such mediocre lunch special .
you simply cant do better at this price range great ambiance too .
maybe we all ordered the wrong thing but the beef shabushabu was nothing special at all .
the piadina were warm and comforting the pasta too was proportionally perfect and the wine selection was ideal for a menu this size and price range its a wonderful neighborhood staple to enjoying a night out whether or not it is a special occasion .
the food was okay but was brought down by the terrible service i had im sure others had better experience but i didnt 2 stars .
great local restaurant good price human sized portions their carbonara was fantastic but unfortunately is no longer featured on the menu they do have it sometimes as a special friendly service cash only wish they had sgroppino on the menu hope they check their yelp .
definitely over priced and over rated ive had much better shabu once is plently for me .
overall a good experience the food was tasty if a bit heavy for summer staff was friendly i just wish the decoration was a little fresher but thats just me being nitpicky .
over over overpriced totally no idea why this place is rated so high on yelp and the hot sauce is actually pretty sweet even the chili powder u call that spicy even red brick powder is spicier .
the food here is very good great portions at a very reasonable price service is lacking but understandable in such a small dining space great addition to the neighborhood a must .
although the food looks good i am bummed this place has a two order minimum i am a shabu fan but it doesnt work for single travelers .
great food wine and service it is cash only but it wont break the bank its pretty tiny so you may want to call ahead and make a reservation because it fills up fast .
this was my first experience with shabu shabu it was ok not something that i would try again the waitstaff was very attentive and very thorough in explaining the process to me .
during our visit to brooklyn we discovered this place because of yelp we sat outside on a lovely summer night and had the best food im a fan of any place where i can get glutenfree pasta .
worse triple d spot ive encountered service was great but food lacked any quality i got the buffalo chicken sandwich the chicken was really thin and very dry i subbed out onion rings for fries good choice girls watch out my girlfriend said the bathroom was horrible .
awesome value the chef is incredible generous with portions and even offer delivery i frequent as much as i can .
someone please tell me how this place ended up on ddd i cant think of one good thing to say about this place i had chipped beef on toast and got a couple of slices of corned beef in a bowl of cream soup .
cute lil place around the corner from my house mussels is a must try fresh pasta and the service is always great .
nice enough place really nothing special though at least at breakfast inexpensive bland bagel for an upcharge at breakfast was awful however there is no excuse for bad bagels in this part of the country .
i live just down the street and have been here around 6 or 7 times already it is pretty damn good and ridiculously cheap the specials are actually special lamb ragu branzino wild boar ragu spinach tagliatele with peas and prosciutto amazing .
here is a review of their reservation process bad experience i guess the rude behavior extends beyond those who eat there please tell your folks to be more polite on the phone even if you dont have an available slot no need to be rude about it thanks .
great the prices are amazing and the food delicious our waiter was friendly and attentive i loved the shaved brussels sprout salad i would definitely go here again .
the place is nice specially in the summer the music is good but the service is terrible the bartenders take at least 15 minutes before they even acknowledge you specially if you are a female you will have no luck with getting a drink horrible service .
enjoyed it a lot very personal service great food nice neighborhood joint .
first time there will never return not a place i would recommend to anyone service and parking fees not good lil blonde girl behind bar needs to go back to bartender school .
neighborhood gem insanely high quality food for the price great service its still byobbyow until they get their liquor license .
this place was not very clean inside and the waitress was slow and also their food just taste okay .
great tapas restaurant it is a bit pricey but you definitely pay for the quality and craftsmanship of the food i would recommend this to people who enjoy a good variety of food andor want a nice place to take a date .
everything looks premade cold cuts all pre cut piled all over the place walked out .
giving fives stars because we loved everything the dishes we had sea bass abondigas shrimp brussel sprouts fantastic string beans rice great spanish wine list great service enjoyed sitting downstairs in the more quiet area upstairs was very crowed and loud .
ive gone here twice only to find it closed both times their hours dont match up with what is on yelp and nothing is posted on the store front and the phone number goes to nowhere booo .
excellent ambiance fantastic bar and an accommodating staff the menu was eclectic and the service was attentive i cant wait to go back .
the most expensive sandwiches around and that includes manhattan 10 for a half sub the quantities are huge but pretty flavorless and dont forget to bring 2 00 for a cup of deli coffee nothing special more a myth than a legend .
very cool decor and great dinner spot the food is very rich and filling the 3 plates per person is more than enough highly recommend the sea bass .
caveat im a vegetarian so take that with a grain of salt but had the fried eggplant sandwich there it was cold oily and just mushy prolly for the true deli cut eaters a mecca but not so much for vegetarians .
had the charcuterie arugula salad figs wrapped in serrano crispy potatoes lamb chops pork loin and brussel sprouts superb .
service was a bit on the slow side despite not being very busy 14 dollar burger was incorrectly cooked both tries ordered medium rare and got a hockey puck my friends bizarre fish and pasta dish was rather tasteless wouldnt go back again .
went for restaurant week i cant remember the specifics of what we had but the problem was that there was so much pork i have to admit there was plenty more to fill you up and everything was great the ambiance is really nice too .
great beers great bartender worst burger ever asked for pink was dry like a camel they offered to replace but the original order took way too long again bar staff was great .
all i have to say is im glad my girlfriend had a bellyache before we went because i ate 130 00 worth of food that was all perfect staff was extremely knowledgable and brought our plates out with perfect timing loved it .
no the fuck thank you ive been here twice and have had horrible dining experiences the food was appalling and my drinks were damn near 200 proof i would never suggest this joint to anyone unless they want to have a shitty ass night .
began a wonderful evening with drinks by nick at the bar moved on to a delicious meal tastefully prepared and beautifully presented sat downstairs which was quiet and intimate loved it food was great some of best tasting dishes we ever had service was incredible thank you .
terrible service asked for water four times before i got it never brought out an iced tea that was ordered the food was good though .
i agree with another yelper that this is one of garces best restaurants we dined out here to celebrate a friends recent move to center city and the food and serve was perfect .
terrible not what it used to be vomit in the bathroom was not cleaned up for over an hour thats not what i paid good money for i will never go back .
one of the best meals weve had in the city we went with our servers recommendations and were very happy pulpo albondigas short rib pork belly well be back .
the beer was quite nice the food was not .
first time in philadelphia and this restaurant is just what i was looking for very cool interior .
awful food one step one very very small step up from mcdonalds too bad the space is fantastic and the beer is quite good my recommendation warm up with a few tasty local brews and head to bin 228 dish or even vaughns for a better meal .
heaven .
the food just wasnt good there were three of us and all had the same reaction the ingredients did not seem fresh tasted like fast food on real plates service was so so .
a little pricey but good food .
meh not for the price .
great food good wine list and attentive service .
below average but then what would you expect in a dump like hartford .
one of my favorite spots diver scallops organic chicken bomba rice i think thats what its called are singer of my favorites .
as far as hot dog go its long on history and short on taste hanks franks or weiner house are much better option if you want to eat a hotdog and you dont have to put up with the bullshit attitude .
great service and very good food my only knock is the price but its a very solid option i would go back .
stopped hear for a couple of dogs they were ok the buns were stale the onion rings needed seasoning would stopp again only if i was in the area .
delicious ive been to tinto a few times and never disappointed the mustorder dishes are the pork belly duck confit and short rib sandwich yum .
what a dump loool how did they get so many reviews definitely turned off right now .
tapas are very good here but the food is a tad salty we usually get the tasting menu with wine pairing a big fan of the duck confit with black cherry mussels string beans and olives good for groups too .
have no idea what all the rage is about this place sucks its dirty portions are tinny and the dogs are small n tasteless get a grip .
great food great wine great atmosphere perfect spot for a date 45 dishes are more than enough for a party of two some of my favorites are chicken brochetas meatballs duck .
terrible service they slam food on table when its served fries are done in very dirty oil they look burnt place needs to be updated .
the tapas were spectacular tasted healthy and unique the pulpo was phenomenal ambiance was also great the spot is located near village whiskey and seem hidden however the atmosphere inside was quite amazing and service was also great .
this place is a dump if you want good hour dogs in a place that is clean go to hot grill also in clifton .
the food was prepared exquisitely .
rutts hut hot grill whats the difference im hirams guy and that is that .
yes yum and i love you i highly recommend the chef tasting arrive hungry we also loved the chestnut soup and duck canapés excellent wine list great service decor and atmosphere the best jose graces restaurant in philly .
if you want an average at best hot dog then this is your place nothing special at all just a grilled hot dog on a bun the relish is why it gets one star huge disappointment .
bill great service great food great wine definitely will be back whenever we are in philly sit at the bar and drink with bill .
terrible over done dog condiments are horrible staff was rude do not take visitors there not impressed .
went last night after working brunch and shopping had the arugula salad and then the mussels and had the picos fruit forward red all were absolutely delightful service was just right and of course the atmosphere is beautiful .
grossly overrated horrid dirty dude behind counter filthy place and just an awful place the dog was mediocre at best dog cart near me is way better it is a dive i dont get the greatness of this legendary place .
very similar to amada portions and service were just right great for foodies and groups dishes are meant to be shared with your party i think it is enjoyable that way instead of ordering separate dishes .
im still pissed i wasted my time driving to rh for some hot dogs with an almost mythical status the hot dogs are nothing speci they have a cheap taste and again nothing special this place sucks .
great food great service walked in after a comedy show down the street for my sisters 21st birthday it was absolutely wonderful .
ripped into a ripper then tossed the rest one bite revealed that the deep fryer turned the skin into a thick paper feeling texture another bite reaffirmed it next into the trash .
we had the private room for my 30th birthday and it couldnt have been nicer we had a great time service and the food was incredible .
i feel like its never been cleaned i understand its history and the ordering attitude much like pats in phlil but pats pulls it off where rutts just comes across very dbag like if you will .
best tapas restaurant ive ever experienced did the deluxe tasting menu and did not regret it best for a big group of not picky eaters .
gross i imagine deep fried alpo would taste the same .
enchanting mesmeric bartenders orgasmic food good wine .
if you have the nerve to actually go in after seeing the outside it doesnt get much better there was garbage all over the parking lot and along the building it looked like a dump the hot dog deep fried a ripper was exactly that and nothing more .
eaten there loads great food only drawback is tables are close and it can get noisy .
overrated the hot dogs taste weird not because of how they are prepared they are just strange hey taste like tofu dogs not worth the trip .
excellent atmosphere and service each plate was outstanding try the lobster dish it burst with flavor but not overbearing also the rice dish is soooo good great for a romantic night with your favorite person or cool place for friends .
just my opinion no .
its a tapas place their plates might be small but the food tastes amazing the lamb is a must try i love the duck sea bass figs as well .
didnt like this place felt like a truck stop felt very uncomfortable here food tasted like it was all frozen tried it but never again .
im a huge fan i came here with my boyfriend and we both ordered the chefs tasting menu there was way too much food but i was happy with every dish i would definitely come back again for a date .
food wise its delicious service wise just awful time and time again weve ordered delivery and takes them 1 5 hours to deliver it 1 mile but its delicious so im torn but this is just ridiculous now .
went to tinto for some tapas on a friday night we had a reservation and were promptly seated atmosphere very relaxing and comfortable servers were very friendly dishes were just perfect and nicely presented recommended .
food was pretty good but the woman serving and making all the food decides the price of your meal based on her own criteria that has nothing to do with the listed price on the menu seemed sketchy and would like to charged the correct amount .
beautiful presentations gazpacho was flavorful the pork belly and duck were perfectly prepared the sea bass and pulpo delicious the desserts delicious .
pretty classic example of an overpriced restaurant 35 for an entree of good but not great food pretentious farm to table yuppie bs in my humble opinion .
we both had the food tasting and wine pairing they were both excellent with new tastes and textures we appreciated the opportunity to explore some very interesting and flavorful wines .
went back with my husband for our anniversary food not so good service not so good not a great experience what a disappointment after such a fabulous first experience .
tinto is really one of the best tapas restaurant in philadelphia their food which occasionally changes is spot on the only reason they didnt get a five is that im not a big fan of their desserts .
ill keep it simple service poor food uninteresting value way over priced sad thing is that i had bookmarked the restaurant almost 6 months prior heard lots of great reviews but fell way short of expectations next .
pricey but delicious .
what i really think of hearth and pictures to prove their audacity in serving up 1 wilted lettuces drowning in cheap dressing 12 and 2 days old chunks of swordfish 32 cubes fit for making left over fish stew soledadbleuetoile blog… .
great food again just too much food amazingly as we left my wife said one less fish and something with artichokes that was what we said the last time we went .
overrated good locally sourced ingredients classic cuisine but nothing exciting flavorwise very limited menu overall ok if it was priced at ive experienced better 2 5 stars .
great small plates the duck confit was pretty delicious .
it feels like sf food but not as good i like the concept but it wasnt very good the famous gnocchi was too salty for me .
very good tapas and good selection we loved the octopus .
bad customer service i found a foot long hair in my entree when i brought it to their attention they offered to take it away and thats it the weird part is that they didnt really care .
amazing food friendly service good vibes .
the food was over priced for the taste .
weve dined here a number of times and always left amazed the food is amazing drink list delicious and service second to none .
terrible i have no idea why there are good reviews doughy pizza that was under cooked wheres dat good cripsy pizza at .
first visit nice menu something for everyone good wine list .
do not use the delivery service i waited for 2 hours calling every 15 minutes after the 60 minute expected delivery time i got the same excuses and never received my food it felt like a scam unbelievable .
great dinner had to get a second order of the prawns they were that good this place is a must visit if you are in the rittenhouse square are .
ordered a pizzaz pizza probably the most artificially made crap ive ever ordered and expensive too i dont recommend buying from this place its crap pizza .
love it much like amada the food is excellent .
ordered pizza and it never showed called back to check on order and was hung up on repeatedly love their pie hate their service .
i rarely rave about restaurants food but tinto sold me every single thing i ate was amazing service was okay not great and the tables were really close together but the food trumped everything strongly recommend .
the location is actually on 9th just north of south street the crust was tough and chewy me no like .
great creative food good drinks great service one of my regular stops .
ordered from here a few time but never again my large pepperoni pizza had rancid pepperoni on it totally disgusting with all the pizza places in the area ill choose a place that uses fresh ingredients .
not a traditional spanish tapas but food was pretty good have good selection of wine too .
the food is good but the 3040 minute delivery estimate on a sunday night has been and hour and a half so far and im still waiting thats pretty bad right i can wait this long and get a much better pie from francoluigis .
tinto is a dinning event a must for anyone who loves tapas .
pizza was the saltiest i have ever had .
great service get the potatoes with blue cheese sauce very good the crab was also excellent .
the delivery was pretty fast but the pizza was only soso nothing special mama palmas doesnt deliver but the quality is ten times what i got from this place i wont order this again .
its all about a tasty dinner just let them design your experience .
poor service below average food for the price living on the hype but i will not return .
awesome server and wine list .
overrated ive gotten the pulled pork sandwich it was mediocre at best .
garces is legend checked this place out for restaurant week incredible incredible food great wine list intimate ambiance pretty much all rationale conversation gave way to primitive gruntlike appreciation for pretty much everything that came across the table go here go here now .
yes this places serves pre made canned salsa and guacamole but this place has not much mexican food if you like not too bad burgers or sandwiches with french fries then go here if you are thinking of mexican food you will be disappointed .
very good meal go with a group and order a bunch of items to share everything was tasty .
this place is alright ive gone on a weekend and its been pretty empty the food is decent i wish they would put more than a drop of tequila in the margaritas .
visiting family here from la area a good diversity of dishes well prepared good service a little pricey otherwise an interesting and pleasant dining experience .
perfectly bland for those lovers of bland in connecticut .
if anything go for the egg salad i have never had an egg salad like that moist yet dry spreadable yet viscous just delightful i would go back for the egg salad and the kobe beef .
overpriced and overrated the food is very bland for mexican i ended up dousing my enchiladas with the 99c hot sauce they had out on the table the restaurant is extremely loud and its not easy on the wallet .
yes this was a great spot for drinks and dinner fun atmosphere and really nice spanish wines that i had never had before .
i just dont get it give me a real american grilledcheese with cheddar or give me a croquemonsieur .
great place for date night the portions are small but you will leave full but not stuffed pricey but you get what you pay for service was top notch .
the waiter had to lecture our group about our payment method we felt very belittled and wouldnt go back because of it this place is not as welcoming as it can be to those who are newly 21 so disappointing .
tinto is a beautiful space the small plates are pretty small but they are diverse and wonderful i highly recommend this place for anyone looking for high quality delicious food in philly you will not be disappointed .
loud divey cheap youll find beers for 1 here yeah 1 for draft but it quickly becomes a shitshow frat party after dinner time go here to pregame and head out at the first signs of uvm .
food was great portions perfect selected 9 plates and would order all of them again except for the short rib great selection of red wines .
i used to love going to this place in college looks like college kids still do the draft beers have changed and it still smells like a basement dark and dingy oh and no women another place that has lost its luster to me over time .
cozy and intimate great atmosphere i thoroughly enjoyed everything and it was well worth the price i plan to go back .
underage in a frat like underage chubby girls wearing way too little clothing this is the place for you .
my favorite restaurant in philly ive been here several times and usually opt for the chefs tasting menu sometimes with wine pairing ive never been disappointed .
why do people always go here its a favorite of st mikes uvm and champlain students but i have no idea why its dark its overcrowded its too loud and its pretty creepy .
this place is great for a date night we decided to get a hoge poge and share everything and how could you not there are so many great options on the menu .
ive enjoyed this place in the past but our last trip consisted of a 10 moscow mule served in a plastic beer cup if the drink was well made then i could make an exception but i think it was sprite and vodka .
their brunch is out of control i highly recommend the grits and the pork belly its expensive but we appreciate it every time we go it does not dissapoint .
the bar area smells out of one of the three large bottles of beer they offer waiter opened a belgian bottle of beer with a wine opener wtf .
been here twice and ti keeps getting better everytime jose garces places are always killer incredible wine selection and great for groups since it is tapas style go in expecting to spend a bit more than normal but you will not regret it .
after 20 years of walking past the place i finally stopped in for lunch what a disappointment very limited menu and overpriced for the quality level obviously a good place to have a drink and very pleasant ambiance unfortunately like many of princetons restaurants just over rated .
excellent food everything on the menu is great .
i enjoyed my meal but we couldnt get service at all we had to wait a long time to get drinks meals check everything i wouldnt go back for that specific reason i did enjoy the fries and my burger hence the two stars .
the chefs tasting wine pairing might be one of the more adventurous meals in the city .
i ordered a chicken club i was served a chicken sub basically a wawa sub for 11 seriously not cool 2 stars .
tapas were fabulous waiter was knowledgeable make full use of their recommendations recommend the chestnut soup and the lamb skewers wrapped in bacon .
quite generic pub food .
the food was amazing i am never disappointed with garces go hungry and i would suggest the tasting menu .
this place used to be the best restaurant in princeton about 1012 yrs ago now it is a rundown old dump with ok food and poor service dont bother with the place .
met former colleague and had wine and tapas at the bar great setting good wine and very good food just loved their mixed cheese offering pork belly turbot and scallops were all excellent choices bartender was also friendly and knowledgeable only downside is the price .
the rolls werent even good the entrees were bland and watery we even found packaging paper in one of our dishes the water said oh sorry and then gave us the check and we left so overrated .
quieter and a little more formal than the front room amada but same superb food not to be missed .
got the waldorf salad and lamb stew everything was kind of bad the salad lettuce was limp and the lamb was dry too bad i wont be coming again .
good innovative tapas good wine list and great ambiance overall convenient location in the heart of rittenhouse square .
the fennel dusted seared tuna is one of the worst things ive ever eaten the tomatocapercalamata relish that it came with ill it was salsa sprinkled with capers one of the worst meals ive eaten blergh .
my 1 fav food in philly hands down .
i see this place changed its name has anyone been to new location was it sold i did not write down the new name i hope the service an food improve only gave it one star had no other choice .
tinto is really awesome the restaurant is comfortable and the food is absolutely amazing i recommend trying the octopus its awesome my only gripe is the servings are very small but extremely tasty every dish pretty much leaves you wanting more great wine selection too .
bad customer service the lady who takes orders picks and chooses who gets their order first people with groupons and people who are not regulars are treated bad i will not return to this place food 3 stars .
spot on service food was terrific had the fall tasting menu nice beer selection and the white sangria was really good we left very full tables are close together but not uncomfortably so ive seen worse .
this is not korean dont try it not worth the money michelin has not figured out how to rate korean cuisine undeserving one star money well spent for an undeserving experience .
went there for nye this year great menu fabulous atmosphere excellent wine .
not worth the money the food is really bland totally underwhelmed there is no korean flavor and the mushroom dish is the best dish the service is really superb .
you wont be disappointed definitely but worth it best wine by the glass selection ive seen food is a sensory delight staff is professional and knowledgeable .
very good food but im taking a star off because its just way too expensive for what you get .
i was at tinto for the first time last thursday we had the tasting menu the food was absolutely fantastic i cant wait to go back .
neither here nor there the quintessential problem with fusion cuisine disappointing the worst is when the sea urchin stinks color me an uni snob highlight was the palate cleanser bad sign you better believe it .
this place is like the lesser version of amada i would rather spend a few extra bucks and go there try the fried oysters and maybe one of the red meats p .
closed 4 years ago .
so much better then amanda yummy the lamb in a stick is an o in your mouth .
rob s also left me a comment about how i must have gone on a bad night and personally mentioned me in his one and only review thank you rob s im sure millers will get better with due time just provided my experience .
this place is pricey but totally worth it simply put this restaurant serves some of the best food i have ever tasted .
ordered food from here and my food never arrived couldnt contact the restaurant for help either .
amazing .
isabella we were there the night before i wrote the review so it would have been august 17 around 830pm .
jason was my server impeccable service and perfect food the best way to start your week i had dinner on monday treat yourself and youll have a good week champagne and chocolate desserts never hurt anybody .
i ordered grilled salmon and sautéed spinach for takeout and to my dismay the cashier told me it was 27 i know i can get grilled salmon and sautéed spinach at any fine dining restaurant in caldwell and it would not be 27 thats offensive .
outstanding dinner had the chefs menu paired with some great wine and just loved it .
stay away service is poor ever time we order delivery its worng today it was burt better place go prices are a rip off stay away .
sangriaaaaaa bambinaaaaaa .
italian factory type place have to eat pie there for best results got delivery recently and food was dominoes like no bueno unless u want a quick slice while passing by .
i went to tinto last night and all i can say is wow this restaurant is one of the top restaurants that i have ever dined at i enjoy tapas and feel they had a flawless execution of service and food .
not impressed with the ambiance food or service its average italian food at best with no real emphasis on flavors or being unique just the usual breaded stuff covered with the usual sauces i think they get away with a lot because they are popular .
great spanish tapas at reasonable prices try the amazing chestnut soup .
i dont see the hype about this place the pizza tastes like its come out of a box and the service isnt great id recommend going to angelonis .
we had at least 15 different dishes and there was not one thing i didnt love the wine selection is superb and the ambience is very trendy yet unprotentious have the mojito too .
the food just doesnt move me .
wow the food combinations in this restaurant are creative amazing and delicious its like you are eating art i highly recommend this place .
not the best in town since the arrival of angelonis right down the street .
i finally had the opportunity to make it over to tinto this past weekend for my boyfriends 27th absolutely delicious our waiter was very knowledgeable recommended an excellent tempranillo and was extremely accommodating to my gluten free diet garces trumps starr yet again .
i just made my first and last visit take out to john and marias it smells great driving by but the pizza was short on cheese and sauce as well as flavor essentially it was oily thin crust .
my favorite tapas bar in town awesome food and great atmosphere .
i have had excellent pizza in this establishment and i have had horrible pizza in this establishment very inconsistent i guess it all depends who is cooking will i go back no i just dont like wondering if its going to be good this time around .
im a whore for jose what can i say p s they now have brunch on sundays .
gross boring flavorless if it was yummy i wouldnt have mind spending 10 for a small plate of watery steamed chicken and vegetables will not go back .
one of the best meals my fiancee and i have ever eaten we had dinner at tinto during restaurant week and were still talking about that meal absolutely amazing .
this place has the worst chicken ive ever tasted they definitely buy frozen chicken and bulk and then cook it because its incredibly dry for 10 dollars frozen chicken and veggies is a scam .
i definitely liked it the decor was pleasant the service very good and the food pretty good its not quite amada but i definitely a fan .
overpriced very bland falafel im pretty sure its just baked mashed chickpeas and strangely sweet tahini will not be back .
so many fish and veggie options i love this place every dish has its own distinct flavor .
dont ever order take out from this restaurant reception was so rude and the rice was made days ago nothing is fresh here worst chinese resturant ive ever seen .
i love this place its my favorite high end restaurant in philly progressive forward thinking food dont love everything grg does but this one is really great the fact that philly loves this place so much also shows what a truely great restaurant city weve become .
quality going down yes it was very busy but not an excuse for poorly prepared food weve been going there off and over past ten years definitely not as good service is still good we ordered asparagus with garlic the garlic was raw very greasy not worth it .
lord jesus this place is delicious yeah its expensive but worth every penny we did the tasting menu everything was absurdly good but i probably couldve eaten 15 orders of the duck confit the iberian ham and the steak alone gotdamn .
eclectic mix of thai chinese and sushi but quality is below average sad that over the last 10 years they have taken advantage of their status as closest place in town .
excellent tapas inviting atmosphere good service visited during restaurant week excellent menus and options for 35 pp the meat was the highlight of the tapas plates vegetarian options were good some substitutions if you needed them .
lack of consistency some days are good and some days are beyond bad stick to american chinese food if youd prefer traditional cuisine are not authentic and price are ridiculously high driving 30 minutes north to edison is probably the best bet .
great place by the same chef as amada ask to be seated downstairs possible as the ambiance feels like you are in spain .
this is a sister operation of tiger noodles in princeton go there .
great for lunch i had the saladsandwich combo both my salad and sandwich were interesting especially for their use of ingredients the salad had asparagus and avocado which were nice touches my steak sandwich was pretty much perfect ill have to come back for tapas .
the noodle is okay other dishes .
i came here late last night with my friend since we didnt want to venture from away from where we were staying all i have to say is blood orange mojito made by ben is simply perfect .
not that great a typical americanized chinese restaurant not really for chinese maybe good for american .
they seem to be greatly amused that a tall blond white guy wants to eat pork and scallion congee for breakfast not sure why cuz its super delicious and cheap as hell .
ive got to be honest and say i didnt feel good after the fish i had there maybe they had an off night .
owned by such a cute nice old lady the menu is definitely inexpensive shes super quick with the order i love the rice noodles and fish balls i usually get a medium 3 worth it in my opinion youll be full for a while .
this is not portuguese bbq and the prices are crazy hr customer service is ridiculous we waited 20 minutes before anyone came over to take our drink order save your money and take the trip to newark for real portuguese bbq .
definitely one of my favorite spots she should to be less stingy with the sauce though i think she charges extra .
the pizza is not great feels outdated the fries where also sub par i would not classify this as good pizza .
cheap delicious fast and convenient located right outside the f train station east broadway highly recommend the rice noodle with fishballs pork century old egg congee and steamed sticky rice with chicken and other yummy fillings wrapped in lotus leaves .
i had been here like a year back and definitely i would recommend it then but now the food is not that great pretty pricey for the taste not going to come back .
when i can i try pick up some rice noodles before work it is a cheap delicious eat ask for the soy peanut hot sauces with a dash of sesame seeds if your a fan of fish add some fish balls .
sometimes you just feel dirty after being someplace that is how i felt here i needed a shower this place just wasnt clean food was also what i call pseudoitalian not like what my dad cooks not legit .
5 stars for the nice lady who makes delicious rice noodles and sticky rice to keep me fed during these dark times .
nice bartender very friendly and attentive had a salad fair at best worst part was the nasty smell as soon as you walk in smelled like a mens room .
noodles and fishballs .
nothing special about this place food is bland not sure if any of those reviewing ever ate outside of a chain restaurant in nj .
i am definitely on the love train for this place rice noodle mecca go there now .
this place doesnt deserve any stars it was horrible disgusting omelette and tasteless potatoes oh and the coffee was gross too my daughter found two hairs in her food there is nothing positive about this place go eat somewhere else .
my favorite breakfast spot in nyc amazing belinnis waffles and eggs benedict just dont forget to make reservations and avoid sunday brunch crownds .
more italian than diner food is so so service is ok theres much better in the area .
nice spot a little overcrowded .
as seafood bars go this is mediocre at best lobster in roll didnt taste very fresh presentation so so .
really great service and really nice ambience lovely french wine list with lots of choices and great cocktails too the waiter was really nice and knowledgeable about wine great service .
waited 20 minutes for someone to take my order left because i was hungry all the yelp reviews were right place is the worst .
amazing food and service would highly recommend we had a reservation for brunch and absolutely loved the food reasonable prices brunch but alcohol prices we kind of obscene enjoy .
disappointing the best way i can describe this place is oversized the prices portions calories fat its all just a little overboard its not completely awful to eat here just beware of what you order .
incredible duck confit foie gras and chicken liver mousse super cute interior and atmosphere friendly attentive service pricey but to be expected love it .
found a dead fly in my salad and there were a lot of flies near my table very insanitary and gross never coming back .
amazing just a tip you have to make a reservation well in advance .
run if you can we order twice and both times all what u can get is the stomach problems .
breakfast brunch coffee .
the only one that enjoyed the four dishes we took outgeneral tso tofu only edible one broccoli and greenbeans vegetable dumplings lo mein was the garbage disposal pity those folk who think highly or even adequately of this place come to hoboken or anywhere else .
this is my second time dining at balthazar and both times have been an absolute pleasure the food while slightly expensive for lunch is well worth the money it is a real gem in the heart of soho and i would recommend it to all .
awesome quality we usually make it to go on saturday night the food is always good and the price is best in the area .
great place the duck confit was cooked to perfection abd the lobster and black truffle risotto was sooooooo amazing the place was packed but the service was still spot on our server was super cool and helpful we will be back .
best i can say is that i wont eat there again i wasnt so lucky .
simply one of the best meals ive ever had just went for lunch and everything was perfect .
as a brazilian guy i was very disappointed and vowed not to come back to this place food was bland there was no variety on the meat just a meh would go to a different place with more variety .
fabulous place for brunch .
all i have to say there were insects in my salad my friday night dinner was ruined for me and my friends i dont think ill be eating at another buffet again .
cozy atmosphere great for a date or family dinner duck comfit was a little overdone for my taste but the have great wine list and amazing deserts .
not the brazilian food i was craving .
love this place great steak and frites love the beef tartare wonderful wine selection the tables are very close to each other but its nyc sparkling rose is a must when waiting at the bar .
disgusting dirty dont waste your time .
great all around great customer service i cant figure out what is holding back the 5 star portion size price point the wait whatever it is this place is still a good 4 .
1162011 if you like salty food food used to be good lemon chicken is good just salad if 6 99 prices vary depending on who is at the cash register buffet ok lots of food with beading and fried things .
a great brunch experience can be absolutely packed and a bit crazy chaotic so not a relaxing brunch but really fun with groups located in great part of soho and highly accessible there breads pastries are off the charts too definitely worth going to book early .
soooo lame food was yuck cold and ugly service was absurdly inept sat on back patio which was nice even gave me the wrong check .
this is a great place to go and feel like you are in paris good is very good and service attentive difficult to get a reservation on the weekends but love their seafood and ambience .
the food is delicious but the low rating is for the customer service i ordered delivery the driver was late which is forgivable but they forgot an item in my order and did not refund me for the item i will not order from them again .
it was such good experience their trout was the best ive ever have strongly recommend it .
i went here looking at the ratings it has got strawberry lassi was horrible it tasted like milk not at all sweet lemon soda was very sour samosa was ok paneer was chewy .
best mimosas anywhere and an outstanding breakfast we had the scrambled eggs with puff pastry and the corned beef with eggs excellent service time to get a table was 45 minutes but we were glad we waited .
ordered at 615 food arrived just before 9pm everything was decent albeit cold except the chicken saag watery flavorless just plain bad id be willing to forgive a bad delivery if the food was good but i cant abide by an indian restaurant that cant get saag right .
fantastic meal easy relaxing hot spot .
unfortunately our most recent experience with chatni has been very negative the manager has changed and the quality of food has drastically degenerated we will not eat here again .
super busy reservation must amazing food especially the plateaux de fruits de mer steak tartare .
the food itself was ok but the portions were way too small for the price the place was also understaffed on the night we went with only one waitress for the entire restaurant there are much better options for indian food in montclair .
dinner july 2014 nice open atmosphere although a little loud for conversations foie gras and chicken liver was surprisingly good as was the warm goat cheese and caramelized onion tart good cocktails .
sorry have to differ with a lot of people on this place food was definitely mediocre especially compared to satish or brick lane it looks like theyre new business but my meal was pretty weak everything down to the chips they gave got take out .
i am giving it 4 stars because the food was good but you would think when you order 24 poached eggs you would think they would be runny not hard boiled inside .
quite expensive for what you get the sea bass was good but when youre hitting nyc prices at 30 an entree you gotta remember this is jersey but the place does look nice its just overpriced good for a special occasion but there are better choices around town .
definetly one of the best french restaurants in nyc the food is amazing the atmosphere is very upper class and chic didnt like their foie gras too much though the added salt was a major let down .
terrible bugs service was horrible .
great service marvelous food decent coffee marvelous service gorgeous atmosphere .
unfortunately there were a huge gap between an awesome service and the quality of food .
the location is great and i went there with my friends i got balthazar bar steak with fries and with their balthazar sauce the steak was amazing and i love it ill definitely come back next time .
slowest service ever go somewhere else the chicken chili was barely room temp warm as well .
i love love love this place the people the atmosphere the food it can be very touristy but i never mind it i love whenever i get the chance to come here .
eh not impressed maybe the yanks up north think it taste good but i thought it was mediocre at best .
amazing eatery in soho always packed for a reason the food is always cooked perfectly great cocktails and attentive staff i work in the area and this is my go to for business lunches always a crowd pleaser .
disappointing food but nice decor .
went w my girlfriends and had a blast ordering their 3 tier seafood appetizer soo amazing i cant wait to go back to try other things on the menu and the location in the heart of soho .
crappy service at bar same lame server from applebees where she was very unattenive also bartender should be working at the post office wont be going there againl .
came for fathers day brunch it was busy but the service was good an efficient bloody marrys were great tangy and tasty beef stroganoff and smoked salmon were great highly recommended .
save your money this place is the worst .
stopped in for brunch last saturday 070514 i must say it was the best eggs benedict ive ever had great job .
really bad even for a cheap chinese food restaurant i expect the food not to taste slimy this would be a good hangout spot for high school kids with low money and lower standards .
love this place awesome food iove their duck confit as busy as they are the service is good and the energy and ambiance are thumbs up they know how to run a restaurant would recommend to all my friends .
horrible pizza the sauce is bitter and the crust is burnt .
the service was excellent and the food was superb i ordered duck confit it was amazing my friend ordered the duck shepards pie it was good but not as good as the duck confit my french 75 was perfect i have no complaints .
nope sorry this doesnt qualify as mexican food .
fantastic restaurant love the steak frites gets crazy crowded so make sure you make a reservation way in advance .
well its just true its meh ive experience better was it edible yes was the staff friendly and the restaurant pretty yes is chipotle better yes .
the atmosphere is great and fun but the food is a little off in flavors the smoked salmon was good a little too oily but the sides were a weird combination .
if youre looking for a family friendly place with great service this is it but if you are looking for true mexican food this is not .
excellent food good atmosphere excellent servers .
takeout is probably your best bet a bunch of kids are running the front and they are just interested in chatting it up with their friends basic service was lacking food was pretty good not amazing .
the frisée salad was phenomenal i ordered the steak which was cooked to medium rare perfection it is very loud so if you are looking for a more intimate quiet environment to dine this is not the restaurant excellent dinner .
friends recommended this place so had to try very far from true mexican experience .
i dream of these fries almost every week love the vibe and food is good in general but they have the best fries in town .
this place gets by on the fact that it is the only tacoburrito place in upper or downtown montclair there really is not that much to say about it beyond the boilerplate yelp 2star meh ive experienced better so true .
delicious french food has a nice ambiance not for kids or big groups we had the onion soup steak et frites and the lemon mille feuilles for dessert and everything was absolutely delicious i will definitely go back when i visit nyc again .
the food came out fast and good but it was the worst service of my life never coming back again .
the best service hands down water glass is always filled hosts and waitresses are always friendly and attentive food is greatbut a little on the pricey side such a cozy spot cant ever go wrong with balthazar .
cant really think of anything nice to say other than mediocre food at best .
very nice for graduation lunch recommended steak tartar and steak frittes everything made to perfection the only thing though service was a little too much .
eaten here several times usually good for all the reasons listed in other reviews got sick last time wont be coing back btw it was the bbq pork taco daughter had the bbq brisket burrito and did not get sick .
loved the sea food yummy great vibe great food great service see you soon when i am next in ny .
kid friendly but service is poor food is inconsistent often quite mediocre a mismatch with prices if a chipotle ever moved to montclair tinga would be a fashion boutique within a few weeks .
nothing to complain about here pricey yes but you get what you pay for oysters skate steak wine all fantastic come here if you want to eat rich food in a lively place with your fancy pants on .
as per my tip too expensive and not authentic i suppose for montclair this is good mexican .
i was waiting to review this page and now i see they are closed ny eater comarchives20… .
small selection expensive for how small the portions are and absolutely devoid of spice .
ordered onion soup its really yum but after that i was so full lol so directly went to desserts overall a nice restaurant .
chili is awful it is basically beans in tomato sauce no flavor they did not include any of the accompaniments mentioned on the menu no cheese no sour cream no rice nothing wendys offers a far better chili that is less expensive this recipeand the serviceneeds attention .
this restaurant knows how to cook french food and that the secret is adding lots of butter steak with pomme frittes and herbed butter was the best steak and fries i have ever had highly recommend also do amazing pancakes amazing wine list spendy but worth it .
bland food lacks flavor stick with chipotle for decent mexican at this price what a dissapointment .
went here for mothers day we split a le grand chilled seafood tower it was amazing then for the mrs we got profiteroles what a great experience .
i put this down to 2 stars because they dont accept the restaurant com certificates anymore this means its not as cheap as the food is p i also like el mexicano in passaicclifton a lot better .
great food and great service the ambiance was excellent and our server went out of his way to make us feel welcome in new york .
went here recently for quick dinner had a so called chicken fajita it was actually a burrito that was soggy flavorless dreadful wife had a pork burrito that was just soso food was awful would never recommend this place .
good service attentive both had the bar steak medium cooked perfectly but we both thought it needed salt even with the garlic butter fries were perfect as usual no hassle as we had a business meeting and stayed there for over 1 hour would def go back .
very attentive host good food eh .
i cant recommend anything other than steak frites as thats what my mouth demands each time i go there one of my favourite restaurants .
when i say medium i do not want my steak well done the rest of the menu is all meh 2 stars for making a decent dirty martini and nice ambiance .
take a break from your afternoon shopping and get some cappaccino and dessert duh it is so good here xooxox .
delicious veggie dumplings but my avocado salad and husbands veg pad thai were soso i see they have a big selection of items with fake meat so maybe they are better with those dishes .
took my daughter on her first visit to new york and it was the highlight of the trip .
pizza isnt anything special the pasta is okay out dated style on the inside some old guy was cursing a lot not too child friendly was pretty dirty inside prices are high for the food quality they serve .
better than ever had a marvelous brunch with our daughter jennifer her friend just wish our other daughter amanda was here thoroughly enjoyable cant wait to come back .
just another bad customer service spot avoid if possible its confusing you gotta fill out a slip for the sandwich the menu is a mess i wish i had more for you coffees cheap there you go theres one good thing .
great food love this place bartender dave is very nice .
food if just bad i tried the pizza twice and the caesar salad it was all bland and just not good .
it is a must have restaurant in new york i am impressed by all the food that we ordered i took my family there in a freezing spring morning but we enjoyed the brunch it was the best brunch i have ever had .
quality food but terrible service if you would like a roll or an extra tortilla you can go elsewhere you are not allowed to order and pay for additional sides of say sandwich bread .
great service and food .
yea why do i call mexican taco spot and i get some chinese guy answering and taking my order hung up and not ordering from that place i want mexican food i want to hear spanish mexican guy say hello not chinese guy .
delicious and really surprised that the service was so quick considering how busy they were i had the steak pomme frites and it was so tasty the meat was tender and cooked to perfection ill def be back as its a great all rounder .
waiter should learn what good manners and customer service is im sure the place is great but the waiter was as unfriendly as it gets i didnt even sit down and i left .
a new york classic that is not overrated great for breakfast great for dinner especially the roast chicken .
first the guacamole was subpar then my chicken tostada and chorizo tacos were bland for a place that seems to want to separate itself from gringo mexican food these are glaringly obvious issues the snotty service is just added incentive to stay away .
great friendly service excellent food the scrambled eggs in puff pastry was delicious eggs with spinach and artichoke was also great the bread and pastries at the boulangerie next door are awesome .
if it is the same owner as the jersey city location then avoid like the plague that guy is an asshole moby wannabe who hates his customers .
the service is great if you are there early you must get the eggs norwegian it is unbelievable .
just tried this with coworkers recently meh food one of the dishes had cold pieces of chicken in it signifying a frozen and badly reheated dish i liked it slightly better a couple of years ago biryani was ok but the remainder of the dishes were very unremarkable .
killed it but too expensive .
food still sucks no matter what management its under .
amazing traditional french dishes be sure to try to duck confit and the rabbit desserts are a must .
unfortunately i had a bad lunch experience here i got the uptown burger the onions whee uncooked and drawing in grease while the fries were uneatable the whole place smells like old fried oil not pricy but too pricy for the re re re used oil .
delicious fries and a drink that knocked me out .
have been to this place for brunch and it was much better dinner was pretty bad they clearly dont care much about their food the fish tacos were totally flavorless tasted like frozendefrosted minced fish with some flavorless dices tomatoes event the burger we ordered was subpar disappointing .
food was great and the staff was excellent if you want to be treated well come to this place .
i had the steak frites and was disappointed the steak was thin and tasted burnt and was full of gristle and about one third of the fries were overcooked and inedible i wont go here again .
duck confit was just ok desserts were really impressive better to make a reservation come to have fries and dessert p .
everytime i go there its an hour long wait and i leave annoyed so i wont be going there good luck .
the old girl has still got it cool bar good looking mature crowd and excellent service not to mention well executed french cafe staples nice selection of fresh oysters too .
overrated there is absolutely nothing special about the food here and the space with its awkward seating is nowhere id like to go back to unless someone really insisted not really sure how theyve stayed in business this long .
one of her favorite places to go for brunch when were in town a bustling interesting atmosphere the food is always good make a reservation ahead as its difficult to get in for a walk in on the weekend .
8 for a cup of tea that tasted like nothing not about that life also super uptight atmosphere no thanks .
great bartender service oustanding french onion soup crazy good beef strogonoff found myself in the area midday and popped in for some warmth and a drink classy fun and great people watching a must .
the dessert is good but no reservations minimum 3045 min wait when there are tons of open tables i hate when restaurants do that im waiting at the top of steep stairs glaring at those six empty seats grr .
im happy to say that every few years i head to nyc and pop into balthazars and every time i am happy with the food its a big deal to be consistent and were talking years ive had multiple items on the menu and everything has been delicious .
wait time is decent ordered a beer didnt get it ordered salmon toast they forgot it party of five with friends server didnt seem apologetic so it was like i didnt even eat there due to service .
seriously one of my favourite places in the whole world the location the deco the food the service are all outstanding they poach a perfect egg for breakfast the moules are really juicy too people watching in here is one of my favorite pass times .
nice place and good service we tried only desserts but for the price they were not good at all we trusted the reviews and tried the sesame brûlée and chocolate soufflé with raspberry sauce it wasnt good left disappointed .
love the placeambiance came here for brunch had the french onion soup a little salty for my tastes eggs were good and the scrambled eggs in pasty puff was always delish saw a lot of beef stroganoff go around might order that next time .
cha an was very disappointing i tried it because it has 4 5 stars on yelp the service was terrible infrequent table visits from our waiter no water unclear menu and absurdly small portions we got sick from the undercooked pork appetizer as well .
classy restautant with style and history very nice food and wonderful wine selection prices are not to high and deffinately worth .
the food was really terrible we ordered the cha kago bento box and the salmon smelled fishy chicken was not appealing the desserts however were wonderful will come back for desserts and tea which its known for .
even though i think the food here is just ok i love this place its always packed so have a reservation or be ready to wait for a table personally i love sitting at the bar have some oysters and enjoy the people watching .
i was truly disappointed with the service here they totally ignored us as if we didnt exist this place was one of the places that i was looking forward to but i guess not anymore .
this place takes brunch food to a whole new level we went here with a group of about 15 friends and each and every person loved it if you are looking for the brunch spot in ny look no further .
it was just ok nothing special the food wasnt good and the desserts are just ok i wont go back again .
perfect the duck confit was succulent and perfect that is all one needs to know mixology of the cocktails might perhaps befit royalty this place is my sanctuary until i saw my bill lol .
i must have missed the chaan boat its small hot and fussy i did not feel serene or relaxed at all .
fantastic for brunch impeccable service and even better menu the brioche french toast was superb went on a busy saturday morning and we were seated right away simply wonderful food of course there is the occasional celebrity sighting as well .
order was completely wrong after they assured me that it wouldnt be a problem wouldnt bother coming here again or at all if you havent .
sat at the bar this sunday and had cisco serve us by far the most amazing service and hospitality ive ever received from someone forget waiting for a table go straight to the bar ask for cisco order the shell fish platter the pate and rejoice in splendor .
3 stars for food 1 star for service decent bluecollar lunch pail type of place but the serrvice is very bad and inconsistent pancakes were pretty good had a crepelike texture that i enjoyed eggs were cooked well you could do better elsewhere .
here for the brunch today the egg benedict is mind blowing i give it for 5 starts the ham and potato are perfect the french toast is just so so .
this place is awful the bread was cold and stale the salad was soggy and the main dish capellini was lukewarm and salty wont be going back to this overpriced place ever the only good thing about this place was the service the waiter was attentive and nice .
we recently had breakfast here and will definitely be back the smoked salmon was amazing we tried the herb omelette as well with cheddar cheese and would recommend this place .
we had a mixed experience first we were seated next to a large group that was very loud throughout most of the dinner the food was mixed the steaks were good but the pork special was a bit overcooked and was tough the clams casino tasted terrible .
love this place i always have lunch here whenever im downtown i love the duck and always grab coffee from the cafe next door .
poor quality the soup tasted like it came out of a can the bread was stale and the meat was under seasoned the service was decent but not enough incentive to come back .
great french environment went for breakfast had a booked table a bit crammed with small tables and not much presonal space maybe its a french thing great enjoyable food and decor would recommend it .
just rude i couldnt believe how rude all the staf was and just will never go again not getting this customer again .
charming place even if overcrowded they recomend to book in advance but if you are 2 persons they can always find a place within a few minutes you must taste duck shepherds pie drinking a negroni worth the visit .
do not do take out they didnt understand our simple order and the manager gave me attitude he was so rude and it was so disrespectful .
a little too fancy for brunch the options are really decadent maybe ill go back for dinner i wasnt too impressed with the weekday brunch menu .
there is much to choose from if your looking for variety it tastes alright not bad or good i wouldnt waste my time or money with this place go to a good chinese food place there are a few winners around .
french onion soup and the burger are phenomenal fries are regular frozen fries meh the bread basket is superb salted butter mmmmmmmm yes coming back here after the holidays to try the steak frites cant wait .
if youre thinking of eating here dont .
this was my first time there and i was not disappointed we were made to feel very welcome everything from the food to the service was impeccable i cant wait for my next visit .
skip this place if you are a vegetarian i tried 3 vegetarian sliders worth the 3 different sauces pesto tomato and parmesan which were okay but the actual vegetarian ball was horrible half cooked beans without salt or pepper and not with the 3 bucks a pop .
i was there recently brunch was really good staff friendly and on pint i will recommend this place .
over hyped restaurant in nyc chicken vegetarian meatballs couldve tasted much better there are restaurants out there who can do awesome job you have to admit that their prices are more affordable but i wouldnt comprise for the better experience .
this place is gorgeous though one must make a reservation weeks in advance or wait a long time we had very nice steak short ribs skate mussels we had a great waiter for our party of 6 paris in nyc .
overall subpar food way too salty but terrible service makes it something you should skip .
great space and food its an nyc must .
i dont understand why people are so into this place this place isnt good .
great food one of my favorite places to eat in nyc decor is nice only downside is that you have to reserve weeks in advance in order to get in .
every meatball aside from the veggie has pork in it so beware if you are health cautious about pork .
really fun place good energy we started with some champagne at the bar then had great dinner moules frites was good reasonably priced wine list a slice of old paris in new york to be redone .
has anyone met the owners daniel holzman hes a total db and from what ive heard hes been a db for a very long time amazing people who treat the general public and employees so poorly stay in business eat at your own risk .
a big treat to dine in this reasonably priced and delicious french restaurant the mussels frites are delicious along with the fresh beet salad the raw seafood platter is also very tempting definitely a keep reservations highly recommended .
tight loud and overrated .
sensational escargot and steak au poivrè bearnaise delish the service was wonderful 10 pm seating on a random night was just as fabulous as a 730 pm on saturday night its a must .
maybe one of the most overrated places in nyc and whatever you do please dont open your takeout in the restaurant you will rudely thrown out of the restaurant .
i love balthazar impeccable service and the food is consistently amazing things to order that wont let you down escargot french onion soup steak tartare the oysters make a reservation also great wines by the glass .
just meatballs with sauce at the end of the day nothing special dont go out of your way but if you want some late night munchies while being drunk and is in the area go for it .
the escargo is amazing here ordered 2 and i recommend the steak and frites medium rare then you can die happily .
dont try ordering takeout from here 15 minutes just to get someone on the phone .
great ambiance for groups and really solid food .
the service was less than stellar and the food was not hot at all my irish mother can make bigger and better meatballs that this socalled shop .
fantastic dinner roasted chicken was the best i have ever tasted linguine was great tasting but i think i paid a bit for eating that much garlic service terrific .
this place is complete bs mediocre food horrendous service the hostess will never be as cool as she has decided she is i have been here several times and each time it has gotten more pretentious and lazy avoid .
fantastic place went for a very special occasion and it did not disappoint great service great food i would recommend the dishes we ordered but im sure everything is delicious there having said that the duck confit was amazing .
for a meatball place their meatballs are just mediocre tending to be on the drier side i always enjoy the pasta under or sides more then the balls but its not called pasta side shop is it .
a great spot for lunch if you are walking by we never make reservations and usually can get a table if we cant we keep walking for dinner a completely different situation reservations are a must .
manager some new chick with short hair was very rude told me wait outside for my take out order didnt ask me politely if i didnt mind doing that you ask you dont tell people what to do .
the long wait for a table was worth it good brunch food .
the ambiance is cool and beer cheap however the meatballs are dry without enough sauce ikeas are better .
higher priced restaurant but very worth it everything was delicious this place is ultra busy though you need a reservation or you will be waiting for 3 hours .
food is good but the wait was not well organized for large parties hostess was not smart enough to make better seat arrangements to accommodate first come customers .
two words eggs benedict .
love the neighborhood thought the meatballs were spicy and disappointing the restaurant is small and loud especially the music and crowded food came out fast but overall thought its overrated and portions are very small .
classic french food very well executed prices are high but the quality and service is as well .
the manager kindly responded offering to host me on my next visit sounded very sincere cant knock em for that id go back .
balthazar is one of the classic downtown spots it looks like a real parisian brasserie and has the raw bar to match i love this place .
no delivery please .
its very expensive but the french toast was amazing .
what the ell is wrong with this place bumping nwa bumping it at 7 balls are amazing though 4 5stars guess they can play whatever but not giving props on yelp for that even though i have a few nwa songs on my itunes .
really enjoyed this place nice little brasserie pretty typical bistro fare so if this is your thing you know what to expect a wee bit pricey but ah well .
beef meatballs cooked in pig fat really and then it wasnt even stated clearly on the menu really wish i could give a half of a star outrageous .
if you want to feel like you are in paris with a touch of new york this is the place to go martini is great and the food is as in the best french bistro try the oysters we love it .
food and prices are fine but the service is horrible ill never go back here .
one needs to experience it at least once while in new york it keeps true to the french bistro vibe food is decent but can get bettter more reasonably priced bistro style food elsewhere .
i dont get what all the fuss is about with this place the meatballs are average at best and absolutely not worth the incredibly long wait they have good beer on tap and the staff are friendly but if youre after amazing meatballs i suggest you look elsewhere .
my absolute favorite i eat at least 3 meals here whenever i am in new york not to mention the bar which is great people watching and amazing service home away from home .
tiniest balls ive ever seen .
love love love this place my favorite restaurant in nyc whatever you order will be amazing the staff is fantastic and helpful and the decor is one of the best parts if youre and french fan and even if youre not go here .
possibly one of the most overrated spots in the city it was ok but nothing worth waiting in line for .
simply excellent tremendous service decor and food a little expensive but hey its soho .
this place is just ok its tastes like the meatballs youve been eating your entire life get over it .
food is good and fresh famous nyc stop make sure you have reservations or else prepare for a long wait service is very good no complaints at all good location as after lunch we walked around the shops in the area .
do not get the hype the bread was mushy the meatballs and sauce were bland the crowd looked like they were shipped in from connecticut .
dinner wine and atmosphere all a everyone at the table all had different dishes and different choices of wine selection not one person was disappointed .
this was really disappointing my order was lost and my brother finished his at least five minutes before mine even came the food was largely forgettable im not even into writing this just dont go there .
i have been to balthazar twice now both times i have fallen in love and went to breakfast heaven a place to take all friends family when they are in nyc .
would go back for the ice cream sandwich meatballs were just ok not worth the wait unless youre just getting a peanut butter cookie ice cream sandwich to go yummm .
the frites are amazing the restaurant decor reminds me of typical parisien brasserie good food pretty close to the one that i eat in paris .
it was a 2 dry meatballs not very tasty meatballs the salad was really good the service was really on the money the meatballs were mediocre sorry many friends raved but tonight not so good .
i love this restaurant amazing omelets great service and you always leave knowing you had a great meal that was made by people who care and have standards it is always packed and yet you always feel as if you get the right service kudos .
i used to go there all the time at least once a week theyve really gone downhill everything just isnt the way it was .
other reviews says it all i dont think i have to explain much check out the pics its amazing noms .
the fish is so damn fresh i just found a scale in my spicy salmon roll .
met friends for a french breakfast in soho very parisian place very good breakfast great decor it was packed it always is and very hot inside definitely recommend it .
food great service solid advertising 25 off happy hour drinks on the same chalk board that your special are on then claiming sorry thats only for the bar upstairs an unsavory end to an otherwise pleasant meal .
my wife and i had a wonderful time here when visiting the city the food was exceptional and the service was terrific the only reason this doesnt get a 5 star is that the prices are a bit extreme if you want to indulge enjoy .
worst dining experience in philly to date shiteous service mediocre very overpriced food poorly presented and what a dank ratty interior what a waste of time and money .
best french fries in new york really good authentic french food and an incredible raw bar apple tarte tatin was only ok though really great atmosphere and really feels like your in france .
bad service mediocre food we were inconvenient for the waitstaff .
worth going back to yes ive been multiple times and plan to keep doing so dish worth ordering again warm goat cheese and caramelized onion tart yes shrimp cocktail no lobster risotto yes steak au poivre no steak frites yes .
the food is okay certainly not worth the price the salad was fine thats not too hard the ravioli was okay but the sauce it came in was gross dessert was almost inedible .
this place is awesome food was great and so was the staff i had the steak au poivre my meat was cooked to perfection for dessert we had profiteroles and they were fabulous make sure to make a reservation ahead of time .
sub par bbq came here twice the burnt ends were decent the ribs were more like beef jerky fries not very good mac and cheese good but nothing remarkable beans were good .
does a good brunch a nice bloody mary a nice eggs benedict served in beautiful surroundings by professional staff .
mediocre food poor service .
delicious french onion soup and beets salad steak and fries were ok .
awful service no free refills was in the bathroom for hours after it took an hour to get a coke with no free refills hate this place we live here there goes the neighborhood ive had better meals at applebees bar grill and applebees certainly offers free refills .
food is good i had the duck confit .
this the most nasty place is like no the same went i wast the 1er time 1 year ago but is hipster wherever food bad place ok and shehira the best and over price for empanadas .
the atmosphere is typical new york loud and proud steak was tender with good flavor i remember the fries were salty and delicious even saw jude law in a near booth .
empanadas are just ok the cubano is good though maybe a bit overpriced overall impression meh .
amazing food and service loved our sweet waiter they even gave us complimentary champagne and pastries for our short wait huge fan i will definitely be back .
the cuban sandwich gave off a bit of a school cafeteria vibe empanadas were served half lukewarm and half cold i dont know if it was just an off night but im not sure that i would return .
i was impressed with the décor as i walked in and by the buzz of activity this be everyones favourite the service was friendly and attentive and the food lived up to the hype .
the food was good but i spent 20 dollars and i left starving the entree portions are not meant to feed even children .
what a scene what a lamb sandwich those fries .
really wish the barnyard was better than we were told it is a tired locals place the food weve had is not predictable from visit to visit .
long waits but worth it definitely good to try it at least once i would come back but be prepared for the wait .
burger was okay service was eh sat outside plastic cups for beer horseshoes was fun after dinner .
this is a great place to stop in for a quick breakfast .
nice location and secluded area however i didnt care for the food its well priced but nothing special i ate a steak while i was there an wasnt thrilled .
walked in on a incredibly busy saturday morning seated right away and cocktailing commenced i want to say i had the squid appatizer and some kind of aweseome grill cheese sandwich hostess was great to get us in without waiting the brunch menu should satisfy anyone .
skip moes and make the drive to the new chipotle on route 1 moes cannot compete with similar businesses when it comes to taste and selection they fall short of being a go to mexican fast food place as they are not that fast .
best fries in the world period .
taste is no taste quantity40 less than chipotle fresh ness not fresh at all salsa are old canned type will never come back bcos it is not worth wasting your money or time once chipotle opens in this area this place will close down for sure .
good food and great drinks highly recommend for brunch return yes frequency occasionally .
i dont think this is a real japanese restaurant most likely chinese owned trying to pass for japanese anyway its has no ambiance and the food is very average not worth the stop .
they have the best fries in the world eat the caramelized banana ricotta tart it is awesome .
decent food but overpriced for what it is also the setting is a bit grubby service could be better too too bad .
one of my favorite spots for sunday lunch .
found a fly in takeout rice will never go back .
quite good food beautiful place and friendly staff the duck was slightly chewy but everything was tasty very noisy difficult to have a conversation .
closed out of business kaput building for sale .
love balthazar amazing brunch palce definitely worth the wait got the waffles with berries and was an amazing sweet dish highly recommended .
sevilla spain chicken cordon bleu i didnt have it but seeing the dish on the menu made me suspicious about the authenticity my taste buds were let down review 2208 i m y .
classically amazing bistro restaurant service and food are always spot on not cheap but its always packed and popular from 7 30am till 2am seven days a week a unique restaurant .
just tried to get a salad and i was told fairly rudely no salad it was 630 supposed to be open until 8pm shame on you old nelson i frequently get my breakfast items there but now im seriously turned off by their poor customer service .
my favorite steak tartare with fries in this city super fresh hand cut beef marinated with capers evoo and a little red onion topped with a quail egg simple classic and to the point .
the worse minestrone soup pure tomato sauce no consistency of beans vegetables or pasta the bartender said he was sorry owning a business ourselves we would of offered a drink on the house very disappointed .
duck confit is good but hard to not order the classic steak and frites .
ordered citrus chicken delivered cold returned and came back warm sitting in a citrus greasy marinade no bread served ordered sparkling water never saw it the decor is very cool other then that there will not be a repeat performance .
one of my favorite brunch locations anywhere the eggs meurette will change your life .
i like the atmosphere here but the menu is boring nothing seems very appetizing weve ordered cocktails which are pretty good and dinners and its just alright i wouldnt eat here again but i will stop in at the bar for drinks every now and again .
consistently delicious oysters and steak frites is all you need to know .
weve gone here a few times with friends there are no vegetarian options except salad the menu is pretentious and overpriced including the 14 salad for the vegetarian were over it there are better options in hamden .
the food here is very awesome and so authentically french the vibe is high paced and rather loud the staff is very polite oh yeah did i say the food is very yummy i went her on my way to paris to get prepped for the vibe .
limited menu ok food indifferent service above average prices enough said .
awesome lamb sandwich and good service restaurant is super busy so be sure to make reservations also its pretty loud in there so dont expect any quiet cuddly time .
i went here for a simple breakfast just waffles and eggs when it came it looked yummy but didnt taste as it looked waffles tasted like the freezer ones and there were a ton of shells in my eggs not good very disappointed had higher expectations .
simply delicious perfectly executed french cuisine loved everything about the experience escargot appetizer and lobster truffle risottounbelievable we left full and happy we will be back .
horrible service .
one of my favorite places in nyc whenever im in town i make a point to stop there the service is fantastic and you may spot a celeb or two .
while there were many empty tables we waited almost a hour until they served over a dozen customers who came in after us so we went and asked the waitress who was extremely rude and explained that they dont have a table ready for 3 .
everything about this place is amazing the service food and ambience was fantastic make sure you make a reservation we waited 45 mins for a table for two on a tuesday night .
your service and your food terrible you must to development before late thank you .
lovely lunch but problem with coat check made us wait 15 minutes just to get our coats back .
the worst cuban sandwich i ever had dry so so very dry .
great dining experience in soho .
i used to love this place delicious cubano sandwiches arepas tostones yucca fries lately i have found the sound level to be far too loud for relaxed dining and conversation .
their steaks are the best and 18 for a carafe of nice wine is very reasonable .
see matt ks review i was with him pretty disappointed by what village voice said was supposed to be one of the top ten burgers in town from what i could tell they cant even cook a patty .
my favorite restaurant in new york there isnt anything in this place that i didnt like its always always crowded but i didnt mind sitting at the bar a couple of times french fries are the best .
okish service pretty good food a little plain but we were trying to eat healthy kinda weird that they took the tip without saying anything before bringing us our change and then expecting a tip again .
good food location more casual than youd expect .
decent enough but inconsistent delivery have gotten our complete order only once out of at least 7 attempts .
update it still rocks all the standards plus well thought out and executed specials great ambiance bar is terrific staff is very welcoming if you like noisy convivial places with great food go here .
twice in a row with pick up issues officially lost my business by the way management a simple apology would go a longways instead of no eye contact and pretending like im not standing there waiting awkwardly for 20 minutes .
the food is quite good i had the salmon and as salmon goes it was some of the better ive had the atmosphere is greatreally does seem like a french brasserie plus john lithgow was eating there at the same time which always speaks well of the restaurant .
where are all these reviews coming from the owners anyway the sushi is not good here weird and inattentive service which was not appreciated tip to server if u forget a tables appetizer apologize .
good french food in the soho area of nyc the place is always packed so i would recommend a reservation .
nothing special about this place will never try it again .
im going to keep saying this over and over steak tartar and balthazar steak yum yum yum attentive service great food got a table in the bar area quickly at dinner time there is nothing else to say food great service great experience great .
horrible old flavorless food .
solid 4 5 from me very upscale setting and environment personally for the price i paid it was nothing spectacular but the interior and the ambiance gave a boost to my rating try it out but be prepare to pay the bill .
awful pizza was dry n cold when they delivered it not to mention it was an hour late .
the food really is good there the waffles are sooo good crispy the dough is amazing the service is okay had to work to get our waters refilled the dessert was just okay also didnt get enough bread for the foie gras .
used groupon and the service sucked the price was so high for so so good we will never come back .
great food service is friendly and efficient consistently delivers the best .
terrible customer service manager and waitress wouldnt accommodate table change the table we wanted remained empty the entire time we were there the waitress manager hounded us until we moved .
love it simply perfect .
probably the worst food in the area they still carry a decent amount of craft beers but now so does every other restaurant .
incredible pan roasted chicken incredible chocolate cake for such a nice restaurant it lacks pretentions .
this is one of the most overrated restaurants around the food is simply mediocre thats it .
this place is an institution love the ambiance and the food doesnt disappoint either beautiful crowd one of those places to see and be seen a favorite for sunday brunch .
over rated i guess i just dont get it good place to drink but to eat it a crap shoot same dish can go from a b to f next time in .
ive been going to balthazar from day one when it opened after all these years it never dissapointed it can be very crowded and long wait for a table i always get the seafood grand plateau you gotta see it to believe it what an experience .
the drinks were ok and the food was tastless overall nothing to write home about good service thoughgreat attempt .
great experience food was great service was outstanding a .
despite the internet stating that they allow dogs it isnt true the queue was massive so we have up left very disappointed .
their wine list is amazing came here for happy hour and the place was packed bartender was great ordered the app size of their seafood risotto and i was speechless best risotto ive tasted wish i wouldve ordered the entree size will definitely come back here for dinner .
not anything special and the coffee was lukewarm and tasted bland like a dunkin donuts the eggs and toast with home fries were very ordinary needing salt and the toast was underdone and had almost no flavor expensive for very little .
loved the beef stroganoff oh my cant get enough of it and the service was absolutely wonderful waiter was very attentive eventhough the place was very busy i will definitely come back .
i literally waited a half hour just for a toasted bagel with cream cheese everyone that came after me ordered very complex meals and got there orders the service for me was lousy .
simply wonderfull experience waiter is the best a bit noisy but food is amazing .
not a fan maybe i have to try something different but the turkey burger sucked but the sweet potato fries were pretty good and the smoothies werent bad .
pricy but delicious pâté was some of the best ive had the trout was grilled to perfection had a blackberry and plum tarte which was outstanding wife had mussels and frites both were excellent very nice decor friendly staff a little loud but not unreasonable .
reviews are stellar and the ambiance is good but how does a place with such a reputation serve processed american cheese on its grilled cheese they should be serving the ultimate grilled cheese and instead its oily plastic .
the best french bistro i have ever been to i think bouchon in napa valley may be the only place that could compare to this great ambiance great food great service loved it .
salty fart turkey burger and fries it was poshhip it was spensive .
they have the best food ever i must go there every time i visit ny really good service and food .
yeah this just screams nope its all family style so its just one big plate and you share thats fine an all but not really my style also yeah its nyc but fu it was expensive i just didnt care for it sorry .
balthazar is always a favorite goto for good french fare specially whn we are looking for a meal tht promises not to disappoint .
i am just not a fan of family style restaurants especially when those restaurants offer such little gluten free items honestly i am shocked that nyc has such little gluten free options to offer nice family friendly our waiter was super friendly and informative .
great lil french bistro a little disappointed we couldnt get mimosas since they dont service alcohol early sunday mornings great cup or i should say bowl of latte eggs benedict was pretty good .
not impressed we got the chicken marsala it was blahhhh would not recommend pick another spot .
came here for sunday brunch sour cream hazelnut waffles with warm berries were good but their hot chocolate was so good i had another one their ratatoille omlette was not very good hence the 4 stars .
food was ok service was horrible it was just there she took our order brought us drinks had to search and beg for refills and brought our food definitely not worth the price .
balthazar is a reason to go to new york in itself and every time i go to new york i go to balthazar it doesnt get any better than that the room is amazing the menu succulernt and the wine list next to none .
terrible phone reception hangs up without a good bye rude .
i love this restaurant the food is great the ambiance charming i especially love their brunch and highly recommend the hazelnut belgian waffles yum .
ive had better this place has become a noisy food factory serving institutional italian food .
yep a busy saturday night so ended up sat at the bar great atmosphere and the steak frites were good .
the bread was great but entrees and sauce tasted sour olive garden crushes this place super pricey and portions way too large for the first date hiccup the blueberry mojitos are very good go for cocktails and a bread basket then leave .
great food great service very very cool place food 4 service 5 cleniliness 4 .
the quality certainly is not the same as it used to be waiters just sloppily serve u and the food is sub par .
greatest french food on earth .
off all the italian places in nyc why go here yes portions are big and family style and service was good but food is mediocre at best chicken parmigana was salty tepid and the sauce was watery an absolute tourist trap that i hope to never return .
wonderful they handle big crowds like they handle brunch seamless and tastefully .
meh been there a few times not impressed there are far better restaurants in the city .
i went here for breakfast and it was sooo yummy how do they cook their scrambled eggs so well i dont know but they were really really nice and i dont even normally love scrambled eggs .
tourist trap food served on large platters family style covered in tomato sauce .
went for a sunday brunch chicken liver and foie gras mousse is what you would expect delicious and the sour cream hazelnut waffles are great as well .
its been a while since ive eaten here i remember the food being fine and the portions being very large but what really stuck out at me was how incredibly hard not al dente but hard the noodles were maybe i just dont get it dunno .
always good classic french cuisine si buenisimo .
this place is grossly overpriced nice bartenders though .
came in for brunch and it was pleasantly packed had the beef stroganoff and toast cant wait to come back .
this place is a rip off not authentic italian restuarant its just like any other chain restuarant and the food is priced way high nice way to ripp if tourist .
fabulous perfect ny dining experience amazing selection of wine the chicken dinner dish is excellent and authentic felt like i was in paris for a night .
overrated probably from all the tourists that go there way too packed and food bland not worth the tourist trap .
the decor is great the restaurant is very crowded lots of tourists food is good not remarkable could use a few lower priced bottles if wine waited 1 hour after my reservation if you live in nyc there are other very good options service was excellent though .
not a good idea if you are a small group like two or so we left almost more than half of the dishes .
finally experienced balthazar and how special it was for a special occasion do it up with the seafood tower amazing .
didnt even get to go in our reservation was screwed up and we were not allowed in then treated as if were our fault there are much better guessing service friendly and good italian eateries that will actually allow you to dine in nyc check them out first .
hand down the best breakfast ive ever had in my life this is a place everyone must go to and experience .
i thought this place was going to be way better with all the hype it gets much better italian food in little italy .
quintessential new york experience the fries are perfect i love the vibe the food and the desserts this is a mustdo restaurant every time i come to new york .
there are certainly better places to spend your money for familystyle italian food in nyc .
best oysters and french fries grab a bottle of champagne and have a great meal .
the food doesnt match the legacy if you want good family style go to long island because this place is the olive garden disguised by family style portions combined with a tourist trap i cant believe i waited an hour for a table here .
great food and service clean and inviting ive had the eggs norweigan and the steak and loved it yum yum yum a must if you are in nyc cool casual vibe and oh so tasty is a recipe for sucsess .
the food potions in the restaurant are monster portions just waste of money .
i tried the bakery it was amazing fresh and natural ingredients not cheap but worth it .
how can a city like ny even have one of these they are the mecca of italian restaurants find a hole in the wall italian place where its fresher and you dont have to wait 2 freaking hours for poor service expensive prices and soso food .
breakfast was great traditional french influenced menu espresso was spectacular great to know someone still knows how to make real coffee .
good food but terribly overpriced there are tons of italian restaurants that serve big portions for a portion of the prices that they charge at carmines .
they serve stumptown coffee in giant bowls yumm and the bread and cheese plate is delish .
long lines food is ok but upper westside locale is so much better .
its a modern classic a little cliched but classic .
seriously get some menus if you like production line generic and overpriced italian then this place is for you the food and service were abysmal id rather cold canned soup .
this review is intended for the bakery an absolute revelation for french breads and pastries when they offer them you must procure and taste a cannelle .
we had lots of appetizers and pasta entrees everything was really salty i had to wash it all down with pitchers of water and coke .
love this place feels like youre in paris without ever leaving the states food isnt elaborate but is done very well seafood is delicious and the martinis are on point .
the sad thing about giving this restaurant one star is that the food isnt half bad for a pretheater dinner based on taste i prefer carmines over sardis but a cockroach ran across the table during my meal nuff said .
definitely one of my favorite restaurants in nyc i scored a seat at the bar just before they stopped serving hot food between 57 pm it was cold and rainy outside which made my mac and cheese taste that much better i love this place .
although people say they have good burgers i wouldnt know since i couldnt get in to try them without waiting an hour and a half and you cant make reservations either ridiculous go across the street to shake shack and save some money and no waiting .
went here last week for a work dinner in nyc and it was amazing the food is delicious the service top notch and the dessert was to die for highly recommend the steak frites .
waited a full hour for food this place sucks didnt even comp us stated they were trying to bring everything out at the same time .
delicious attentive to our needs and saw meg ryan in there on my way out very good experience over all .
food looked good nice decor hip crowd and crowded on a tuesday portends good things i just thought no room at the bar no music just chatter not inviting so we left ill try it again but for now no go .
one of my nyc favorites love the ambience the martinis the steak frites moules and most of all the 3 tiers of shellfish .
waaay overpriced for a greasy burger the pickles are a nice idea but 712 for an appetizer sized plate of vegetables in vinegar .
if you are in soho this is a great place to dine its always crowded and loud but thats just nyc the food is amazing i have eaten there a few times and will keep going back the brunch is really great as well .
sadly my expectations werent met here the burgers cant compare to rouge and im so over their no reservations policy and tiny cramped space nothing spectacular here jose garces youve done me wrong .
balthazar is classic romantic this is where i had my first champagne exceptional food and service .
awful expensive crowded horrible waitstaff .
it had the french soul and they accidentally served me french fries with my omelet considering it was noon and i was hungover it was unknowingly an excellent surprise .
i wanted to like this place it was nice inside an ok menu however the atmosphere was lackingperhaps because it was full of rude wannabes we ended up walking out after a patron refuseed to move her bag to allow us to sit .
definitely need a reservation otherwise its a long wait tip try getting a seat at the bar we went there for dinner and came back next day for brunch awesome pancakes oysters pate escargot great wine selection .
waitress had a real attitude food was good but service was awefull i will not be going back .
very good food the interior decorations is amazing it seems to be in a french restaurant .
food is ok but not worth the chaos long wait terrible service .
last time i was here i saw two celebs one being anthony bourdain who sat next to us anyways ive always enjoyed the steak frites and i got the mango cheesecake this past wkend and it was so good .
cash only establishment thats pretty average the inside looks dated but the food is acceptable nothing wow here .
great food and awesome service we did brunch and it was surprisingly good so worth the time and effort to get over there .
decent chinese food for the area but just slightly on the dirty side their pork fried rice is better than others but again its probably better to get this as take out and have your friend pick it up so you dont have to go in there .
same amazing food than pastis same chef with a upscale parisienne brasserie ambiance loved the manager host at the desk he is so awesome both breakfast and dinner were somptuous .
i asked for cosmo and it came with bad lemon not to forget that drink was bad our wings came sans ranch and blue cheese which was specially requested all in all bad experience .
yum steak frites was amazing .
bad execution only ok sushi never actually got my dinner better places out the .
one of the best restaurant in new york the goat cheese tart is to die for i am eating 2 of those every time i am there and then a grilled fish with there special sides yummy .
reasonable service i had the mac and cheese and it was so bland my friend had the sweet potato fries which were yummy nothing special and i wouldnt go back .
i only had the pleasure of eating at the bar once but i was convinced the best steak tartare in the city easily .
the service is horrible our server snapped at me when i politely asked for a drink the bartender rolled their eyes with my order and walked away without serving it these people hate their jobs and it shows i will never go back to that horrible place .
duck confit was excellenttt cute atompshere .
great ambiance service is slow which one can get over if the food makes up for it sadly although the menu was promising my alfies burger was like rubber sad but true .
excellent great service and food i ordered the french toast my dining partner ordered the burger no complaints i want to go back and order the mules frites the french fries are bomb i want to go back soon .
just tried to call to order pickup they said they couldnt because they are too busy due to the 2 games going on right now what happened to businesses wanting to make .
value average food good but nothing special of out of the ordinary service good but as expected for price range atmosphere tourist trap but decent enough not too noisy the food was as expected for the price range would repeat if im not paying .
couldve been an off night .
their bread is fabulous the chocolate bread is probably my favorite great for brunch went with a large group and had a blast want to go back soon .
service on a wed evening was very slow it seems like they were understaffed drinks are outstanding the food was ok nothing great small portions overcooked smoked pork chop and the duck was bland i wish the menu had morebetter appetizers .
twitter update .
this could be a really great place if the waitress had not completely ruined my experience she was rude and horrible to deal with what a shame because they have a really nice bar and good food .
the food here is fantastic i was here with about 4 people each of us got a different dish and appetizer and everything was great bouillabaisse get it also when i went i was sitting next to the wcw championship wrestler goldberg undefeated from 19972001 .
also wrote them an email that night and never got a reply finally got a reply but they just dont get it .
fois gras and oysters in the afternoon at the zinc bar are sublime the bar staff is so personable and the place really makes me feel like i could be in paris i hit this spot every time i am in new york which is never enough .
hip atmosphere in the bar area not as cool in the back dining room loved the short rib gnocchi yum dont order the pork meatballs no flavor .
great european style bistro type restaurant reminds me most of the belgian type of dining rather than french great steak frites and the service tries hard i will be going back to learn a bit more of this place .
just not that good .
food was excellent service was great but not pretentious all in all a great meal go for the seafood tower if you are feeling ambitious and your wallet is feeling heavy .
struggling to find anything good to say about the place everything from the food to the service and ambience was about a c .
expensive to the point of being a bit overpriced at breakfast but outstanding food coffee and service stop at the bakery for a quick breakfast well worth the walk down canal .
service was terrible disinterested and surly and we were clearly not regulars and thus not all that important the food was average italian at best maybe we caught a bad night based on the other reviews but it was a really bad night .
like a traditional upscale french resto in lyon just in nyc instead excellent food good service .
good brunch alternatives within walking distance of ants pants café lutecia resurrection ale house day by day .
nice stop in after shopping in soho sitting at the bar enjoying mussels with rich sauce and a glass of wine very good service and beautiful atmosphere .
a friend convinced me that this place wasnt as bad or expensive as i remembered she was wrong my fish tacos were stone cold fell apart at the slightest touch tasted like cardboard my guest wouldnt take more than one bite of his meal .
the napolean was the bomb thx esther for getting these .
waste of time slow service mediocre food i only went because i received a gift card i dont plan on returning .
this is a great bistro the food is delicious especially the oysters and steak tare tare the pomme frites are delicious and the hangar stead was yummy definitely a favorite .
every time i am in here im amazed at how rude the cashier is and how indifferent the servers are food is overpriced menu is not exciting or original .
this french bistro is a true original a true new york culinary experience walking in the door is like walking back in time the food is always great open for breakfast brunch or dinner .
place is no good pan fried noodles are like uncooked ramen and meat is mostly bone so many better places around made me feel like not being adventurous in places to eat .
ecargot at its best pastries are good too .
disappointing cant understand the good reviews at yelp the small restaurant is clean but the food wasnt tasty at all the service was not really good the guests were all typical yelpuser that believed in the reviews .
ordered the steak frites medium with bernaise sauce and they were delicious came here on a weekend and the place was full but im not complaining it had a parisian ambiance which made the meal memorable .
i asked the waiter what the places was known for and he said the ngow nam beef stew wonton noodle soup so i had the ngow nam ho fun the beef was tough and rice noodles not special .
best french onion soup ive ever had .
since i got there the waiter had such a nasty attitude then there was a peace of plastic in my dumpling soup and when i told him about it he got mad i thought i was being part of a joke unfortunately not this place is just terrible .
great food the french toast is amazing and the bouillabaisse is delicious .
2 5 stars half star below ok .
this place was great but it wasnt just about the food the service was great the feel was great it was more than just good food it was an experience i recommend it .
do not order take out from here i put my order in through yelp 1 hr later when i called the restaurant they said they are not going to deliver and hung up on me several times absolute truth this place deserves to be shut down .
the best niçoise salad in town hands down also fantastic for oysters and champagne served up in a traditional environment with beautiful decor and great light never disappoints .
unfriendly service all dishes we ordered was just ok a small bowl of rice cost 7 one of the most expensive bowl of rice i have even seen .
love it also love the side shop with all the delish breads best part is come after a certain time and everything is 12 off not bad loveeee the olive bread .
absolutely no service of any kind probably too popular and no need for customers we turned away cause did not get any attention from the staff also no credit cards accepted today .
it was long wait one hour for sunday brunch but worth it goat cheese onion tart was heaven very soft flavorful filling and crispy tart scrambled egg in puff pastry was perfect could taste every layer of pastry with fluffy egg bon appetit .
i went there for lunch and ordered one of the shanghai noodle soups with pork and wontons it was all pretty bland i wont be back its not bad but its not really worth your time .
i will never forget my first balthazar experience as i have never left a restaurant feeling so full in my entire life everything from the bread to the dessert was amazing i had the short ribs entree and it was delicious the profiteroles are a must for dessert .
came here drunk after a night out and woke up with diarrhea ordered a sesame chicken and the broccoli was still cold they only take 2 credit cards per bill .
we were here for the seafood and tried le bathazar a threetiered seafood platter and i have to say it doesnt get much better than this in nyc .
stuck to their more popular dishes and i would give flavor and quality a d would not recommend .
ive come here on several occasions for their beer and fries interesting selection of beer and amazing fries will keep coming back .
food was so so many chinatown restaurant can offer similar quality of food however the service is extremely poor the waiter demanded full 15 tips despite i given 10 due to their poor and rude service .
exquisite service special occasion breakfast on a chilly morning or lunch sitting the bar balthazar never disappoints my favorite place to ear in manhattan .
there was something funky about all the meat we tried here and the broth of the soup was between bland to gross there must be better places to get these dishes in chinatown .
fabulous we go whenever we are in nyc love this place .
bad unauthentic food water with no ice in mid summer rude and slow service i was charged tips you decide if you want to come here .
i love the food here but it is not an intimate place its so loud and busy u might get panic attack here its that crowded but food is really good .
meh im asian so i know how the authentic wonton should taste like the flour was too thick for my liking and the flavour just wasnt there nonetheless the servers are nice and helpful but i wont ever go there again .
this is my fave place to eat in new york brilliant food great service and lovely decor love it .
disappointing not the best wonton noodles it was mediocre and you can definitely find better much better perhaps even across the streetnext door .
i wish this place wasnt so crowded but its just so good fabulous fun place for brunch in soho .
cheap but bad food is ok but nothing good service is very bad you have to ask for everything you never get a smile and rarely a word .
we miss you .
i didnt understand what all the good reviews were about youve got to be extremely drunk if you think this place has great tasting food or you have to be new to nonamerican chinese food .
very beautiful indoor design and good quality food .
dont understand why the rating are high msg filled soup and mandatory tip for party of two never come back here table is sticky .
the one restaurant in new york that i love going back to the seafood tower is a must drink heavily cause they make the drinks good go late to try avoid the crowds just a great dining experience .
you get what you pay for most of the time the food was just okay for all three of us service was slow to start but then the food came out all at once i wouldnt go back .
onion soup in balthazar 55 onion soup from balthazar to go 25 .
meh we stopped in because of the good reviews unfortunately the food was just okay perhaps im just not cultured enough but nothing we had would bring me back well the hot tea was very good .
awesome and very busy plus noisy get ready to be pushed around but like it hehe .
service was quick and food was decent the general tso chicken left something to be desired too much breading and not enough chicken both fried rice dishes were average but tasty the fried wonton had a tiny sliver of shrimp better options exist in chinatown .
a night at balthazar is a night like no other the ambiance is so alive and for that not to mention the really superb food i try to go here every time i visit nyc .
why go here when you can go to big wong across the street the atmosphere here is grosser than the fast paced big wong the food and waiters pale in comparison just cross the street .
let me preface by saying ive only been here once for coffee and dessert coffee delicious dessert profitroles delicious ambiance french bistro esque bonus .
called four times for reservation for 7 persons and they couldnt be bothered to return my call so thanks for nothing the derby i will assume your food sucks .
the ambient is nice and welcoming the food is very good i recommend the steak .
grabbing a quick bite on a thursday my fish was full of bones all the soda was flat the bathroom was plainly disgusting never going back here .
loved this place came in on a saturday around 1pm and surprisingly was seated within 10mins had the trout salad which was one of the best salads ive ever had in my life the atmosphere is interesting also great place .
nice venue friendly waitstaff drinks and meals came out at random clearly still figuring things out in the kitchen drinks were heavily imbalanced towards sweetness food was bland interpretations of southern standards adding mushrooms on to a flavorless chicken fried steak doesnt help .
food and drinks were great really recommend this place .
while its a pretty bar and fancy looking the food is bland and service is lacking the food came out before the drinks and even they were poorly made also they refused to substitute on the already small menu as well as my undercooked patty melt .
really good lunch here lively atmosphere and reminiscent of a bistro in paris loved my steak tartar the moules frites were excellent had ricard pastis as a starting aperitif a nyc favorite .
i came here because of the yelp reviews i had ordered the burger and pulled pork the pulled pork had way too much sauce on it the burger was average but a lot better than the pulled pork .
love the food and the restaurant gotta come grab a bite if you happen to be in the soho area .
boy that was one salty burger .
my whole meal was delicious homemade fettuccine fries caramelized banana ricotta tart must come back for their pastries .
this place lacks the class that their prices ask for the food is soso and the price point is way out of line ive had the best this falls short of the rest .
fantastic restaurant great service classic atmosphere and delicious food for starters definitely try the warm goat cheese and caramelized onion tart and the french onion soup the entire menu is fantastic and youll find yummy treats in the bakery as well .
tried kasta kachori with aloo bhaji this has been the worst kachori i ever ate will not come here again or recommend someone to visit this place .
a bit too loud but the food was awesome and the service was great .
very bad place rude people work in there and food is just grose it f up your stomach and appetite very dam expensive for the price and the quality of food is just now rite .
i love that you can come here for lunch and get delicious frites waffles and wine portions were generous and the server was quite nice it truly is a good place to people watch or regroup after a long morning of shopping .
stopped going there some fried items tasted old refried the guy at the counter is very creepy he is the main reson for not going there again .
a bit spendy and overrun by tourists been eating here for years am i still one anyways salade niçoise and steak frites are classic .
terribly bad do not go here bad stale chaat pooris and spoilt sour yellow chamcham bought today and sincerely regret doing so need to report this plc .
big bustlin loud crowded fun for groups not so fun for dates brunch menu was on the pricey side but the grilled brook trout was delicious and the apple tarte tatin for dessert was just perfect .
the food was strictly ok too pricey for the kinda dishes they serve charged me 4 for a can of thumbs up their veggie burger platter is quiet big and filling but seems like a frozen and not freshly prepared patty .
legendary ambiance a tad pricey .
its just average indian food i didnt mind the food but for what i got how long it to get the food and for the price it was not worth it many better options in the area though .
i love it make reservations if you have the foresight we were unable to get reservations but walked in we were able to sit within 15 mn .
decent place full bar is nice the food isnt the best i think the appetizers are just microwaved pizza was okay but not somewhere i would recommend to a friend .
excellent all around two must trys from the brunch menu the balthazar salad and the beef stroganoff both amazing be prepared to wait .
worst pizza ever had a sad excuse for a margherita pizza it was dry not saucy and had old globs of mozzarella service was slow waitress was nice but took way too long for just about everything the order the grub and the check wont be coming back .
great eggs benedict but id say the place is bit on the pricier side .
pizza is bland never been happy with the food here .
great french place tight space but so fun to eat at i had the eggs benedict loved it and i love eggs benedictusually my go to brunch item very speedy service too .
update the service is still horrible brunch on sunday took 2 hrs .
it is a bit expensive but the food and the ambient is nice .
price is very good the taste is average i wouldnt really recommend this place kimchi fried rice is not as i expected .
went for dinner got seated quickly loved the place .
i got sick after eating their prepackaged food its really cheap and great for quick meal and i also know that their selection is various but i really think that they should care more about the food .
closest to paris ive had in the states food excellent for any meal staff is attentive and friendly saw borat himself sash baron cohen and wife one afternoon as well as princess diaries star anne hathaway .
do not get the beef with brown rice it taste like it has been there longer then my grandpa has been alive .
my favorite place in new york always excellent very authentic too a must .
the food is sitting in little heating shelves and under lights buffet style the sauces are dried up the kimbap is dry u pay for what u get .
good hot chocolate .
it exists to get you drunk near karaoke bars with enough chairs to sit all your friends just calibrate your expectations this has all the atmosphere of a middling high school cafeteria but has cheap soju in vast quantities .
luscious soy latte 1 flakey buttery palmier the perfect start to a long day of shopping in sunny soho .
not as good as before everything taste the same now i came here last time the food was harder to bit and chew on price is a little bit higher also the box is heavier .
whether you are going there for a special dinner or just passing by for your morning croissant and cafe you will be delighted with the satisfaction you find here .
overrated had spicy boneless chicken and shrimp broccoli dumplings both were terrible i love korean food but this isnt a good place for it chicken was sugary and stale with more skin than chicken dumplings were just gross at least its cheap .
great ambiance for a large group excellent service and overall i was the only person slightly disappointed in my meal out of 6 and with the steak frites surprisingly ill give them a pass on a undercooked piece of steak since everything else was perfect .
meh after those 1k 4 star reviews this is what you are about extremely disappointed the buffet was cheaper than most places but you look at the food and you know why its cheaper mehh .
great food must have reservations otherwise expect a 1 hr wait the cool wealthy soho crowd and probably the biggesthipnice restaurant in the area .
the food is cold and there is definitely not enough seats not much else i can really say about this place they do have a special if you check out the fridge area discounted sushiother dishes from probably the day before or early in the day .
everytime im back i try to hit this wonderful place good vibes and great atmosphere the staff are great and very attentive and fun always great food including the bread and desserts and always memorable .
food for those on a budget or looking to temporarily satisfy korean food cravings .
only way to do this place and not be overrun by tourists is 2am on a weekend get the oysters best in the city .
we were a little disappointed had korean for the first time the last time we were in nyc and loved it not sure if we just had the wrong thing .
one of my fave in the city great atmosphere great cocktails amazing food breakfast lunch and dinner you cant lose .
the place is small and cramped sometimes you cant seats to sit the food doesnt taste like the real korean food the price is acceptable the food is already cooked and done and put into a container this store gives off a feeling of seven eleven .
on nore time here very busy for lunch on a monday other the same thing strogonof delicious of course that i will return on my next trip to ny .
cheap tasty korean food but i found a huge roach crawling on one of the tables in the back the last time i went no thanks .
soooooo good perfectly executed comfort food in a cool setting with a french vibe go for any meal of the day .
i just dont seem to have a palate for korean food but friends seem to enjoy the food on budget .
had the best new years day lunch today incredible goat cheese and carmelized onion tart grilled salmon over phenomenal polenta and the lemon desert which totally hit the spot i love the people watching ambiance and energy no matter how busy it got the service was impeccable .
this place was just bad i was give it a zero if i could dirt cheap but bad greasy and without flavor i was sad there is definitely better korean and there is definitely better cheaper eats .
mjs star 3 5 price egg benedict 18 coffee 4 weekend brunch menu 1000am 400pm except tax tip .
a lot of the food at the buffet are dry inedible the korean people that works there laughed in my face when i complained .
incredible eggs norweigian i was just really impressed by the quality of the salmon and perfection of the poached eggs combined with mimosas and the company of my little sister at the bar breakfast was certainly served til 1130am to boot .
ive been coming here since 2007 and over the years it really has deteriorated the japchae now is filled with onions instead of real ingredients pretty lazy cooking pricing for the quality of food you get its a major disappointment the food is tasteless and bland .
adding a star for the eggs norwegian which are arguably the best in the city surprisingly much better than at pastis be sure to snag your brunch reservation early if you dont have an in .
i was disappointed with the kimchee fried rice i had such high expectations and for a place so highly reviewed i was hoping for the best we also came at night which maybe explains the lack of freshness in the foods we ate .
what can i say that hasnt been said already this is a nyc institution for a reason treat yourself a great place to meet up with people after shopping in soho fresh bakery is really the cherry on top or maybe im just another tourist gasp .
mediocre reminded me a a 5 china buffet back home except its not all you can eat and its not 5 00 there were noodles and soups and sushi that i didnt get around to trying and maybe theyre worth a better review .
glowing bastion of paris dreamy tasty simple comfort food that invites intimacy and relaxation i am always satisfied and never stuffed perfection at any hour of the day .
no aside from the kimbap and the ttuk something is seriously wrong with the taste of the food here i dont care how cheap or convenient something is not right .
4 stars for an awesome raspberry and fresh fig tart i will let the good exteriored but dry lemon madeleine go this time .
the bartender is aloof and insanely rude food looks overpriced 21 for a rigatoni bolognese dont bother go down the street to maialino better food and better service now i can see what the place is usually empty .
wow how could i have let this one slip through my mind i went here about a year ago and i love love love the decor and totally fell in love with the banana flambe dessert totally going there again soon .
love that we have shabu shabu here now but the the broth was seriously lacking flavor also i tasted no difference between the original broth and spicy broth even though you pay more for the spicy one .
amazing brunch order the 12 bread basket so yummy very noisy crazy busy place but the food makes you forget about it ill be going back thats for sure maybe for dinner next time around .
sorry this is just not shabu shabu and the frozen seafoods def not my favorite the decor is nice and something new but they really need to step up a notch on the soup base and the frozen seafood not to mention my fish ball was still frozen .
loved the whole roasted chicken and veggies cute ambience great for a sexy dinner date .
this was the first time i have ever been disappointed with hot pot on a positive note the prices were very reasonable and the broths were decent hopefully theyll get better over time .
yum great atmosphere everything was really fresh and tasted delicious the creme brulee was probably the best ive ever had i will definitely be back oh and if dinner was good enough having brooke shields walk by my table was an added bonus she is so beautiful .
i made the mistake of ordering from here as neither the wife or i felt like driving to our normal spot the pizza was dripping with grease and lacked flavor overpriced as well that is what we get for being lazy .
stopped in briefly on a food tour to try the chocolate chip cookies as well as the oatmeal cookies both were fantasic this little bakery is attached to the balthazar restaurant both were packed with loyal patrons .
as an avid bacon fan i came here super excited but was sorely disappointed the bacon was just a hard flat thing not juicy or anything like yelp says meh ive experienced better sorry barbacon i had high hopes for you you failed me .
really good steak frites the steak was excellent i also stop for coffee every so often in the morning on the way to work and it is aok .
tried the barbacon bahn mi should be taken off the menu bacon was too hard did not go well with the rest of the ingredients and overall disappointing will have to try something else next time .
excellent desserts try them all .
my 2nd time here our waiter seemed to disappear eventually the bartender noticed our table and another were being ignored and came over but he was covering the crowded bar i took forever to get a another drink and our check not going back .
loved it food is great .
terrible service inattentive waitstaff cocktails are all ice no drink do not waste your money here .
believe the hype .
although the food at this restaurant is good if you like pork the staff has a bit of an attitude the folks who take the reservations are completely messed up i would only go back for happy hour but you need to get there early .
great ambience amazing food nice bartenders beautiful people .
a fun novelty place to go but overpriced for what it is and poor service to boot we got our food 10 mins before we got our drinks .
with over 400 reviews they certainly dont need mine so ill be quick simply an amazing dining experience food was traditional french and the atmosphere is outstanding loved this place loved the people watching .
the food is ok i ate here twice and neither time was the food memorable the place itself is cute but its so cold in there lindsey was a great waitress .
possibly the best meal ive had in nyc in years i always thought this place was a lot of hype my meal skate was sublime simple yet not so delicious i cannot even over state it .
i wasnt impressed by anything here music is too loud drinks are too expensive and the food is mediocre .
went here for brunch and enjoyed the brioche french toast service was quite good .
horrible service the girls there are nasty when answering the phone too over priced for not so great food i stopped going there .
crazy good eggs benedict and breakfast pastries .
im very very disappointed with all the food we had home made pasta veal osso buco never tasted so worst italian food never go back again .
a french classic both as bakery and restaurant just as good for brunch as diner and classic timed environment balthazar has all you would expect from a classy bistro highly recommended .
we ate the special bottomless pasta dish nothing special .
delicious baked goods love this place for brunch great chicken liver and onions great consistent atmosphere when im back in my old stomping grounds .
never again this place is awful they are very very busy and the quality of the food and service has gone way down i will not be back also rude front of the house .
best steak frites steak fries with sauce béarnaise ive ever had in nyc never cared to try anything else setting with is wild and full of energy a must for a friday night in soho .
i have tried this place two years in a row 20132014 nothing special about it the food is not authentic italian the seating and customer service are okay however it doesnt deserve the 4stars rating at all .
in one word fantastic food is great and the decor flawless even though service is sometimes unnecessarily snobby and i do not use that word often visit and visit again i promise you wont be disappointed .
the pasta was so bland how is it that a supposed celebrity chef could serve such tasteless food at her restaurant these days as long as you have a tv show people will just flock to your restaurant regardless of quality .
eating here is like being friends with an old movie star sure the limelight is now shining on some younger shinier star but all the savoirfaire still lives with the classic my recommendation be a lady who lunches eat with friends late in the day and drink wine .
this place is way over rated we had the pasta special and honestly not worth the wait or the money the staff is great but the food is more like franchise resturant .
what a great place delicious breads excellent well prepared food had brunch here and loved it by far the most excellent server amazingly polite patient and attentive we all fell a little bit in love with him hehehe oh salman rushdie sat beside us tres cool .
overrated crowded .
still a great place to have lunch the service was great had a fantastic bottle of wine moules frites a rare burger and a tarte tatin a little loud but hey thats the ambiance nearly perfect .
poor service bisteca was over cooked very chewy flavorless and had lots of fat and sinew pork chop was very dry decent beer and wine selection .
i love balthazar the food drinks and service are very good it is a perfect combination of tasty food and reasonable price for a fancy restaurant .
came here before a party once so wanted to get lots of pasta in the stomach beforehand we had the pasta tasting and i thought it was pretty bland however wine was surprisingly inexpensive would come here again to just drink and get a few apps .
best mojitos in manhattan damn straight .
just ok nothing memorable the price was decent for nyc .
have been a longtime patron the food is always consistent the staff parexcellence the atmosphere is a little noisey a lot of business is conducted here as well as a place to see and be seen .
sinfonia 3 unlimited pastas of the day was undercooked and ive definitely had much better otherwise disappointed .
yep there is a reason why there are over 400 reviews for this place keep up the great work balthazar we love your food and enjoy your brunch .
the pasta were inedible the 22 for the dinner special would have been a great value otherwise .
great food in a lively atmosphere loved the clams steak frite and creme brulee perfect location to shop all day and then sit and enjoy an excellent meal at times it can get a bit too noisy though overall a place to return especially if im nearby .
tables are situated too close together this is my second time there and both times i felt as though i needed more space food was okay nothing great would not go back again .
love the atmospheres food was good service was good and fast make your reservation early or make sure you have plenty of time to wait for your table .
went here before seeing the musical once the service was great the wine selection is robust and meets the needs of every possible price point however the food was just okay you get what you pay for .
the food was perfect the service was above average and the vibe in the place was unbeatable put it on your must do list when in nyc .
i wanted to like this place but it was average the service was decent the food was decent the feel of the place is probably the best thing it has going for it would not return .
stopped in for cocktails and oysters oysters were very fresh and cocktails were on point friends dine here regulary and enjoy it very much will have to stop by for a full meal next time .
had lunch today ok experience waiters were friendly food was not what we expected flavor profile of the meals just did not seem right disappointing experience would not try it again with so any great italian options out there .
i was very happy with the bread basket thats all that i really care about good bread fresh bread lovely bread pretty bread good bread yumm thinking about that perfectly poached eggs benedict .
some elements of our meal were ok but the majority of it lacked flavor the rigotoni with bolognese sauce was very good though and the waitstaff were very attentive .
my spirit exhales every time i bite into their almond croissant .
ok experience packed you in like sardines very loud party of 10 next to us could not no even hear ourselves or waiter slow service only catered to large party food ok couples on both sides of us also were very unhappy .
great french bistro and the scene is dialed as well try the scallops and an after dinner drink at the cub room down the street m .
not even worth writing a review about felidias is much better .
good for a big group food and drinks are good lil pricey .
i hated this place please see xanga comfeedmoonbunny… for why i do have pictures of the food but i refuse to post them because the food looks great but tastes horrible .
ummmm doughnuts and the croissants are amazing .
came out fast tasted good but i have to admit i was a little disappointed who charges 13 for a salmon eggs benedict and serves up one egg and no toast what is this .
done to death with 300 reviews what can i add memorable decor and high quality bistro fare make for great meals and scintillating conversation topics brunch lunch or dinner are all well served at balthazar oh agreed its seriously busy .
super expensive upscale coffee joint serving lunch sandwiches and salads as well as the usual pastries great coffee by the way .
we stopped by to pick up some pastries the chocolate and lemon madeleines are full of flavor and so buttery tasty the pumpkin cheesecake was perfect a smooth creamy texture with an amazing flavor .
a bit of a letdown mainly due to the rave reviews posted on yelp our meal was very average really nice people and good service but dated vibe and uninspired cooking really expected to and wanted to like this place more .
love this place for brunch the pastries the coffee the eggs benedict oh my i am in love please note your reservation will not be honored until you entire party has arrived .
website and yelp list incorrect business hours they are actually closed every afternoon went miles out of my way to try this place and they were closed because someone is too stupid to put the proper business hours online .
amazing steak frites and banana caramel ricotta souffle loves it .
food is ok service horrible waiter put in wrong order and my husband did not get his food for over an hour till he decided to cancel his order then they said it was ready lol .
after so many years still great atmosphere attentive waiters and french to boot washington oysters out of this world and absolutely delicious steak fites and the au poivre excellent too cooked to perfection .
its ok nothing more than that i thought the quality of ingredients was good but the flavor itself is bland the service was excellent .
great french brasserie you will see there the most famous people from new york this is the place to be on the weekend for lunch if you want to be seen .
had a sandwich there today and it was ok but it wasnt what i ordered no one over 21 works there and it didnt seem very clean .
another staple on my annual new york trip we come here for lunch while shopping in soho it is delicious every time the staff is friendly and they have amazing french onion soup and french fries it does get crowded but its well worth the wait .
i like the place nice ambience and food but there was only tap water no option to buy a bottle of water and they dont have filtered water was dying of thirst and no clean water .
great breakfast the best chocolate crousaints in the city its tough to get a table on the weekends particularly for brunch but if you can snag one you wont be disappointed .
gave ew another shot with my roommate and again wasnt too impressed took about 15 minutes for our drinks to arrive to our tables their burger was absolutely mediocre and they overcooked the mediumrare i requested .
the atmosphere here is so happy and beautiful its just like you would think soho would be like the belgian ales dont hurt either .
i was encouraged by the reviews and decided to try this place well i was fairly disappointed even though i was starving the bread was dry and i didnt find anything spectacular about the rest of the ingredients maybe my expectations were too high .
killer breakfast and lunch yes its crowded but if youre flexible and willing to eat at the bar or at one of the bar tables youll be well rewarded weekday breakfast scene is nothing short of downtown powerbroker central .
pretty awful the pluses ok space watier tried very hard to please quiet the minuses my food the onion soup was bland mussels were luke warm not hot .
i had my first taste of a french baleeny here however you spell it its a very classy french place to me there is like no room to barely stand if you go after work though .
i used to love this place so much but once i received a lovely case of food poisoning i could no longer eat here sorry guys .
the steak frites were very good it was worth a splurge the atmosphere is very romantic and fills your appetite for french cuisine disappointedly the dont offer crepes of any form or bouillabaisee which would make it very authentic french cuisine .
overly sweet sushi rice if you like that i do not fluorescent redpink tuna was not desirable yellowtail was on its way out vacant flavored green tea perhaps i caught them on a bad day the miso soup was a treat though .
i love balthazar everything is amazing but please order the steak frites you will not be disappointed come to balthazar for brunch lunch dinner bring your girlfriends your date your parents or all of the above its one of those perfect nyc restaurants .
just ok americanized not enough flavor .
i was here once my paycheck doesnt cover this place but the food was delicious .
we have been here 2 times and this will be the last .
a little bit of a wait consider we have appointment with them a bit hyped but the food was good and they still serve a large group of us water after we finish our breakfast .
you dont post your beer prices you dont get my business .
two words eggs benedict o m g absolutely to die for great place to have brunch with company reservations are definitely needed before arrival sidenote this is a review for their breakfastbrunch i dont know how dinner is like here .
saw this place on diners driveins and dives and really wanted to like it fried pickles were good but my pork sandwich was way over salted and bland all around fish chips were soggy and also over salted .
great food cramped seating but a kate moss sighting had to be the topper a must when in nyc .
if you want to go to a bar where the bartender laughs in your face when you ask about a drink then this is the place personally id rather be at a bar where i feel welcome and not insulted when i order a drink .
jadore balthazar .
somethings amiss here these people are clearly reviewing dmitris at 3rd and cathrine while this page clearly says dimitris at 225 s 12th st which ive never heard of yo people wtf .
great brasserie that really captures the essence of soho ny awesome brunch menu always a fan of beet salad extensive dessert and wine menus pleasant albeit not the fastest service cant add much more to whats been said .
food is good but the service has always been a bit brusque and cold unfortunate as i live across the street and would love to make this place a regular .
food is always fantastic and i love the hustle bustle and energy of this place ive had many a power lunch here and they always prove to be a success so maybe im biased that its lucky .
wouldnt take reservations for 2 and told me to show up at 7 or earlier and we would be seated right away showed up at 655pm and there was a 45 min wait ill be sure to tell everyone not to go here know your business .
you know service is good if theyre still refilling your glass with water well after youve paid your bill food was great i recommend the eggs norwegian if you like smoked salmon jonasapproved .
poor service they let customers smoke around us hot dessert came cold they were pushy about the bill .
very good place to eat service could be a little better they know how famous their place is so they dont really care but the food is good and its the place to be seen if youre into that kind of thing .
would have given you 4 stars except for the hostess hostess would seat you first if flirt with her seen this happen a few times but dont get me wrong food was good and reasonably priced i would go back only when the hostess is not around .
i give 3 stars for the food and extra star for the service on a busy week night dinner was not rushed and incredibly affordable .
had a terrible experience with the owner and management of this place the food can be decent but the management is atrocious there are many many other better places than this in the city just not worth getting mistreated .
good place for a late night meal or even an early meal or just a meal just feels like how a new york brasserie should .
nice atmosphere and inexpensive you are getting what you pay for food not great just ok service ok .
ive been twice for breakfast both times i got eggs benedict one of my favorite breakfast dishes they were eggcellent both times its a bit noisy and crowded in there but the food is worth it .
not a comment on the food called to confirm a reservation for a large group for a birthday party they did not have my reservation booked 2 weeks in advance and did not offer any accommodation would not recommend for large groups .
sundays crossaint espresso sunday ny times at balthazars im a happy man .
i ordered the tagliatelle although homemade it was bland the sauce was mediocre i was bored by two bites i was really looking forward to this place from all the great reviews but honestly i will not try this place again .
this might be the location of choice for ihtreading newmedia types to grab a power breakfast en route from the equinox on prince and crosby to their soho offices but that doesnt mean the food isnt damned good and the cappuccinos dont forget those .
service was slow and it was not even crowded server in bar was bitchy slow and nonexistent food was barely fair first and last time here .
lunch was onion soup presaged by that unmistakable waft of gruyere it nearly knocked me over a decent beet salad with remarkably soft bunches of mache and a chimay red then i went shopping in my woozy beef broth trappist ale stupor best day ever .
went there sunday lunchtime and it was closed their website has sunday hours though may be well be able to try some other time .
too lovely for words steak frites yum but obnoxious waiter who obviously thinks all english people are idiots which is why they lose a star other than that a wonderful experience .
these people need to buy a bloody wine cooler buy a bottle of red and its above room temperature more like warm and gross .
one of my favorites in the entire jungle beautiful food people and entertainment eat at 10 stay till 4 stumble home .
22 for 5 tiny scallops dont waste your time those scallops should have been on the appetizer menu very nice bartender and okay vibe too bad the overpriced food ruined the experience .
penultimate dinner datedrinkscatchup place with great pommes frites and with the matching atmosphere to boot not as hypedup and us weeklyd as it used to be but still has not lost its allure and noise this place gets damn loud .
i think the quality of the food is good but it is terribly overpriced .
shop people watch in the village then relax for some good eats and great bar this place has a parisian feel a little rag time nice order a martini and reminisce .
arrived hungry left almost as hungry thats how small the portions were cant think of a worse way to mistreat your customers .
rainy sunday morning steamy windows hot coffee and an amazing brunch that had me staying till lunch then dinner the perfect french bistro .
i dont think it was good it was rather blend and lacked refinement i dont think i will go ahead nice environment though nice crowd however the food is not up to par which is for me the most important .
not so bad for brunch i recommend the waffles and berries but its pretty expensive so be ready to spend .
the concept of the breakroom burger was great the execution was poor the burger was over seasoned and over cooked the fries were reminded me of lunch room fries with some cheese and jalapeño the pork belly was good cant go wrong with pork belly .
the food is fantastic the chicken riesling is to die for unfortunately for me im just a brokeass art student so it is on the expensive side the next time im in new york i have to go back again .
slow service incredibly slow and disorganized food was fine nothing incredible .
excellent french food even the creme brulee was exceptional by european standards good atmosphere and good crowd of people went there for a wedding anniversary and the wife loved it .
not my cuppa tea .
one of my favorite bistros in nyc very parisian style the food is excellent and staff is really nice i love the escargots and the pomme frittes prices were reasonable and a great wine list the place is always packed and can be little loud .
stepped in on a cold night for a cup of chocolate for my girlfriend who was home for 6 00 received a tiny portion togo cup of average tasting hot chocolate although traditionally bitter it was pretty tasteless also no offers of whip cream etc .
one of those restaurants where you truly feel like you are embarking on a dining experience crowded well known and well loved the most happening spot for brunch in soho try it out and expect a wait .
dont believe the hype while the staff is nice the menu and wine list dont love up to the reputation skip dinner grab a seat at the bar and have a cocktail and tartine .
amazing place great service from the bartender despite the extremely crowded place i think her name was jin she was very attentive to my group and i and always made sure we were okay the drinks were also delicious and the music couldnt be better .
plates too tiny and not so many choices dont go there if youre hungry disappointment for us .
dragon wings is very addictive all bartenders and bouncers are nice but they sometimes have trouble when they are packed great old school hip hop bar in nyc .
seated people in front of us who were simply pushy avoid the wait and go to the little owl or commerce they are both way nicer also definitely overpriced you will spend the same amount at the little owl .
great music old skool hip hop cool people delish food veggie yum yum gin holds downs the bar and i simply love this place and would rawk out here 7 days a week nuff said come git some .
i could probably do without the onandoff french accents but buvette does a mean breakfast pastries are a safe bet and though the poached egg seemed more like some variation of overhard the veggies its plopped over are delicious in typical european fashion no skim milk 2 5 .
love this place free coat check great bartenders and staff food during happy hour is awesome two words bulgogi fries .
this was the worst turkish food i have ever eaten i sent my plate of lamb kebap to the trash will never waste my meal or money there ever again horrible would not recommend .
good music and good chicken waaangs .
the service is bad .
came here for happy hour with a girl friend we thoroughly enjoyed our lychee martini and lychee mimosa the pork buns were a tasty supplement yum .
nothing special kinda of a tourist trap .
must go for happy hour drinks and dancing .
extravagant prices soso food eatable but not delightful service well meaning but crude presentation leaves many aesthetic principles behind roof top view wasted with slow service demand to retain credit card when ordering .
drinks arent watered down crowd is great and so is the music for the times that i was there very small space however and no seating so it does get fairly stuffy and hot in there .
i wish i could put a 5 star rating this restaurant is beautiful and the food is amazing my experience was ruined by the terrible service we received our waiter ignored us it seemed like we were an after thought and it really is a shame .
if you love hip hop classics and great people this is the best bar on the lower east side .
dissapoitning across the board we went for hand pulled ale it was not what we expected having been to england many times they were out of 3 other drafts is this a british pub that doesnt have any british beer try oconnelys down the street .
my favorite bar in the east village the music food and staff are great also if you love hip hop look no further pork buns and mongolian beef are a must as well .
this place is just ok food is decent but draught beer selection leaves a lot to be desired came in for a few pints was sat on a stool at a table ugh and they were out of 2 of their 7 available beers on tap .
make reservation otherwise you dont get in thai food with a special touch we were in a different part with a table and pillows to sit in very spicy food .
i was so looking forward to the chicken pot pie i must have gotten a defective one underneath the lovely cheeseencrusted top were two tiny slivers of chicken a couple of small pieces of vegetable and a soupy sauce i left starving .
the dj on friday nights rocks the house the crowd is mixed and casual trendy the drinks are inexpensive and the vibe is chill mode good times .
the food is disgusting i dont know how you can screw up chicken wings and a salad but this was the worst food ive had in a long time the wings were literally soggy the beers and ambience at the bar was okay though .
great place to hangout music was awesome 90s hip hop mostly been there twice and both times had a really good time we also tried the tapas and wings not bad for a casual hip hop night .
not sure what this place is trying to be a sports bar an upscale hangout a restaurant it tries to be everything to everyone also the drinks were too expensive when compared to the other places in the neighborhood .
this place rocks hip hop and top 40s all night on friday great drinks and staff theres a 5 cover after 11 i think there are a lot of ladies here too so get your game on fellas .
first time there and i asked for two plain pizzas to be well done but didnt get it the pizza wasnt great like other reviews say .
best wing spot ever you know its a true wing spot when they serve you wings and they dont give you a fork and knife who eats wings with cutlery try the dragon wings and the honey ginger garlic wings delish .
i always wonder why when a friend wants to eat here twice now in the past 6 months there are so many other options here that blow this chain away .
good apps fun drinks great vibe what more do you want .
the worst vanilla shake ever do they know to put syrup in it ice cream plus milk is not a shake it is ice cream and milk so disappointing zero stars on the shake .
excellent hh deals throughout the week hip hop music and bartenders who are mad chill .
the fries were cold and the shake tasted like pure sugar not strawberry ive had way better someone referred me here i think as a joke .
ask for jin shes awesome and poalo i believe his name is cute filipinospanish guy theyre both bartenders and make strong drinks .
shake shack does not live up to its hype the burger was decent but nothing i would go out of the way for my chocolate shake was delicious and the fries were just frozen crinkle cuts .
great music and reasonable drink prices but if you plan on dancing all night be prepared to sweat because it is way hot when there are a lot of people on the dance floor .
visited with my son he absolutely loved his burger and fries my burger however was totally raw on a good note i called the manager and he was apologetic and offered me a free meal should i return honestly not sure if i will ever return .
come here for the lychee martinis love the atmosphere can get really crowded so come earlier for happy hour and bar hop .
you are famous for your burgers and shakes ughh burger is so less than average and shake which i just got is making me sick dont waste your money and pick other burger place .
yay im a fan pork buns bomb as fck lychee martini yas another please and the atmosphere is great if youre reading this and wondering if you should check this place out the answer is yes .
i ordered a shroom burger at shake shack an got a small patty on the ghetto potato bread you can buy at shoprite 12 for 3 19 the burger itself was alright but man this place is too expensive to be this bad .
awesome atmosphere great food and music love the central island bar and the dance floor is spacious great spot .
i could have gotten a cheeseburger off of mcdonalds dollar menu and a wendys frosty and saved myself the 10 difference would have tasted better too .
i loved this place and the next time i am in new york i will be back for sure the food is a bit spicy but i loved every bite but dont go just for the food the music is crazy oldschool hiphop at its best .
why is this place so popular fries are great but thr burgers are no better than wendys .
good spot gets lively on friday nights and they have kungfu cinema nights of wednesdays once a month i think .
that was a 5 shake oh ok not sure what makes it worth 5 even my 11 year old child was underwhelmed and complained it was too thin disappointed .
i checked in to get my free high five and smile from the bar tender he kindly gave me 2 free shots the dj mix was amazing the scene was great ill remember this place for future events .
i was here about six weeks ago take out order they messed it up called and spoke to a friendly manager was told i would get something in mail that never happened i thought the shake was great the food was good .
very cool place for 20 and 30somethings great music dj always spinning in the back happy hour starts and ends at realistic new york hours too .
average expensive burger nothin special layout terrible will not return no thanks anything higher and one star is a lie .
i came here late on a sunday afternoon for a friends birthday and couldnt ask for a better experience the beer was good but the food and the staff was even better the bartender even gave the group of us a free round of birthday shots .
95 hype 5 substance i would take an in n out burger any day over this not trying to hate but i wonder how much of the shacks initial popularity is philly people trying to swagger jack manhattan .
place was very simple happy hour is great good place to kick your night off 4 stellas till 10 the food was good too small plates .
this place is overrated the burger is small poorly put together and costs too much .
lychee mimosa try it .
usually love pei wei but tonight my noodles were a bunch of mush almost the consistency of mash potatoes and they were not really busy but we had to wait over 40 minutes smh .
great food great service by erin very attentive and friendly food was hot tasty and well presented .
service sucks brought out my meal before my soup place is empty def on the decline soup was warm chicken salad was good though so was the ice tea dont see this place staying open for many more years at this pace .
love the music here drinks are good and strong also the food is pretty good just a tad salty overall would recommend it to anyone who wants to let loose and have a good time .
waited for food for 25 mins and then received uncooked chicken fried rice nice concept but poor implementation .
i go to fat buddah for the chill vibe and awesome djs they play a perfect mix of 90s rb and chill electro to add to the awesomeness the food and drink specials are a great deal .
ordered hot and sour soup and pad thai should be pretty easy for asia place waited for 20 minutes waitress was bringing the plate with her finger in the food hot and sour soup was cold and pad thai didnt have anything in common with pad thai .
the cheers of the ev and hot crowd cant beat the happy hour in nyc 4 well wine and select beer 7 pork soy or beef buns7 wings 59 pm whatttttttttt you love fat buddha fat buddha loves you come play .
a small portion of food with highish prices my dish tasted like burnt oil which was not very appetizing they need to do better .
i can walk to this spot get cray cray drunk and walk back home awesome .
free verse poem ordered a pad thai got it to go waited 30 min whatever that means it is fresh fast forward later excited to dig in and eat it pad thai noodles no linguini i loled nothing like the pei wei in baltimoreduh .
my cheers .
all i can say is i should know better the egg roll was greasy and doughy the steak with honey sauce was coated in a sauce so thick i couldnt taste the steak next time i want chinese food i will go to a chinese restaurant my bad .
awesome happy hour with strong 4 well drinks food is delicious but a little on the expensive side 12 for a small bowl of bulgogi and rice .
hmm i paid 17 for my husband and i to eat probably the worst meal i have ever had outside of my house dont waste your money .
strong martinis yes todiefor chili fries and homemade mayo yea baby cool music get out enough light for people watch or be watched swoon happy hour absolutely yep i am a fan more martinis please .
this location needs to increase its portion size the large was way to small compared to other pei wei restaurants i have been to they also need to add the thai dynamite and spicy korean flavors that you can get at other locations .
pretty good pork buns awesome music and really nice bartenders which is so rare in this city i went for the first time last night for the nba finals and loved meeting carlos and the owner very chill place if you want to drop by on weekdays .
yuk what is this this is almost like a mcdonalized asian fast food restaurant i had dan dan noodle the noodle was extremely starchy and sticky the sauce tasted like it came from a package it was gross any cheap chinese restaurant can beat this place never again .
fat buddha has awesome music incredible wings and solid drinks i came in for happy hour a few thursdays ago and had a blast the dj was on point and the sesame ginger wings were beyond description go try them .
every time ive been here the rice is a hard as rocks and i have to complain .
where do i begin this place was just plain awesome the finger foods were amazing i had the ginger wings and dragon fries dj rocked out with classic hip hop and rb songs the lychee martinis were amazing as well definitely will be back .
how can it possibly be a pei wei without the signature pei wei pad thai dishes very disappointed no wonder the line next door at chipotle is so long people cant find what they want at pei wei .
went here on a saturday night around 930 place was full by 10 very friendly bartenders good dj a surprisingly diverse mix of people drinks were very good and worth the 10 and they have kimchi backs in addition to pickle backs .
good fried food no question however for the cost the portions of clams are ridiculously small need to find another place for whole belly clams .
in ny on business and looking for a fun place food was good and they played great music .
terrible chewy no taste lobster roll barely any lobster for the price and on hamburger bun clams with bellies had no bellies disaster got our money back and left .
i love this place happy hour until 9pm great wings great dumplings and pretty solid service just dont sit in the front or else you will be forgotten fun place to go with friends pork buns suck by the way .
nothing special i had the fish and chips my husband had the shrimp and chips everything tasted like pure oil even though the fish was fresh i will not return they even charge you for extra tartar .
food go here for brunch its amazing i loved how they blend american brunch with asian flavors the drinks are even asian inspired atmosphere barlounge they service is good the dj is playing music while u eat breakfast lol .
isnt there a food safety law that requires the handling of cooked food like the shrimp they sell to be with gloves i was a little bit grossed out when they were using bare hands to handle the cooked shrimp in addition to credit cards pens etc .
pleasantly surprised by this place we were the first reservation for saturday brunch and the food and service was great .
dreadful food has declined noticeably over the past several months we discarded most of our recent takeout as it was way too greasy and vegetables tasted rotten would not recommend at all too bad it used to be quite good .
music is great good crowd fun times food isnt all that but i can look past that for the atmosphere .
cons portions are ridiculously small felt ripped off check out my pic of 14 fish entree pros nice atmosphere food tastes ok not coming back here .
perhaps i was just drunk perhaps i was very hungry or perhaps i just didnt have any sort of high expectations for the food but boy i downed those beef slider buns like i was going to the chair clean and spacious space friendly bartenders would def return .
as with osteria it didnt really work for me noisy room ok its a brew pubwith strange unappealing menu dont come here unless you really love meat everything i tried was oversalted did i mention that a casual dinner for four ran well over 200 .
ahmazing food was awesome dj was awesome location was awesome did i mention a saturday happy hour until 9 yes please reservations are pretty difficult to snag on a saturday but we got lucky i love fat buddha .
burnt lasagna burnt coffee .
the food here was good i personally love love the appetizers awesome the atmosphere was great it had a noce ambiance to it the service was great and very attentive the drinks are really pretty and good too .
i was not impressed food was meh service was great ambiance lively and attractive .
went there for drinks and it was a good experience a nice selection of beer and other reasonably priced drinks the music was pretty loud but not obnoxious and ok as a conversation background friendly bartenders and clean comfortable atmosphere .
people behind counter have real attitudes and pizza taste similar to cardboard box 5 00 pizza not worth the arrogance .
whenever im here i have a great time the music is always fun and the bartenders treat you really well its also a fun place to catch a soccer game keep hustlin cliff .
tick tock tick tock waited a long time for our order to be taken tick tock tick tock waited a while for out food to come food was good but the wait is a bit much .
super tasty food nice staff always a pleasant experience .
first we werent served and when we were it was all burnt so went to allwood diner allwood is family friendly and gives take out .
the half price drinks til 9 lured me in to my surprise it actually had great food awesome music totally chill place to go for snak n drink highly recommend it .
have been here 3 times in last few weeks since i am here for a 3 mo work project very disappointed in service staff is unfriendly food is average and pricey dissapointed .
music and vibe was awesome and the bartenders make great drinks does get pretty crowded so get there early to claim your territory .
way too expensive lack of items on menu dead on week days i could give a 100 reasons i will never return .
great place to start the night it isnt that big so come early for a bar space the food is great especially the pork sandwiches and the wings although they are very pricey for the portion size the music on most nights has been awesome .
used to be a favorite but the prices keep going up and service going down id rather go to nutley diner .
rainy tuesday night had a few drinks bartender was great drinks were perfect thats all i could ask for thank you i will be returning on a fri or sat .
ive been here several times over the last 10 or so years and ive seen this diner go down significantly the service is slow and poor and the quality of the food has gone downhill with so many better diners in nj i dont plan on coming back .
thanks fat buddha for showing me a fun time in ny wish there was a spot in ca like this i drank till the early morning and hurt much the next day haha bye .
first timer had breakfast here found 4 strings of hair in my rt3 traffic jam supposedly one of signature dishes someone in the back had to mess with the order feeling sick with just the thought 1 star for food quality today but 5 stars for our waitress .
drinks ok didnt eat there but the atmosphere and music are dope good spot to let loose with a few drinks .
the food was too much for what they actually give you i ordered taylor burger the meat had no flavor at all the bread was completely soggy the waitress i had was very nice but the food disappointed .
good food great dj best bartender in the city p .
5 25 for a side of fries is absolutely ridiculous do they use the extra money to hire hitmen .
i love this place the music rocks and the drinks are excellent prices are more than reasonable 10 cocktails you have to try the flying buddha drink sooooo good wish there was more place to dance .
terrible food terrible service im only giving one star because they took the lobster bisque off the bill which was totally inedible never going back again .
where else can you get red bull vodkas dance and then order up some dim sum at 1am didnt really like the layout of the space but the bartenders were super nice and the dim sum was surprisingly delicious .
very disappointing ordered the lobster bisque and got imitation crab bisque krab horrible this place is not what it used to be a victim of its own celebrity .
i had a great time here uber friendly staff and not as pretentious as other places in the area loved the lychee martinis and the dj was awesome everyone was dancing love fat buddha .
nothing special crappy service .
great staff great drinks great food must get is the sliders so goooood i can eat them all night lol .
very disappointing .
not only is the food awesome but the staff is super nice they had no problem with me bringing an outside dessert for a birthday dinner i really appreciated that .
this place is popular but not my go to diner food was decent except the cole slaw was stale good portions though and price was just right .
came here once only and i liked it music hiphop gets my stamp of approval adding to my list of no frills no hassle good music spots a la sutra bob etc crowd was on the young side free coat check .
yeah yeah gets all the press yet overpriced granted it is always open and at 3 am you could do much woirse .
in manhattan for 5 nights came here for 3 nuff said .
you walk in and you see the typical jersey diner the food is bland the service is good the place definitely leaves something to be desired there are too many diners around to choose this one bottom line go somewhere else please .
great food drinks staff are super friendly .
the food was terrible cold and got both my daughter and i sick within hours worse than that i couldnt even get a manager to speak with me after 3 days of calling this place is the worst place ive ever ate at period .
must have the sliders then must have anything lychee had fries wings and chicken bowl as well all pretty good but those are musts if nothing appeals to your taste buds go for buddha he is chunky and lovable clearly he has no complaints .
nothing better then paying 16 for 2 bowls of chicken noodle soup with no chicken 2 sodas and toast pretty sure that goes against the concept of what a diner is supposed to be .
i did enjoy this place the sangria was amazing and so was the vegetable paella its extremely pricey for the neighborhood considering its in the ghetto of hartford .
totally misses the mark bland hot roast beef sandwich that would have put the donner party off lunch just cause the waitress ends each statement with an affected hon does not a diner make .
the food here is excellent the service and staff are also exceptional always a pleasure to come here .
stale fries what diner cant make fresh french fries to go with your sandwich unacceptable the sandwich was horrible too .
yeah this is one of the best restaurants on hartford period they have fantastic seafood the only problem can be the wait time good wine list .
i used to have lunch or breakfast at this diner at least three times a week until i couldnt stand the nasty servers any longer management take note send your waitresses to charm school .
jamon iberico best ham ever never had a bad meal here everything is spectacular i cant complain and love bringing people here ambiance is classy yet fun atmosphere keeps you upbeat and enjoying everything service is impeccable awesome awesome restaurant a rare jewel in the south end .
i was served rotten sour cream rotten when i told the server she took it away and never brought anything new or apologized or anything at all things happen but how it was handled not handled was upsetting .
great place to have paella food was better before this last refresh of the menu it seems like flavors were toned down a bit sangria is still good though .
not very good compared to the other local diners .
i feel like i am in espana friendly owners and great chef have been going here when i am in the hartford area for years always consistent .
its right off route 3 stick with the regular diner selections of burgers and fries avoid anything pasta because the sauce isnt great its a good place after hours during the mornings after hanging out all night and getting soup or something for breakfast .
i love the food here the portions an be small though i ordered a simple chicken dish cant remember then name but it was flavorful and filling my friend had i believe a tuna dish and there wasnt much to it i enjoyed the atmosphere and service .
blandest food in the entire u s a these people dont understand that food can be cooked with salt and pepper much less onion or garlic the only good thing that i got there was the coffee which really was pretty good .
the food is so fresh and good and the prices are very fair we usually order in for delivery and the food comes hot and pretty quickly the pizza is a family favorite and the salads are really good too .
dry ribs too much mayo in the slaw chicken just hacked up not cut properly by section of the bird no sauce on ribs either i could have dried out ribs in my own oven for a lot cheaper .
love the rigatoni and vodka sauce great cesar salad too and you can get a glass of wine .
not impressed pulled pork was dry on a portuguese roll i love portuguese rolls but it just didnt work i got sides of rice and beans and not too much flavor there either the 3 side sauces were ketchup mustard and a watery bbq sauce sorry but sorry .
ive been going here since its inception theres never a a bad anything one of the best kept secrets in the area .
very disappointing shrimp in garlic sauce is flavorless and they use cheap tiny shrimp i ordered top sirloin medium rare but it was well done and tough not a happy camper .
my boyfriend and i love this place their food is consistently good we especially are obsessed with their vodka pizza and crostini diparma out of control how good it is yumm .
gotta be honest i had food here once an it was bland i mean very bland so i wasnt particularly pleased service was nice prices were decent but the food tasted like nothing personally ill pass .
ive been ordering takeout from this place for years and they are very consistent always extremely fast when i place an order i usually head right there and food is always ready friendly staff and quality food .
spinach and garlic in tin foil with no spice no thanks go for the noodles still not great the cameras over every table are comforting though .
the nonna pizza is the best in city my wife loves the pasta fagiole always friendly service and prices are compatible with the quality of the food try the different tartufos they have for dessert .
the hostess will and has ruined the whole experience once again i feel sorry for the waiter who served us due to her being rude i refused to leave a tip smh if i could put a half a star i would .
we got a couple large subs one ham and cheese one eggplant for a party they were ready on time tasted good and didnt cost an arm and a leg im sure well order food from them again in the future .
unless youre there for karaoke avoid this place for chinese food at all cost buffet type quality at gourmet prices the inside ambience reminds me of a funeral home .
we live near fortissmo and order their pizza all the time it is great the pizza is as good as any nyc pizza shop .
very skimpy portions dishes with chicken shrimp or beef are 90 vegetables sauces lack taste and they appear to all be from the same bottle i really wanted to like this restaurant but it was bad .
very nice dinners excellent wraps sandwiches great pizza something for everyone priced right too you can take the family and not need to get a loan very comfortable atmosphere staff is excellent hustling hard working and very friendly especially lauren danny ask for them .
this place has decent food but horrible service also the prices are outrageous 3 for a pizza slice that was tiny and 18 for spaghetti and meatballs ridiculous definitely not going back ever again .
great teriyaki chicken beef shrimp or selection of two tasty quick and inexpensive .
for princeton it is not overpriced but for anywhere else it is it is ok but not that great either it does seem to be where the townies go .
great teriyaki with fresh ingredients sushi price and quality could be the best deal here .
food was terrible ambiance and decor was good and cozy the bar seemed to be fun management acknowledged deficiencies our food went back to the kitchen because it was undercooked twice low quality ingredients some food items seemed stale hopefully not expired .
my go to for a quick bite 2 for 8 595 is my go to when i dont have time to sit for fang this is a must go .
blah food was underwhelming and expensive for what was received has a pretty cool interior but bland food ensures that next time in princeton ill be going to get dinner someplace new .
love love love price was great and food was amazing my new fave lunch spot downtown .
this place is probably better for drinks and appetizers but i was in the area meeting up with an old friend so we chose winberies the salad was totally average the company was fantastic .
soon to be added to the list of downtown favorites quick convenient and clean not the widest selection to choose from compared to its sister restaurants ginza and feng but enough to satisfy the appetite with delicious food at a reasonable price .
good drinks decent food but the last time i went we saw a mouse in the dining area .
this is our second time here if you blink you will pass it wednesday was cuban day and boy was it tasty very small no frills but the food is great .
ok not great burgers are good service so so a small step above fridays .
the paninis here are delish it is the perfect amount of size if you are hungry or looking to share a delicious hot snack with someone .
great beer selection if you like expensive crafts but there are no other options bar tender upstairs was cold and rude throughout the night they played david bowie all night which isnt bad thing but how about some variety .
to die for really there isnt one thing on this menu that doesnt live up to mouth watering expectations i have no other words only downside is its cash only there is an atm but they charge you so just fyi .
i want to like this place but then i get mediocre service at the bar and i want to leave .
one of the best paninis i had ever had the proscutto was very good and the prices are nice as well will definately come back .
i went here for brunch on sunday i sat down and ordered a cup of coffee the waiter informed me that they do not serve coffee i thought he was joking but he informed me that he was not i left .
delicious paninis ordered for lunch so huge i ate 12 the next day i had the p17 imported prosciutto with fontina panini with red onions fresh basil and extra virgin olive oil on whole wheat cant wait to order again .
ah not worth the money or the wait for a flavorless burrito that may or may not have hair in it .
great place we always order from here at my job when we have our staff meetings i prefer their paninis over anyone elses in this neighborhood this place is a must if you love paninis .
gross worth driving to new haven for pizza with decent sauce my whole family was ill an hour after eating here coincidence considering how filthy and dusty and gross the place is probably not .
ordered p18 today for delivery it was delicious a but salty but crunchy flavorful and filling love the pesto just right for lunch also tried half of the p29 it was ok but i didnt like the whole wheat bread def recommend p18 with regular ciabatta bread .
you could starve here while staring at the wait staff as they lean elbows on the counter looking out the window .
they have delicious paninis nutella crepes the outdoor seating is great and its bring your own wine what more can you ask for you have to try the pastrami swiss pickles mustard on an everything panini its to die for .
super inconsistent depending on the staff available pretty great when its thriving feels like a hidden camera tv show when it isnt .
used to be one of my favorite little secrets but it looks like everyone found out never will you be disappointed by the well constructed sandwiches or salads good food good service an oasis in an otherwise quiet stretch of brooklyn barren of quality establishments .
i cant believe they have a vegan menu and also serve foie gras that makes no sense to me foie gras should be illegal to make and serve shame on them .
great paninis soups snd salads this place delivers awesome nutella crepes also and not expensive .
portions on some of the small plates were almost non existent pricey for the quality and quantity of food .
i order from here all the time great food great coffee really nice staff .
my favorite lunch place in philly with amazing cheesesteaks for some reason took cheesesteaks off the menu that decision deserves one star .
best place in bensonhurst love everything nothing has disappointed me yet i plan on eating here on the regular .
honestly the sandwich tasted great my only issue is the lack of meat my god for 10 there was barely any meat just filler onions mushrooms and that big ole hot pepper in the fire steak im not the least bit happy .
the food is delicious panini was so savory crepe was scrumptious nutella and strawberry is a must have i just moved here and im going to live in this place tonight im trying a salad .
italian pork sandwich was ok i thought the pork was a bit dry though garlic bomb is a very boring sandwich to me nothing surprising but fills up the stomach .
panino not only has a wonferful and welcoming staff they have the best crepes and the best coffee brewed to perfection i had their turkey crepe it was savory with just the right amount of creamy basil dressing arugula and fontina cheese warm and deliciously cheesey yum .
sandwiches were ok i dont have a very strong stomach so i couldnt really handle the full on pig being butchered right in front of me as i paid at the register we got two sandwiches and only are half of both .
love this place amazing ppl and great food under one roof you can bring your own wine sit outside enjoy an expresso and the cheese platter is amazing my bf and i love going their if you want a great vive with great food this is it .
eh go to paesanos .
one of the most underrated sandwich spots in the area i recommend the p20 cant give five stars because the service certainly isnt anything to boast about .
huh average at best pizza was nothing memorable .
cute cafe i ordered the salmon avocado panini the salmon was very fresh i think adding some cream cheese instead of goat would be better for me though the one flaw is its a small cafe so when the staff are using the blender its really loud .
maggie moores shut down this week .
had p25 grilled chicken smoked mozzarella sun dried tomato panini the sandwich was pretty good and i loved the bread you have to get the creamy basil dressing on the side it is soooo good .
just ok .
another great meal smoked salmon panino with goat cheese avocado and red onions great beef barley soup also .
just another mediocre local sushi joint too focused on strange combo rolls and not enough attention paid to quality fish .
the food was terrific and there were so many choices i had the chicken with goat cheese avocado and balsamic glaze it was delicious we will definitely be back .
dont eat at this place while waiting 15 minutes to get a simple menu saw a mouse running across the floor we quietly stood up and left there was no soap in the bathroom if the customers are not washing hands nor is the sushi chef .
delucious squisito consistently delicious paninis the p18 is my fave ordering sometimes takes a bit of time however during the arctic blast we had this week they allowed me to order under the minimum so i did not have to leave my house very kind .
good service but bad food .
good spot in bensonhurst food and coffee are both decent but finally a spot in bensonhurst that we can finally enjoy .
its overpriced and not worth for vegetarians but the service and the ambience is good .
i love this place i always order off grub hub whenever i get a chance and their food never fails to amaze my taste buds they are not pricy because of the quality of the food the food is healthy and taste fresh try their paninis .
this place wants to be trendy and special but it fails miserably service was average food was horrible made me throw up after leaving the place something was clearly wrong with the food after six weeks i am still waiting for the partial refund they promised .
we love this place been there a few times and always enjoyed the food service and atmosphere i would definitely recommend this spot .
the sushi portions were way too small and our firecracker shrimp appetizer was bland and boring the quality of the food is lacking for the prices they charge horrible experience overall do yourself a favor and stay away .
hooray for panino rustico my coworkers and i often order delivery from here because their paninis are fresh plentiful and delicious they always get our orders right and delivery is quick and efficient .
really beautiful place good service ok prices sushi was average at best good happy hour .
very good place to get great tasting salads creeps and paninis amazing so happy this place is the neighborhood .
horrible atmosphere and mediocre food especially for the price .
i loved their food overall i usually have their panini which is pretty big i think they are closed on sunday which is a bummer .
pure crap over priced and the quality stinks .
polite and good service check good price for portion ratio check outside dining check cash only dinein doesnt bother me delicious food check 4 5 stars definitely will be making multiple trips back here .
eeek when a restaurant says is closes at 2 then gives its potential customers an attitude for trying to have a drink at 1130 either officially change your hours or suck it up and stay open impure .
delicious panini and nice outdoor seating .
unclean conscienceless unkind etc just you better dont go there .
first time here and i must say it was delicious i was definitely surprised how unique it tasted especially the way the salmon was cooked in a good way the bread was very crunchy just the way i liked it .
saturday closed stopped by at 2pm the doors were locked and the chairs were on the tables time to update the website .
havent been to their actual location but they are def one of my grubhub faves nom nom .
owner is very rude he refused to serve some of our friends because some of us were wearing patriots jerseys very unprofessional and the hotdogs are just average .
we just moved to bensonhurst and our first day at our new apartment i decided to order lunch from here panini for him salad for me they were both incredibly delicious and delivery quickly by a nice man enough said eat here .
the hot dogs are horrible zero stars i got a burger which was pretty good my daughter got a hot dog took 1 bite and wouldnt eat it i took a bite and threw it in the trash for a hot dog specialty place dont go .
so yummy on a saturday around 1230 place was 80 percent full the salmon with goat cheese avocado and truffle oil was so delicious and i like the nutella and strawberry crepe affordable and delicious will be back friendly staff .
not a good experience hot dogs were covered with toppings and overwhelmed everything which led me to believe what are they hiding love man vs food but adam got this place wrong .
im a fan of their smoked salmon panini .
its a glorified hot dog stand owners response to my comment is below what were you expecting fine linen and silver ware smuck showing customer service class and how small minded they truly are .
amazing place sometimes i order from here 2x a day .
cute place but the macaroon i got the other day tasted like it had been sitting out for too long sorta conjured up the taste of shredded gym shoe soles .
5 stars hands down for finally finding a place that serves the perfect panini and does not serve sandwiches like other panini imposters i have tried the mortadella goat cheese and arugula panini would awaken a dead libido im sure the iced frappe is phenomenal just go .
food was awful eggs were burnt potatoes were not good and the salad was super tiny drinks were okay but i would definitely pass on eating here staff was nice but overwhelmed and busy go for drinks but not for food .
great place for a quick lunch great food great service a must try .
dropped in for just a coffee and wont be back if you like your coffee bitter and burnt this is your spot .
this was my first time here had the grilled chicken panini and was very impressed food was fresh and the bread was delicious .
never been to an italian place where thy deny you more bread pizza is burnt staff is slow and unfriendly foods overpriced .
this place is a hidden gem not only are their paninis incredible the smoked salmon panini o m g but the staff are so incredibly friendly and they deliver too .
mango milkshake was nothing to write home about .
p20 absolute heaven the ingredients were incredibly fresh and the pesto was perfection the restaurant is adorable and pristine totally worth the trip from manhattan i will definitely be back .
the food is decent but the customer service is seriously lacking ive eaten here like 30 times and the owners still act as though they dont know who i am kinda weird the milkshakes are delicious .
i went here for lunch today the sandwich i had was great and the dressing on the salad was even better wish i knew what it was so i could make it for myself the waitstaff were very friendly too bensonhurst could use more eateries like this one .
bland and not so hot for veg options ive given them a few shots and every time im disappointed by a soup whose broth tastes more like the schuylkill than any pho ive ever had head for vientienne instead .
this little corner spot is totally awesome the food is yum and the service is excellent .
waiting nearly ten mins before leaving due to the servers lack of interest in making money place is also dated and in need of a deep clean as it smells a bit funky .
amazing food by far the best panni i every had i drive reguarly from staten island to brooklyn just for a panni my favorite is the smoked salmon panni ive loved everything i tried there .
the bartender never checked to see how our food was and left us with empty glasses for a while felt completely ignored he was too busy playing dice with his loud drunk friends .
so glad i found these guys bottom line great paninis awesome crapes and above all great friendly service i love seeing new small business take pride in their craft and they do so here have been here 3 times already and it has been consistanntly good .
not good do not waste your money a lot of money by the way only thing that was half way decent was the desert .
decent takeout general tsos crab rangoon boneless spare ribs beef lo mein etc all appear to be pretty reliable lady answering the phone comes across as very curt so if you can deal with that its worth a try .
i have to say that i was not that impressed the original pizza was loaded with cheese overkill the grandma was decent but was really skeeved out when the pizza man let out a huge burp .
best chinese food around every time i order chinese food i go to this place great service the lady is sweet speak some english not much the food is really good everytime i get it .
worst place ever food all changed with new owner someone should teach chef how to cook bad saturday tell chef to cook garlic it was white and raw in my shrimp .
my go to place on grubhub i have fallen hard for their pan fried noodles and szchcuen wontons .
fast service for delivery food is typical pizza place food not amazing but mediocre and fine if your hungry and not trying to spend a lot one time i found a staple in my soup and almost lost it i guess that could happen anywhere right .
love this place quick and easy chinese takeout they do a brisk business so food doesnt sit and it always seems pretty fresh .
pizza sandwiches are good guy at the front wants to tow my car before i pick up my order dont know what thats about i guess they want you to pickup your order by bicycle but they dont have any bike racks .
six of us dined at the restaurant on a monday at 430 p m service was courteous and prompt the food was very good and plentiful we all enjoyed our meal the restaurant is large and very clean highly recommend .
dog food terrible quality terrible service so many other places for italian .
sushi is always fresh chefs are awesome i like it .
bland food and slow staff pasta sauce was watery even the salad was lack luster .
koto is always yummy i love getting a crew together and enjoying their hibachi they are very popular on the weekends but the place is so big there are never long waits its always an awesome group night out with friends .
nothing special with all of the great italian restaurants in the area why would you come here the calamari was chewy the sauce was bland the chicken parm was obviously reheated save your money .
best hibachi in new hampshire the filet melts in tour mouth and the chefs are very friendly .
meh thats all i can say service was slow food was even slower and my family had stomach issues for a few days after enough said .
doesnt compare to bennihana but the food and atmosphere were good 100 for two was a little pricey and the drinks were weak but overall if i had an extra cnote in my pocket that i dont know what to do with id probably go back .
when you get a good pie its awesome but otherwise just another pizza from jersey i loved this place growing up but something has changed and quality has paid the price .
a pretty typical hibachi place the food is good but a little greasy and fairly expensive but like i said typical hibachi .
yet another pizza joint in boonton there is a lot of competition and this one falls really really really short go to pasquales or top of the park .
great food huge portions petty cheap spaghetti sauce was kinda blah garlic knot were bomb hero was great delivery was 4ever but i tried it on grubhub embed up calling and talking to an employee who appologized made of worth it .
charge for deliveries chicken look fishee no good food charge to much for what is this place to much bread in general tsos chicken no good at all .
one of my favorite spots i like the decor and the wings are the best the daily campur is a mixed offering and although not a large portion its great to share and try a few different things .
i am not commenting on their food cuz the phone girl was super rude and that made me doesnt want to order any food from them .
this place is a great greenpoint secret the dishes are exotic fresh and pretty delicious brunch here is always magical .
a great place to eat poorly made food service zero its a buffet food is greasy and alway leaves me feeling used .
lovely atmosphere and super friendlyhelpful service the food is delicious and although you might think the portions are small at first they are truly just right love this place .
waitress was a bitch we were trying to get our money together for the bill and she kept reminding us that the tip isnt included in the fee well that ruined her getting a tip at all .
my favorite local haunt super tasty inspired food cozy clean interior hospitable attentive staff easy on the eyes to boot and be sure to get dessert the panna cotta creme brulee and ice cream are all delicious .
for gourmands only if you want average tasting food go at dinner time when there is high volume and then pick your dishes judiciously needs to train the staff and clean the place better i only go here when my friends want to go .
moved to the area in july and ive been here 4 times already one of the best brunch is good and so is dinner even nice for just a quick drink .
i ordered the churrasco and a pupusa and it was completely flavorless .
delicious restaurant great service try out the bali urap salad and the market fish curry they also have expresso and affogato a typical italian ice cream and coffe .
good food but rude customer service inquired about an item and couldnt hear the first time cause i was mumbled to so i asked again and was practically screamed at .
really excellent new flavors for us nice atmosphere great service do try you wont be disappointed .
prepare for extreme slow service specially when dining outside otherwise food at a good price .
had papaya salad fish cakes and market fish curry all delicious not too heavy good selection of bottled beer ciders and wines small but good selection of draft beer service was on point .
8 for 90min dogfish food was okay atmosphere is okay has tvs i guess good for the island .
wonderful representation of indonesia excellent simply plain white athmosphere brings positive energy in the dimly lit dining room and it s cleaaaan i am happy .
it was ok .
beautiful bright crisp and friendly the atmosphere is enough to keep me coming back but luckily the food is amazing too i highly recommend the black rice porridge for breakfast and the nasi goreng for dinner .
had a good time and was slammed with a tip charge sneaky tactic even after we left a good tip so check your bill when eating here .
great curries made with fresh highquality ingredients and a perfect espresso bar .
the food is fair but the service is generally bad if you arent a known regular i recommend to go into midtown and go to one if the hundreds of other bars .
great addition to the neighborhood i visited indonesia a couple years ago and crave healthy hearty meals so happy to have this place so near my home thank you selamat pagi .
i stopped ordering food from this place specially the roast chicken the vegetables were so passé they were practically rotten everything else is also disappointing too bad .
absolutely love this place ive been several times for both brunch and dinner and it never disappoints some favorites are the nasi goreng crispy chicken beef rendang and finish with the ice cream the flavors here are just incredible .
nice interior thats actually quite authentic im english slow slow service and filled with suited men urgh really drinks were horrible bad wine horrible cask beer check came to 25 for 2 drinks never would go back .
fantastic service and food the waiter was very nice and it was all very interesting and new i would definitely go there again .
overrated service decent beer decent food decent seating was uncomfortable cockroach stalking my date not cool .
mmmmm delicious brunch on saturday my favorite part was how subtle and fresh and simple everything was lovely design as well all very clean and uplifting and refreshing im definitely a fan and i cant wait to go back to try dinner .
used to frequent here something has changed over the last 6 months ordered a grilled chicken greek wrap they forgot the chicken quality of food is low and prices are high the delivery man is scary and yells in multiple languages whats going on here oh well .
great and fresh and original and sweet and cute and i recommend the appetizers all of them .
i usually write something clever or funny but not this time god awful do yourself a favor and go to wethersfield pizza house this place sucks .
five stars food is delicious place is awesome the van leeuwens are a brooklyn treasure get into it .
violently ill from the food there on one occasion extremely over priced never ever again dont bother .
great new restaurant i will definitely be coming back here soon everything was delicious the bali fish salad was a great way to start followed by the succulent beef rendang and finished with van leeuwens trio of ice cream what a night .
horrible have been in town and given them 2 tries worst tonight i paid 24 95 for a steak she said was 13oz lies i asked foe medium i got well done and cold because th 45 minutes i was told turned into 1 12 hours .
awesome place to stop by for any thing big breakfast plate its great there bagels are out standing egg bacon and lox all day service is really friendly outstanding .
rude service crammed tables mediocre food no substitutions on the menu not even easy ones furniture and tableware in bad condition dirty bathroom yuck not going back .
mom n pop family owned business where you get that home made sandwiches made by mom feeling great alternative to your regular assembly line sandwich factory coffee is always freshly brewed and bagels baked each morning staff is also very friendly and remembers their regulars .
really below average food i cant understand the hype everything is lacking salt flavor i went for dinner did the mezze platter we did share a really nice salad with a pistachio crusted goat cheese that was perfectly done but everything served after that was a huge disappointment .
ive tried this place a couple times and its always good ive had the breakfast and ellis island bagels and they are really filling not skimpy on what goes in them also they have always been really friendly .
ehh dont know what the fuss is about bad service and okay fresh food but nothing special definitely not worth the wait at brunch .
stopped in for a burger and fries for lunch today food was tasty staff was very friendly service was quick and price was great cant beat that looking forward to trying their bagels next time im in the area .
i went here once and the food was barely edible yuck never again .
i stopped in for a sausage egg and cheese on an everything bagel i was really craving a good breakfast sandwich and this place delivered fluffy bagels and everything is done made to order and served hot really nice guy and woman behind the counter ill be back .
bland .
very good bagels love the egg bagel sandwich must come back for a lunch sandwich coffee cappuccino machines .
food was ok but nothing special did not like the couscous dishes which were more like a stew with too much liquid the appetizers were better .
great place to hit in the morning coffee and bagels are great and if youre there at lunch time have one of their sandwiches you wont be disappointed love their roast beef great service nice local business much better than any chain .
i dont like this place it is not expensive it is the only positive thing decor is not attractive food is dry and not tasty staff seems new all the time dont recommend it .
best sandwiches in the whole wide world .
im not tolerant of shotty service the last time i was here i got tomato sauce from the crispy dough poured all over me they did nothing to relieve the situation had to ask for napkins .
i love this place the food is amazing and so are the people that work there they always do everything in their power to make their customers happy .
they have an interesting take on chicken shawarma that i go back for its middle eastern takes on upper class the place is a little too dim especially on a bright sunny day the atmosphere inside is catered towards a cold winter night .
food is really good with great personal service and simple atmosphere go to this restaurant if you want to be around true philadelphians .
there were magots in my latte lots of magots i drank them the manager laughed it sucked its too bad i used to g there a lot i think that is too big of a violation for me to ever go there again check everything .
spinach homemade meatballs provolone omelette this place is awesome friendly welcoming we will be coming back this is great italian family place loved it so much .
awful customer service so rude they made it seem like it was my fault that they gave me a shrimp roll instead of a spring roll im allergic to shrimp .
like cheers for the breakfast crowd of this south philly neighborhood always great food always entertaining easy to get lost in a long breakfast talking to the crowd that gathers here .
if you want really good sushi go somewhere else but the chinese is pretty good the prices are decent i order take out every now and again just be prepared to wait an hour for your food .
food decent for a lunch place mozz sticks really werent good at all sometimes i go there there out of things but ill say it again place has decent food good place to go for a nice small breakfast lunch great service and workers friendly nice .
greasy pizza and very very slow delivery .
i absolutely love this place the south philly atmosphere is so inviting and the food is great and homemade the meatballs are great try anything on the menu and introduce yourself .
south whitney pizza is not good the pizza and the dough especially taste like it came from the hot lunch line in public school the bathroom was dirty and there was no soap in the dispenser .
lovely we just move to the area and while walking around find this lil corner place its like being home there the ownersoperators are the nicest the food is great the atmosphere is welcoming and everybody is friendly nothing is fancy its just simple and great .
nasty greasy pizza yuck double yuck .
holy crap awesome spot tiny lunch bar with what might be a small dining area in the back best meatball hoagie ive had in my life hanks sodas too super reasonable prices i cant wait to go for breakfast .
i never really liked the pizza here i found it bland and greasy and overpriced .
make sure to unlock free dumplings offer but do it in front of the waiter very delicious not the americanized type of chinese food the real deal highly recommend spicy on menu is super spicy so be careful .
this place is nasty and the meat is cooked hard they dont wear hair nets or rubber gloves when handling food the people are rude and nasty .
love this place everytime i go i am never disappointed with the good they stopped being byob which is really disappointing i would say its comparable to han dynasty but closer and with out the wait for a table .
subpar at best if you are looking for good sandwiches in the area i suggest mazzantis in bristol or any primos location .
this was first time eating in chinatown and by far this was the best chinese food i have ever had everything was delicious .
enjoyed this place until my umbrella was stolen while waiting during the lunch employees were unhelpful in assisting me in tracking down the culprit s will not return .
so far the best place to get hotpot you get so much for what you are paying and they even let you take the left overs home with you .
at present this chinese takeout joint uses only gf soy sauce they have gf rice noodle dishes and fried rice but there can be a language barrier to it helps to bring a dining card if you want to check on something .
legit family owned chinese restaurant in the heart of philadelphias chiantown food quality is excellent its on the spicy side though there was only two other nonasian people there which was a good sign notably they dont serve a lunch special on the weekend .
terrible terrible i mist be missing something here i ask for spaghetti bolognese and get meatballs on top of pasta wtflippers and chunks of pork what im disappointed oh and rude wait staff not returning .
4 rivers was my go to restaurant for spicy food but this is my new love lol i love this place .
id rather eat my brothers ass .
authentic szechuan cuisine you can tell by their peppercorns and the numbness of the mouth afterwards this place is a good break from most of the fast service places in the area also they have ktv if you like to sing .
nothing about this place is impressive the food was mediocre well it sucked thats about all i remember wont go back .
authentic chinese food i go back for their ma po tofu all the time service and environment are decent .
the pizza is absolute garbage and the people who actually have the balls to serve it to you should be fucking ashamed of themselves they should take that tip jar they have on the take out counter and insert it in there fucking asses .
i like e mei restaurant my friend recommended this place and now i strongly recommend it to you to be honest e mei restaurant is the most unforgettable part of my trip to philadelphia .
the pizza is super doughy the sauce is disturbingly sweet about the only edible thing on the menu is the white pie .
this place is great stopped in for lunch after a recommendation from a friend had the chongqing spicy chicken griddle pork ribs and beef with long hots everything was very tasty and appropriately spicy better than han as far as im concerned .
i read the reviews and thought we should try it out meatballs were blan the lobster ravioli special was nothing special at all and service was fair plenty of better italian places on s i .
great variety veggie steamed dumplings were awesome lamb entree and scallops great very relaxed atmosphere when there are more non english speaking patrons you know you are in the right palace for chinese food they dont skimp on the spices our new favorite .
huge disappointment drove all the way here i made sure of the hours and it locked up and no answer guess ill never know .
so good！ recommend fish fillet in hot and spicy sauce！！！ i came here twice and i love it so much！！ .
will never order from here again i use to love this place until i found a roach in my wonton soup a large nasty roach in my soup .
i always enjoy the food here especially shredded pork .
beware see pic above that does not look like hair from the head this was in my boneless spare rib lunch special dont order from this place .
went there with two friends both italian excellent food i especially liked the spicy chicken but the pepper steak was good too also portions are generous for the price .
super cute cafe great atmosphere but the food was so slow to arrive others were complaining asking where their food was food was nice enough but not worth the money or wait .
chinese chicken nuggets braised pork belly everything here is great you really cant go wrong unless you start ordering all the american chinese food like beef n broc or sesame chicken but then again that stuff is probably delicious as well .
pretty much your prototypical hipster coffee shop replete with all of the cookiecutter wereliketotallybetterthanlikemainstream­starbucks attitude .
good spicy chinese food bring the heat .
food is good 75 of the time my drink is forgotten and another driver has to be sent out .
i am so in loved with this restaurant this is def one of my favorites come here all the time .
the store advertises that they open at noon on sundays i was there at 1215 and not a soul was in the store the lights were off and the door was locked .
really good food cant wait to go back again and order so more yummy dishes .
ordered wings and asked for half barbeque half teriyaki they give us a bag with the bottom filled with a teriyakibbq soup and the wings themselves were soggy and the mixed up flavor unrecognizable .
the hot pot is really good the water boiled beef is good and everything else i tried has been good .
wings were bland and wait was wayyy too long for take out counter guy was rude too wont go back .
yummmmyyy the dishes are spicy and delicious prob one of my favorite restaurants now love the variety if dishes they offer if you love spicy like i do definitely worth it try .
it wasnt downright bad but at some point someone is going to have to explain to me why anyone would wait in line for this simply mediocre pizza total disappointment service was excellent though .
yum yum yum my friend and her aunt and uncle came here for a late lunch this past sunday and the szechuanstyle cuisine satisfied both our hunger and our palates yay for leftovers .
a new haven institution but why ive had better pizza at pizza hut surly service never again .
emai always has a ton of food ive been there a few times now and love how spicy the dishes are service is sometimes slow depending on how busy it is but they have some great dumplings also pretty sure its byob which is sweet .
nasty toppings including frozen spinach i just dont get the fuss harrys in west hartford is a million times better .
lamb with cumin yummy .
i feel that everyone in ct knows about pepes pizzas well it is overrated pizzas are ok not good not bad nothing unique because of the excessive reputation of the restaurant there is always a 2030 min waiting line it is not worth it .
been here a few times now and its got some authentic szechuan dishes the doublecooked pork is especially tasty as they use garlic leafs and cured pork to make it the right way to make it in my opinion also try the lamb dry hotpot amazing .
they live solely off their reputation pricy brick oven pizzas come out burnt on the bottoms burnt and inedible the clam pies are very salty and smaller compared to other pies that are supposed to be the same size staff need serious attitude adjustment .
great authentic chinese food stick to the traditional menu with the authentic chinese dishes and you will be fine if you enjoyed han dynasty this is more of the authentic version of it the schezuan style dishes are simply awesome and would highly recommend this place .
the pie was fine but the service was abysmal and openly hostile with so many pizza options in new haven youd think at least one restaurant would want to distinguish itself from the rest through its helpful or friendly staff .
tasty and huge portions really oily though but i guess thats ok if its your thing .
too long a queue for cue slower than fette sau actually brisket was good sausages are decent ribs not so much on a lazy slow saturday its worth checking out otherwise pass .
best resturant at chinatown my favorites spciy hot noodle sliced beef in chill sauce pickled peppers chicken hot and sour potato slik jean belly and stired beef .
tried brisket and beef rib huge rib good but the brisket was way better try that not a fan of the beans and potato salad mac and cheese was pretty good though .
fantastic food awesome service very glad i checked yelp .
was excited to try especially since a texan transplant recommended it to us pulled pork sandwich was dry brisket and potato salad was delish beans arent my thing but definitely unique .
food was good service was good a bunch of asian ppl there the second u walk in only a few of the servers speak english but other then dat everything was great .
waited in line the guy comes back 5 min after telling they re closed for the next 10 minutes make up your mind when you wanna take a cigarette break dont waste people s time your service sucks ass .
fun place to go and get a hot pot with friends .
came here after reading reviews arrived at 9pm on sunday and three main smoked meats were already sold out very disappointed way too much vinegar in the collard greens the meats for tender but way overpriced .
the best chinese restaurant in chinatown the food is really good and fast and tasty and reasonable pricing what else is to ask for .
went there for breakfast this morning had pancetta hash way too salty small and really not worth the price people who worked there not the friendliest bunch can you say attitude with all the other places on passyunk ill be going elsewhere .
solid chinese food .
we left before eating after a mouse ran across the floor .
oh the smell of chili oil as you walk in that delcious savory msg flavor this place is delicious compared to philly stuff i am a los angeles food snob and therefore 5 stars so good tad expensive but not too bad overall .
i heard that the original owners moved which makes complete sense because now the food for the most part is over priced they changed the bread portions are small and the sandwiches are not consistent the old owners were great new ones not so much .
spicy and delicious if youre in a chinatownrestaurantrut like i was give this place a shot order their chongqing sp chicken youll be happy .
really good place to eat but is always crowded i made a reservation but when i arrived i had to wait for 40 minutes .
food is spicy and cheap decently authentic i like it and will come back again .
third time not a charm very good in the past two months not tonight four different dinners equally disappointing tasteless food needs seasoning and flavor there was none to be found we went there with expectations we left with disappointment ps the service equalled the food .
its a great place for spicy food nice and clean but very pricy .
didnt stay for the food unfortunately so loud and noisy couldnt hear ourselves talk .
service was excellent food is amazing certainly a favorite from chinatown clean and tasty .
nothing really to write home about .
the service and food are both exceptional thanks for making my friends 21st birthday so memorable special shoutout to ah zheng who provided excellent food suggestions helped with the cake and candles and was generally just an awesome human being .
rude rude rude staff i will never step foot into mercato even if you paid me .
i like their lunch special a lot just go you will know what i am talking about by the way the boss is super friendly .
food took forever no time to eat it had to rush to atm to pay cash only maybe if we had brought wine we could have stood it hope the kitchen staff enjoyed our leftovers which were plentiful .
this is my current fave chinese restaurant in chinatown everything is always tasty and service is usually good love the kung pao chicken fish filet in spicy sauce squash cold chicken appetizer beef and tripe .
wings are drier than sand and very pricey place is dirty in appearance and the staff is very unfriendly .
this place is amazing hummus is so so good portions are kind of small but the taste and good service makes up for it will go back so good .
swings was always ok archies is better by far i say that the best late night place to grub on some wings is the new wings over new haven dont get me wrong swings is good but i would rather go elsewhere .
love this place reasonably priced delicious and somehow unique mediterranean flood you can go causal with dips and sides crazy baba is crazy good or go all out with robust entrees nice house wine and great service every time .
worst drivers ever dude wont even get out of the car and opened and ate one of my wings so grossed out never again .
amazing amazing amazing delicious delicious delicious the best middle was term vegetarian friendly good in nyc the food is to die for and have a ton of vegetarian options the staff is friendly and quick i highly recommend for a first date anniversary or special occasion .
certainly not the best wings ever especially completely sober but they do hit the spot when there arent many other options the regular fries are delicious okay ordered for the last time a few months back and they smelled very badly i almost vomited never again .
fantastic food everything we ate was amazing chillcozy atmosphere friendly staff cowshuka was excellent .
awful pizza i just dont understand why anybody in montclair would go here for pizza there are so many better options .
stumbled upon this gem of a restaurant while exploring williamsburg amazing all around from the presentation to the service atmosphere and to the taste of course you have to go do not miss out on this experience .
pizza very doughy food is just ok .
zizi gabors restaurant shes dead but this place bears her name and just like her character on green acres this place is mediterranean and sexy as fuck go here just saying .
the pizza was ok the service was terrible .
i love this place a great set of foods that you can share or just order your own dish friendly staff nicely prepared food and comfy environment i strongly recommend and yes you can bring mom and dad there .
pizza is great went there for dinner and had the chicken balsamico and it was gross sad cause the last two time i been there the food was great but this wa drowning in brown sauce so gross .
talented chef menu that pleases everyone vegetariansvegans and carnivores and its really reasonably priced i cant say enough good things about this place ive been here a few times and have had consistently wonderful dinners .
nothing outstanding or likable about the food here the pizza is ehhhh the chicken parm was bland the highlight was the friendly staff .
really great service the food was delicious and the atmosphere super laid back the kids enjoy it too .
enzos across the street is much better there are onion chunks under the cheese yuck bad sauce too .
nicest staff and delicious food .
a few months ago friend and i had a couple pieces of the pepperoni pie and antipasto salad unfortunately soon after leaving experienced bad case of diarrhea friend tried the place again recently and got sick after no thanks .
absolutely delicious wild salmon and short ribs were complex and perfectly cooked earthy perfectly cooked liver with crispy flavorful asparagus .
chefs specialty roast duck noodles edible but these folks need to be in a different line of work for sure .
some of the best middle eastern food food ive ever had theres a weird desert that looks like shredded chicken worth it if you saved room .
the usual chinese fare at the usual prices and with the usual amount of sauce salt and flavor .
this is an amazing spot in williamsburg highly recommend .
its been a while but i went here once on a whim and just found it to be soso 2 5 star if anything i just remember it being dark and the food was bland .
great dishes plenty of different flavors explode into your mouth nice atmosphere and decoration service is good too music is a bit loud at night we have been to this restaurant twice and will definitely come back more often .
worst service ever took forever to prepare the order for to go food is worst dont go .
good food good service .
ordered take out from this place chicken was dark meat and tasted horrible my wife got the dosa which she said was ok .
i love this little place the food is delicious and authentic great service and vibe .
very average food not a great buffet spread the curries tasted bland desserts were just ok small place so service was not an issue .
the food was delicious i liked the shawarma better than the cowchuka the service was friendly but the food took too long to come out .
reuben was solid but nothing amazing and didnt fill me up definitely not worth 11 or a special trip also the homemade lemonade was crap from instant mix .
prob one of my most favorite restaurants i usually dine here few times a week great atmosphere and friendly staff the shef is a great guy and has a funny personalty i love the midetrenian cuisine highly recommending this place .
im upset with this place today waited in line for 15 minutes only to be told that theyre out of corn beef who does that davids brisket house apparently not happy with them today .
israelimiddle eastern food taken to the next level sophisticated with a lot of soul ambience is relaxed service is friendly all in all great for brunch dinner date or just hanging out for a beer .
ordered the brisket and was served a plate of fat sure i know brisket isnt the leanest cut but their brisket is repulsive expensive and awful .
great atmospherelove that its not overly crowded or loud food is very good but im bummed they took the mackerel nicoise off the menu .
tried the brisket wasnt crazy about it its as if i had gone into some hipsters ironic restaurant of averageness and ordered a sandwich ill give them one more try but i wasnt impressed .
wow the food was excellent best hummes i ever had in ny .
probably only good if you get the real italian food dont even cook entirely in olive oil my sisters salmon was grey .
really good food and good atmosphere will def go there again .
good food nice atmosphere but felt very rushed came in at 630 and felt rushed out by 730 by 8pm it was clear we had overstayed our welcome this overshadowed the meal .
buenisimo just order random stuff you will like everything .
its pretty hit or miss if youll get a good waitresswaiter or a good drink have gotten margaritas there before that were just sour mix .
came here with some friends for a meal on a friday night and it was delicious great friendly wait staff very small and quaint restaurant very filling and tasty food just need a few more cocktails on the menu .
if you want to grab a drink this is the place to go good atmosphere and delicious margaritas but if you want to eat good quality mexican food i dont recommend margaritas food is very very blend .
finally a straight forward mediterranean kitchen which is unpretentious and doesnt try to be something that is not stuffed cigars ox tail burkeas artichoke yogurt semolina cake were all amazing highly recommended .
very mediocre food and the service is hit or miss margaritas are very good and are probably what keeps them in business for what they are doing they should be doing it better .
holy awesomeness yigal was such a helpful and welcoming manager i felt like i was a friend from the moment i got there the food is oh so delicious my favorite was the cigars yummmmmm and no meat i will be back again and again .
paid a cover sat down ordered a drink and then we were asked to move from the table smelled in there .
comfortable environment great service delicious fresh reasonably priced food ive never met a falafel i liked until i came here ive been here twice and ordered delivery once every experience has been great .
this place is pretty lame except for the drink specials why do all of the bars in montclair end up being exactly the same mediocre all the way around .
great food affordable great service and nice atmosphere what more could you want the passion fruit cocktail was amazing as was the gravlax appetizer the beet salad the shakshuka the shishito peppers the tahini the everything we got .
pros good beer selection good burger great steak fingers mets bar outdoor seating cons potato pancakes are actually tater tots slow poor service hard roll for burger seated at the stage with no other tables around felt like i was on display .
been to zizi limona many times get that falafel tershi baba gravlax 3 small zis is where its at atmosphere is chill bathroom is crazy nice .
we had a big party so we were seated in the back but apparently the drink specials cant be served in the back wth the food was nothing special the service was horrible it took the waitress forever to bring us utensilsplates and just one glass of water .
this place is amazing .
terrible service stressful atmosphere servers constantly shoving meat in your face one even dropped a piece of greasy meat on my khakis food was solid but did not make up for the hectic atmosphere and poor service never again .
so far ive had a kabob sandwich moroccan sub and the chicken shwarma sandwich all have been extremely tasty lots of unique smokey flavors delicious and more creative than your average middle eastern cuisine also try the house made hot sauce .
the burgers were so dry i could through them on a wall and the pizza was nothing to brag about prob give them a try in the far future .
came here for brunch after everything else was too mobbed or closed on new years day super friendly staff and delicious pita bread .
there are very slow had a 20 min before show stop by and order cappuchino 12 minutes waited for my order was very upset .
i ordered from zizi limona for dinner home fries falafel shawarma delicious so glad to find good food for delivery in williamsburg everything is always just okay or just plain bad zizi is a very welcome addition to the local scene yum .
foods good portion sizes are way too small for the price especially for brunch plus no free refills on coffee is kind of annoying .
head chef nir mesika who hails from top restaurants in tel aviv and milan has transcended the scope of any single culture by blending the flavors of israel italy algeria and greece a must try .
sadly my chicken was ddddrrrryyyy overcooked scant sauce and under seasoned eggs were baked to death wine pours were minimal boring overall .
fantastic mediterranean fare highly recommend the sometimes a cigar is just a cigar for an appetizer which is crispy dough filled with mozzarella honey almonds and basil absolutely mouth watering .
the food is not bad however this is ny and so im not short of choice when it comes to great restaurants i guess next time i feel like dealing with 45 condescending b that congregate around the hostess podium ill come back here read never .
i live around the corner they just opened the food was amazing great service but we did wait over 10min for the main i guess its because they just opened still the food was crazy good 5 stars yes .
for dinner this place is spot on great crowd good food avoid like the plague gor brunch unless of course you want to deal with a bunch of inconsiderate parents that bring their loud screaming kids to brunch .
zizi rocks .
average food and ambiance .
the best peruvian food in town .
kind of insanely overpriced but if youre too lazy to find any of the other million italian places in new york than barbuto is a total winrar btw you can get the same dishes only better at bianca for under half the price nice interior exterior though .
excellent food drink and service our bartender was super nice the pizza guys were so attentive the only reason why i didnt give it 5 stars no availability to make reservations .
i got delivery from here it took a long time the sausages were good the sides i didnt like amd for the amount of money we paid it was incredibly expensive .
i love this place it is my go to place for great pizza and wine the staff is fabulous and always makes us feel special try the kennet pizza it will not disappoint its salty creamy and very earthy with the fresh rosemary they also have great specials .
local dive bar with bad dive bar food and cheep beer watch what you order or risk getting the gi bleed .
so fresh and tasty from the fresh ricotta cheese to the hand made pasta it all melts in your mouth we really enjoyed the chefs choice meat and cheese appetizer a wide range of flavor .
used to be great but lately the food isnt what it used to be the staff is polite but there was one new girl who actually seem as she was forced to work there so unhappy and rude hey management whats going on .
no ones pizza is as good as zavino i feed my addiction monthly and last night had the pear salad and polpettini pizza i love the cozy atmosphere the wonderful aroma and the friendly service .
chicken not good hot sauce uhmn so so service is wack jalea not good the taste is like american food and ceviche was good but they xhange a lot so i might try again the following month and see if they got better .
good crowd i had a margherita pizza here and it was one of the tastiest pizza in philly .
update service has taken a nosedive as of late not just once but the last couple of visits sorry but there is plenty of chicken places around here adios el pollo inka peru .
very warm ambience a little noisy i wasnt to fond of the television in the bar area pizza is really good nice location .
overpriced and tasteless food the first bad meal was the ton katsu the meat tasted like it was in the freezer for a year the second bad meal was the steak teriyaki seriously how do you screw up steak .
by far my favorite place to get pizza in philly cozy atmosphere speedy service and delicious pizza go for happy hour go with a date go with yourself just go .
as a tried to become a regular for my breakfast meals i slowly got more and more discourage with the service here customer service progressively got worst waistresses need a how to treat customer 101 course badly .
another good recommendation from a ny coworker who had her rehearsal dinner here seating is a bit cramped but a fun bustling place a good variety of salads pizza and pasta my arugula and pistachio pesto pizza was delish as was my hubbys prosciutto and béchamel pizza .
been here a few times and its nothing like the old willys its very expensive and the food seems to be all cisco heat and serve not very tasty at all the service was not too friendly either .
their cheese and meat plate is the best top quality selections it comes with some kind of sweet jam that is really tasty their pizza is great too .
just a disguised diner had some eggs over easy this morning eggs were cooked right but the home fries were a pile of tasteless bland potatoes come on guys this in nj land of home fries kudos for having strawberry jam for my toast though .
rosemary flat bread excellent diavolo great cheese pizza for kids very good draft beer hop devil very good seating outside brutal slanted sidewalk wobbly tables are tough w kids recommend absolutely but sit inside w kids .
it turned out outside drinks are not allowed we were not allowed in because we had smoothie in hands they said they could save the drink in the fridge but the smoothie will thaw after the meal that was not nice .
theres a warm place is my heart for this place pizza cocktails artisanal cheesemeat board and charming setting make this place a real delight small draught list but a nice alcoholic selection overall go for a swanky second date or a great happy hour .
food is bland and too much msg overhyped and too modernized it doesnt taste authentic enough for it to even pass as a mediocre vietnamese restaurant .
best pizza in the city this place is great for a date or very small group the wine list is impressive and there is something for everyone zavinos is a place i will always go to when i want pizza always fresh ingredients .
big fancylooking restaurant with boring food waiters are cloyingly obnoxious vegetarians beware they will try to feed you fish even after you explain your dietary needs vegans ditto only add eggs to the lookoutcuztheseguysdontgetit list split the scene and go around the corner to vientiane instead .
great pizza i love it they have gluten free pizza and yummy olives too highly recommend the place is a but cramped and they dont take reservations so just be prepared to wait a bit on the weekends always have great service .
sadly the service and food has steadily gone down hill good drinking bar but the restaurant side needs attention menu is tired .
as far as im concerned this is the only place you can get good pizza in this city you can find ray behind the bar he makes the place feel like cheers only more refined .
ordered a french dip and chicken cheesesteak got an ice cold roast beef sandwich with no au jus and a chicken cutlet with cheese will not go back stay away .
every time i go to zavino i have a great fabulous meal and a great time love the pizza ive also had spaghetti squash and it was wonderful its fun to sit outside and people watch while enjoying your meal .
never ever ever again they had us wait for over an hour for our food while everyone else around us had ate and left the food was absolutely awful and they gave me a dirty cup to drink out of hello health department .
great front end service great salads but i think they forgot to cook our pizza as it took a long time to get id visit again though .
i was looking forward to trying zafra but i walked away very disappointed none of the dishes the appetizer sampler the coconut crusted tilapia and the arroz con pollo was very good i wont be back and i wouldnt recommend it to others .
great service and awesome food i personally prefer zavino over tria their price is comparable to their food quality and portioning im saying theirs is bigger remember bigger doesnt mean better love their spaghetti squash dish whatever that was its bangin i am coming back fo sho .
great service and atmosphere but food was too greasy tho good presentation as someone else mentioned i prefer soul de cuba you might enjoy it if you dont mind overgreasy food but i personally cant stand it .
the place was wonderful attentive waitresses and good service the wine was good food was excellent and they had outdoor seating my only complaint was that it was a bit cramped seating was tight .
not great old cold dry rice with the pork entree and an average salad its very overpriced for what you get but even if it were dirt cheap i wouldnt go back .
third favorite pizza in philly love the hh specials cant go wrong with the marguerita pizza and draft beer selection is good with reasonable prices for a restaurant make sure you check the specials board inside .
food was okay its fast food essentially the food was kind of tasteless and they charged us for getting hot sauce .
i love this place its comfy and cozy great for when its cold or raining we sit near the oven and watch all the pizzas cook never a bad choice their house made pastas are amazing .
slowslowslow service staff was not welcoming nor friendly it took ten minutes for a server to even acknowledge us only giving it two stars because my coworkers mis higas breakfast and my cobb salad were delicious .
zavino definitely has one of the best cheese and meat boards in the city and the service is always great ive had sasha as a server many times and she never disappoints keep it up guys .
beautiful location zero wait and perfect spot to wander in after hanging out by the water however food was disappointing after all the hype surrounding the location on mott st .
we had a terrific experience outdoor dining on a friday afternoon cheese and meat plate with wine and people watching .
thanks for the dish water we actually ask for a coffee .
it is really all its cracked out to be i had the veal topped pizza and a bourbon smash and will be definitely going back for more before my work trip is over .
my wife i were seated for breakfast and were not waited on for 15 minutes i counted even the diners next to us were wondering where the waitstaff went we quickly left and went elsewhere .
easily the best pizza ive ever had and thats saying a lot the cured meats olives etc etc are all great also but the pizza is just ridiculously good .
croque monsieur it is simply not ok to make one using rye bread i mean would you bake a cake with rye bread what about rye bread donuts rye cookies rye flour anyone on the bright side probably one of the best bloody marys around .
this places pizza helped understand what life truly meant it tasted very fresh and beautiful also very great and heroic i ordered the joey and eggplant parm no regrets reasonably priced super service and overall great restaurant for an intimate date or small group outing .
ill only come here if im feeling snobby the food is ok but the atmosphere is uck what is happening to brooklyn .
had two different pizzas beat salad was excellent and the rabbit ravioli was amazing they make all pastas in house which i love .
they are not babystroller friendly i wont go back i guess they dont want my familys business telling us to go elsewhere nearby when they were empty for late lunch .
ricotta of the day was awesome and the 2 pizzas we tried stache mortadella were delicious .
very disappointing incredibly rude staff and mediocre food my husband and i have been a few times and we always expect a better experience but we always leave disappointed i wont be back .
do not ever pass up the vegetable plate or the eggplant parm pizzas are tasty sangria in a warm day is a hit .
so slow to deliver the food we wait for 40mins for the entrees dont come if you wanna get a dinner in a hour .
brussels sprouts appetizer and joey pizza were the bomb highly recommend probably should have sat inside because sitting outside felt a little like sitting in the street other than that great place .
2 stars is probably generous we ate there on saturdau ordered the special pasta puntanesca the food was average at best service was incredibly slow .
delicious food very good service the vegetables here are absolutely fantastic great for vegetarians however can be hard to get a table love love love the food .
i want to like it and i do but ill never go back beer selection is excellent the food is good a little pricey but nice quality very quaint little bar one star is for service and thats all i am going to say about that .
did i mention that i am obsessed with zavino .
called at 1045 on a friday to see how busy they were and if the kitchen is open until 12 it went to voicemail twice .
came in late on a saturday and found 3 seats at the bar service was impeccable and the joey pizza is one of the finer things in life cant wait to be back it was crowded but the atmostphere was bustling and fun .
interesting to try these oldschool cocktails but the stink from the oil lamps on all the tables made me eager to leave .
had a great pizza perfect size for two good wine good service and fair price we would def go back .
theres two floors the first one of which is a typical neighborhood bar and the second one of which is a wannabespeakeasy setting with ceilings too low stools that want to topple over and waitresses that have better things to do than serve your drinks .
cute spot great location excellent staff decent prices food was mediocre id try again .
you cant make a reservation and trying to go with a group is a nightmare .
one of the best things i have ever tasted is their shrimp scampi appetizer the only thing wrong with it is that it isnt an entree this place has very unique offerings and is a great evening out very busy so call ahead first .
it took 23 mins for my halohalo order crazy lack of anticipation on their part bananajackfruit pie is my fave part .
highly recommend the baby jesus and the veal meatballs both were cooked well and tasted delicious the pizzas are nice as well i prefer going to this place in the summer with the outdoor seating option .
i feel cheated i wanted to try the aloha burger today i open the box and guess what no pineapple or bacon it .
solid choice in terms of service friendly vibe at the bar and of course the food in other words i enjoyed it reasonably priced too .
i dont understand how they can be open for business when more than half of the items on their menu is unavailable my sister boyfriend and i went to jollibees on a wednesday morning with a built up appetite and nothing we wanted was available thats ridiculous .
ridiculously good food in town from l a and cant wait to come back eggplant parm is amazing .
so disappointed came here at 545pm on a tuesday to buy some lumpia and they were sold out id figure they would have lumpia in stock before the dinner crowd gets here maybe they didnt get restocked because of the snowstorm but its still unacceptable .
i had two great dishes during my visit baby jesus meat and cheese and the stache pizza i would love to come back and try their other menu items it is a little cramped in there so if your neighboring table tells a joke be prepared to laugh .
just pure nostalgia for filams nothing spectacular about the food service and location hard to park during peak time one endearing thing i can say is if you grew up in jersey city there is a high probability you will see a fellow filam friend or classmate .
love this place philadelphias pizza scene is burgeoning and zavino is right out front very inventive super crisp pies interesting wines by the glass and a great cheese board to start .
just sat here for exactly 25 minutes without being acknowledged i wish i couldve tasted the food it wasnt too busy .
loved the place cute atmosphere and food was great .
food was fresh but it really wasnt anything special the staff was rude and not friendly in the least bit its a good last minute spot but not the place for a really good meal .
delicious pizza but a little over priced for what you get however i would definitely recommend this place to anyone looking for great pizza ill be back .
make sure u wont sit in downstairs it smells horrible the foods are just all right .
if i could give more than 5 stars i would the diavolo pizza is the best ive ever had in my life which is saying a lot coming from someone who eats pizza multiple times a week they also have great happy hour specials .
ill keep this short and sweet im on the trail of the best pho in ct york street noodle houses pho broth is bland their kimchi dumplings are too next .
best gourmet pizza ive ever had ever we had the stache pizza the beet salad avocado salad were both incredible as well we skipped wine went with beer so no comment there service was great even on a busy night will definitely keep going back .
love the concept but too much lettuce and barely any toppings you will understand after you eat there once its all salad a little less salad and more toppings would be nice .
amazing pizza wine atmosphere of a sidewalk cafe lovely evening awesome wait system they text you when your table is ready so you can explore some of the great shops nearby .
pizza tastes like cardboard the cheese was extremely oily and the sauce was nonexistent the staff was rude never coming back .
actually a decent thin crust pizza in center city the pizzas are crispy and flaky and the toppings fresh and interesting watch out as you gobble it down you may burn the roof of your mouth .
unfortunately i could only rate one star and not zero pizza was below average we had chicken marsala and it tasted like it came out of a can avoid this place and save your money .
had the chorizo pizza almost too much cilantro but very good nonetheless good service and atmosphere as well if they had ac it would be 5 stars haha .
had a quick lunch here slice pizza seemed comparable to any other places the meatball parm was a disappointment they must buy frozen meatballs at restaurant depot and serve it on a roll because it was pretty gross how hard is it to make a fresh meatball .
bam this place is absolutely amazing tasting board chock full of crazy good meats and cheeses with accompaniments eggplant parm stack veal meatballs packed with flavor and gnocchi so good we ordered it twice for wine sangria and shareable apps this place is the bees knees .
not a fan ive been to this place a dozen times hoping the service would get better but its a hit or miss .
my favorite place in philly ever .
very disappointing i ordered the cheesesteak with on a plain roll the meat and cheese had something foreign in it like grit i could only eat 1 bite .
sweetest staff cute spot good location very fair prices no complaints .
been meaning to try this place for a whilehighly recommended by a friend had the tuna sandwich good but got terribly sick after word also sage tea was nice .
great spot small and with a lot of character food was awesome and great drink menu staff was also really nice and helpful great lunch spot .
i ordered the spinach pies not very good soggy no real taste also got the artichoke chicken salad portion size was huge but chicken was dry .
as good as pizza gets in pennsylvania the quality rivals that of the top nyc pizzerias .
lacklustre service soggy lukewarm spinach pie and twodayold cucumber salad go to local instead .
highly recommend this place amazing pizza and very friendly fast service .
hmmm soso i cant much about it other than nothing really note worthy .
polpettini pizza the best pizza ive ever had the crust is amazing chewy and flavorful im pairing it with a syrah hope to be able to visit again soon .
hummus place is way better snack is a rip off i got a platter of three appetizers it cost 13 so i was expecting a decent amount of hummus but snack gave me three little containers and not even enough pita to eat it with .
everything about our meal tonight was amazing the outoftown cousins who are serious foodies gave it their approval and still our kids who wont eat anything weird loved their pizzas too we shared five pizzas six different small plates and two salads and very little was left over .
despite being an outdoor space they are not dogfriendly given that they are right next to the dog park this is a real bummer the restaurant that formerly occupied this exact same space was very dogfriendly .
love this place my husband and i come here often for pizza and a few drinks they also have delicious assorted meats and cheeses definitely a hidden gem in philadelphia and its way better and less expensive than stella .
my fish sandwich consisted of overfried shods of what seemed to be leftover fish bun was hard as a rock disgusting and the cashier had zero personality .
located in the heart of 13th streets restaurant row unfortunately it is often overlooked because of barbuzzo lolita and jamonera excellent place for wine and pizza highlights joey pizza baby jesus olives veal and ricotta meatballs no reservations though .
i tried their fish and chips i didnt like it the fish was not fresh and it was very oily .
the food is delicious i eat here every time im in town i love the margherita pie grilled shrimp scampi and the riesling the kennett is ok .
pizza wasnt great very bland ordered online and wrong order was delivered the order was fixed but with no money taken off nothing done .
they serve a thin crust pie and it would have been better if the center was just a bit more crisped but it was very tasty not bad pizza .
looks good on the surface with lots of different styles and options for pizza but both times ordering via eat24 led to a lousy experience subpar food order mistakes order from stretchs instead .
not bad .
philly breakfast sandwich was disgusting breadbun was way too big with no vegetables lettuce tomato etc and scrapple itself was gross should have gone to china town .
wonderful combinations and pizza the crust was outstanding .
i went there for sunday brunch and was unimpressed people who were seated well after me were served before me i had to ask more than once before they finally brought me some water and the eggs benedict were simultaneously overcooked and cold .
tasty pizza appealing atmosphere friendly wait staff .
the veggie burger patty looked like it was deep fried and was slathered with mayo youre doing it wrong kite key only reason im not giving a 1 star rating is because our server was pretty cool .
great atmosphere and staff the best pizza around and a great wine section to match had the mushroom soup with truffle oil and their veal meatball pizza wow always friendly and inviting with attentive management .
tasteless food service was ok person who brought our food seemed annoyed when we asked for ketchup fries seemed like they were microwaved breakfast burrito had no flavor even with the side sauce potatoes were too salty .
meat and cheese plates are delicious and plentiful pan roasted squid was cooked well and pizzas are creative and flavorful ambience and service perfect for a low key chill night in the city .
went here later at night for drinks and a snack there was a cockroach crawling on the wall next to our table the waitress did nothing about it and made an excuse it was discussing dont come late at night unless you want cockroach as an appetizer .
i loved this place not only were their bottles of wine reasonably priced but they were good great pizzas cute interior and the vibe overall was low key i wish there was a place like this in my neighborhood this was quite the little downtown gem .
cold food .
the best pizza ive had in philadelphia the pizza is unique and extremely fresh and the place has a cool vibe .
what kind of restaurant dyes corn chips to make them blue corn chips if youre hurting for a meal that will turn your poop a radiant blue look no further than kite keys nachos .
best pizza ever cooks in an 850 degree oven for two minutes great atmosphere neighborhood outdoor seating .
food ok service slow restrooms disgusting 2 had no toilet paper 3rd had no lighting to find it thank goodness for my phones flashlight .
this is a wine bar that also has awesome food very rare combination but their pizzas are die for they also have a gluten free option that my glutenless friends tell me is pretty good .
chicken as an app was good reuben needs improvement and beingclassic comes with coleslaw and no fries hamburger ordered cooked raw .
amazing pizza loved the atmosphere they take great pride in their dishes and the wait staff always had good recommendations combined with a strong knowledge of what they offered would definitely revisit .
dont make the mistake we made by coming here the food was terrible the burger was dry and had no flavor not to mention the service was bad the owner really needs to make some changes to his staff .
great place probably one of the best pizza places ive been to great assortments if meats to top your pizza and a great selection of beer to compliment that tasty pizza ill be sure to go back soon .
for a place called elbow room there sure is a lot of room for improvement they clearly havent read all these horrible reviews .
zavino is an excellent place for pizza with a great ambiance i ordered the mushroom and margarita pizzas and loved them both their wine list is well rounded too the 13th street area is quickly becoming a destination neighborhood for good food .
felt i was on restaurant rescue looked around for cameras but didnt see any worst food i ever had in west hartford real slap in the face exiting and seeing billy grants across the street .
great place .
poor quality food generally abrasive service no real ambiance to speak of im not sure how this place manages to remain open with so much competition within walking distance .
the food here is really good the sheeps milk ricotta was very flavorful and the bread was delicious every we tried was tasty and fresh it is definitely a nice little wine bar ill be back .
the kobe burger was dry and mostly indedible despite the fact that i asked for it medium the wine wasnt properly cooled and the waiter was rude and unapologetic never again .
just like all the other reviews i was impressed by zavino pizza was excellent environment was very good nothing negative to say not even particularly expensive but wow the pizza so tasty you really cant go wrong on the 13th street sansomchestnut block .
nice outside deck to hang out on beersticky tables and floor are a turn off but a nice space .
lets keep this short and sweet delicious delicious delicious pizza still love gianfranco rustica but this is right up there too which to choose thats a great problem to have .
ive only eaten at the bar which is very small and the food was ok with so many choices so close by i would opt for somewhere else .
zavino is a great place for happy hour good pizza options good deals on wine and beer plus outdoor seating works for me they last time i was here there was a mummers band playing in the doorway kind of bizarre but equally awesome .
i used to have a great time at this place or great by west hartford standards anyway however the last time i went there something got dropped into the drinks of my friend and i and we spent the entire night puking gross .
we love this place and cant say enough good things about the food staff and service .
i forgot to share the threatening message the owner sent to me about a year ago the friends who are writing the positive reviews should be ashamed he said i dont understand you getting so personal going after me i dont even know you now i do .
this place is consistently great the menu is not very large but the quality of the food is outstanding .
one word gastroenteritis my dad and i went over the holidays and both of us have had upset stomachs since then now i have to take antibiotics great .
this was the best pizza i have had in the longest time such an amazing variety of food with combinations that not only entice the taste buds but ingredients that beyondflatter each other bravo .
i hate to write a bad review of this place but ive been here about three times and although the staffowners are unbelievably sweet the coffee and ambiance just arent up to par .
twice this week ive taken outoftowners there both crowds raved food is always great and the bartenders are fantastic .
quite honestly the worst cup of coffee i have ever had i cant even explain how terrible it tasted and i watched them brew it so i know it was fresh it tasted like vinegar its a shame because the place is clean and attractive .
delicious food great time definitely a great spot .
had a bad experience with this place took my sis along with me to this joint since we eat only chicken asked if they have chicken param they remade the cheese pizza they had into chicken param soo the crust was like biscuits i couldnt eat them .
their meat and cheese tasting board is amazing great wine delicious beers and the staff is always super nice did i mention the pizza margarita delicious best pizza in philly we go every friday for happy hour .
ordered their special vegetarian pizza and buffalo wings pizza was very bland and ha brocoli on it wings are very bad will never go back to this place .
really good place for a quick pizza or a longer dinner not too loud for being such a small place the meat they put on their pizzas is really really good nice friendly service .
ordered a veggie pie and it was ok it tastes overcooked probably wouldnt go back .
good small plates and cool atmosphere hang out at the bar .
